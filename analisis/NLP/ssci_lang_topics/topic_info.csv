In 2023, amidst a period of profound relativisation and denial of Fundamental Rights, Chile commemorated 50 years of the civil-military dictatorship. During the October 2019 revolt, serious human rights violations were committed by agents of the State, most of which have not reached judicial closure. In this context, the latest survey of the National Institute of Human Rights indicates that the population negatively perceives the country’s guarantee and protection of human rights. This factor is relevant considering three decades of transitional justice and the human rights commitments undertaken by the Chilean State. Human Rights Education aimed at creating a culture of respect for human rights and generating an education of freedom that combats all forms of discrimination and violence constitutes a significant training component of Social Work, a human rights profession. The literature signals, nevertheless, various difficulties in truly incorporating this approach in educational trajectories and projects. Methodology. An exploratory and quantitative study was conducted of the human rights perceptions of students enrolled in a state university Social Work degree in the north of Chile. An online questionnaire was administered to a simple random sample (154 cases) with a 95% margin of error. The instrument was structured around open-ended, multiple-choice, and ordinal questions which were subsequently processed and analysed. Results. A positive perception of human rights was found. They were understood to be a tool enabling the protection of people’s dignity, and were associated with concepts such as equality, dignity, respect, and freedom. However, a negative perception of the guarantee of human rights was also encountered, a finding which is consistent with national results and other perception surveys implemented in Argentina. In relation to human rights training, the participants positively valued the knowledge provided in the Social Work degree. They requested, however, more elements to identify recourse instances when observing violations and more training in specific enforceability tools. Discussion. According to the evidence in the literature, the results coincide with other studies that have shown favourable human rights perceptions, while identifying a series of violations, especially in Economic and Social Rights. Thus, there is a clear need to link human rights training with daily Social Work practice through active methodologies. This would allow ensuring the training of critical agents capable of assuming the defence and promotion of human rights. Conclusions. It is necessary to advance in the strengthening of Human Rights Education in Social Work from a critical perspective. Considering the country’s context of neoliberal rationality, concrete tools must be provided allowing to fully exercise and guarantee the necessary rights.', 'TITLE: Influence of Workplace Support for Families and Family Support on Family-to-Work-Conflict and Family Satisfaction in Dual-Earner Parents with Adolescents during the Pandemic | KEYWORDS: Actor-partner interdependence model; Adolescents; Conflict; Dual-earner parents; Family satisfaction; Support | ABSTRACT: Organizational and family support may be invested to reduce workers’ family-to-work conflict and increase their and their family members’ family satisfaction. However, data on the extent to which workplace and family support, family-to-work conflict, and family satisfaction were linked during the COVID-19 pandemic for workers and their families is still limited. This study explored the actor and partner effects between perceived workplace support for families and perceived family support, family-to-work conflict, and family satisfaction, in different-sex dual-earner parents with adolescents and the mediating role of parents’ family-to-work conflict. In the Metropolitan Region of Chile, 430 dual-earner parents and their adolescent child (mean age of 12.8 years, 53.7% female) were recruited for the study. Mothers and fathers responded to measures of family-to-work conflict and perceived workplace support for families and the Perceived Family Support Scale. The three family members answered the Satisfaction with Family Life Scale. Analyses were conducted using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model and structural equation modeling. Results showed that mothers’ and fathers’ perceived workplace support for families and perceived family support helped reduce their family-to-work conflict; no other association involving parents’ perceived workplace support for families was significant. By contrast, direct actor and partner effects were found between parents’ perceived family support and the three family members’ family satisfaction. Family-to-work conflict showed two significant mediating roles: One intraindividual in fathers and one intraindividual from fathers to adolescents. These findings indicate that resources both parents gain from perceived family support positively affect the three family members’ family satisfaction by different mechanisms and underscore the importance of family support for family satisfaction during the pandemic.', 'TITLE: Influence of Workplace Support for Families and Family Support on Family-to-Work-Conflict and Family Satisfaction in Dual-Earner Parents with Adolescents during the Pandemic | KEYWORDS: Actor-partner interdependence model; Adolescents; Conflict; Dual-earner parents; Family satisfaction; Support | ABSTRACT: Organizational and family support may be invested to reduce workers’ family-to-work conflict and increase their and their family members’ family satisfaction.

However, the emergence of new theoretical approaches has resulted in the identification of a problem: organizing and describing the necessary professional knowledge to teach stochastics. Objectives: The aim of this research is to characterize the didactic-stochastic knowledge needed for pre-service mathematics teachers, considering Chile as a case study. Design: Following a qualitative perspective, through a content-analysis. Setting and Participants: The Pedagogical and Disciplinary Standards for Mathematics Teaching Programs. Data collection and analysis: The national guidelines on the stochastic education of pre-service’ teachers were analysed to collect text fragments describing professional knowledge expected in pre-service teachers. Results: We obtained a set of 37 indicators organized according to the Didactic-Mathematical Knowledge Model, which includes disciplinary aspects (stochastic content), the knowledge of students and their learning (cognitive content) and interests (affective content), instruction processes (interactional and mediational content) and their link with the educational context and other knowledge areas (ecological content). Conclusions: We hope that the identified indicators become a useful tool to organize and evaluate stochastic education programs for pre- and in-service teachers. Moreover, we highlight the replicability of the method uses and the possible adaptation of results to other educational contexts.', ""TITLE: Pedagogical mentoring in Chilean schools: an innovative approach to teachers' professional learning | KEYWORDS: Chilean school context; Coaching; Collaborative professional development; Pedagogical mentoring; Teacher learning | ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the conditions and challenges that facilitate teacher professional learning through the implementation of pedagogical mentoring (PM) within the Chilean school context. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a qualitative methods approach, utilizing an instrumental case study. As the primary data source, researchers conducted 14 individual, semistructured interviews. Participants included two comentors, six mentor teachers and six mentee teachers from two K-8 focal school sites. Data were examined using the content analysis method. Findings: Results revealed five aspects that contributed to PM's execution: the voluntary participation model, the reflective emphasis, the focus on teaching and learning, the facilitating role of the principal and comentor support. At the same time, the findings indicated three factors that hindered PM's success: interruptions due to schedule conflicts, limited dissemination throughout the school community and assimilation of the values embedded in the Chilean teacher evaluation system. Practical implications: PM holds great potential for collaborative professional development and continuous improvement of teachers' instructional practices, drawing on their experiences and resources and leading to the strengthening sense of professionalism in teaching and in teachers' social esteem. Originality/value: This is the first research to address a formal PM project in Chile aimed specifically at in-service teachers. Previous projects in the country have focused on novice teachers. Unlike other initiatives in the region, this project does not focus on teacher induction but on capacity building within schools through collaborative work. This research also adopts an approach based on support for teachers' professional development, while in Chile the main policies currently focus on teacher evaluation."", ""TITLE: Pedagogical mentoring in Chilean schools: an innovative approach to teachers' professional learning | KEYWORDS: Chilean school context; Coaching; Collaborative professional development; Pedagogical mentoring; Teacher learning | ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the conditions and challenges that facilitate teacher professional learning through the implementation of pedagogical mentoring (PM) within the Chilean school context.

Evidence from Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; expectancy-value theory; gender stereotypes; Vocational and Technical Education; women in STEM | ABSTRACT: Women face many barriers to entry into and persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Drawing on expectancy-value theory (EVT) and using a qualitative approach, this study sought to deeply understand women’s entry and persistence in STEM-related postsecondary Vocational Technical Education (VTE) programs that lead to male-dominated skilled trades in construction, metalworking, and mining sectors in Chile. The findings revealed that, depending on the economic sector women were preparing to work in, different motivational patterns of EVT beliefs emerged that allowed women to overcome the high costs imposed by the gender stereotypes they encountered in their studies. Therefore, to improve women participation in VTE programs related to STEM fields, institutional and government policies must consider these different motivational profiles, as well as different strategies to improve women identity with these male-typed skilled trades.', 'TITLE: Gender gap in STEM pathways: the role of secondary curricula in a highly differentiated school system—the case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Gender differences; Higher education; STEM pipeline; Vocational education | ABSTRACT: Background: STEM fields are instrumental in increasing the technological and innovative capacity of the economy. As women are underrepresented in the STEM workforce, diverse strategies have been implemented to boost their preparedness and interest in these fields, including early exposure to academic and vocational STEM courses. Using the case of Chile’s highly differentiated school system, this paper examines the role of secondary curricula on students’ enrollment and persistence in STEM programs offered by vocational postsecondary institutions and universities. In doing so, we seek to identify whether exposure to STEM courses within the academic or vocational tracks translates into fewer gender differences in STEM higher education. Results: Our results reveal that upper-secondary tracks connected to STEM courses are positively associated with enrollment in STEM higher education and, to some degree, persistence. More specifically, exposure to STEM courses in the academic track is the most effective path to boost chances of enrolling in STEM university programs but has no connection to later persistence. In contrast, applied STEM courses within the vocational tracks perform better in the case of STEM programs in postsecondary vocational institutions both in enrollment and persistence. However, this STEM pipeline significantly amplifies gender gaps as males benefit more than women from early exposure to applied STEM courses. We also found that other indirect routes, such as enrolling in STEM university programs from the vocational track with applied STEM courses, boost female participation in these programs, helping reduce gender gaps. Conclusions: While secondary STEM courses attract more female students to STEM higher education, they alone are insufficient to achieve gender equality in STEM fields as gender gaps widen in the more effective routes. In highly differentiated school systems, policymakers and high school leaders should offer increased support to women interested in STEM studies and careers across all secondary tracks to boost female participation in STEM fields. At the same time, all high school students should be able to select both academic and applied STEM courses as a part of their non-mandatory curriculum.', 'TITLE: Gender gap in STEM pathways: the role of secondary curricula in a highly differentiated school system—the case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Gender differences; Higher education; STEM pipeline; Vocational education | ABSTRACT: Background: STEM fields are instrumental in increasing the technological and innovative capacity of the economy.

Moreover, few studies on this role have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries. This study explores and describes the mental health actions undertaken by teachers in schools and categorizes them using latent class analysis. The study collected data from 726 teachers in Chile using snowball sampling. Three self-reported questionnaires were administered: Mental Health Actions and Teaching Role Questionnaire; Interprofessional Competence in Mental Health Questionnaire and Checklist of Mental Health Issues Addressed in School. The results showed that teachers play a significant role in identifying and addressing mental health issues among students, with 90% of respondents reporting that they had provided support to students with mental health concerns. The results also suggest that teachers face several challenges in this role, including a lack of training and resources, time constraints, and the need for better communication and collaboration with mental health professionals. Six latent class of teachers was founded: ow activity Class, Classroom-Centered Class, Individual Emotional Support-Centered Class, Self-Care and Professional Development Class, Mental Health Curriculum-Centered Class, and High activity Class. Based on the results provides applied recommendations for teachers to support their students' mental health, such as creating a safe and supportive classroom environment, promoting social-emotional learning, and collaborating with specialised school mental health professionals. Overall, this study highlights the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to school mental health that involves teachers, mental health professionals, and other stakeholders."", 'TITLE: Subjective theories of the Chilean teachers’ union about school climate and violence after the pandemic: a study of web news | KEYWORDS: Covid-19; school climate; school violence; subjective theories; teachers union | ABSTRACT: Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic increased school violence and worsened the school climate in Chile. In Chile, punitive control policies such as the Safe Class Law (Ley Aula Segura) have been adopted. A key actor in the public debate is the Chilean Teachers’ Union, due to its potential impact on new public policies on the issue.

Bus drivers often experience aggression from passengers and other road users, which sometimes escalate, eventually leading to violence. However, many road conflicts are rarely reported and, hence, difficult to study. This article analyses bus drivers’ reactions to conflicts with other motorists in Santiago (Chile), where public transport accounts for 35% of the total trips. Four percent of the population of bus drivers (639) responded to a survey with questions about job satisfaction, the bus route, and experiences of conflicts and accidents with other vehicles. A Mixed Logit model was estimated to explore bus drivers’ reactions to a conflict with motorised vehicles. The results show that bus driver's most frequent reaction is ignoring and carrying on. If a conflict escalates, bus drivers display aggressive reactions such as violently blowing the horn, insult louder, chucking the bus onto the other vehicle, overtake the vehicle off, or start a fist fight. Being a bus driver with no previous experience of violence with other public transport buses decreases the likelihood of violent reactions, while the opposite occurs with young drivers. Interestingly, the chances of having violent response increase when the driver was female. Public policies should start paying attention to the series of minor conflicts endured by bus drivers in their routines. These conflicts often are not reported to the authorities but nonetheless, exacerbate the chronic stress that bus drivers experience."", ""TITLE: An analysis of bus drivers’ interactions with motorists | KEYWORDS: Bus drivers; Conflicts; Driving behaviour; Latin America; Reactions | ABSTRACT: Driving a bus in the city is a task that demands attention to changing road conditions while dealing with passengers’ needs.

The travel time, waiting time, or the comfort level they will experience inside the vehicle are some of the most important reliability attributes. Reliability is usually neglected from travel behavioural models, since there is a lack of studies addressing its impact in travellers’ choices. This study proposes an in-depth analysis and characterization of travel time reliability in a public transport system using passive data only, which every day is getting more popular worldwide. The study is comprised of two parts, taking Transantiago (the public transport system of Santiago, Chile) as a study case, as it is a good representation of a frequency-based public transport system. In the first part a statistical and graphical analysis of travel times is conducted, focusing on characterizing headway and travel time reliability of public transport services as well as the effect of dedicated infrastructure, based on smartcard transactions and GPS information. In the second part an aggregate mode choice model based on revealed data is developed to analyse the effect of travel time reliability on travellers’ preferences. Overall, this study provides evidence of significant differences among headway variability and in-vehicle travel time dispersion different public transport modes. The standard deviation (a measure of dispersion) can be quite high for bus trips, while in the case of metro is smaller than 4 min independent of trip length. Regarding the aggregate public transport mode choice model, the coefficient of variation of headways is a key attribute to explain modal preferences. It was found that average bus users would accept traveling ~ 5 min longer to completely avoid headway irregularity. All these results were obtained by analysing passive-data from AFC and AVL systems only, which represents a novel approach for choice modelling. Transport modellers should consider the impact of service reliability to improve route choice and passenger assignment models, and better represent users’ perceptions and behaviour.""]"

H. antisensis is currently distributed throughout the Peruvian Andes, northern Chile, western Bolivia and northwestern Argentina, between 1800 and 5500 m above sea level. V. vicugna is distributed throughout northern Peru and northwestern Argentina, in environments that exceed 3200 m above sea level. The archaeological record of deer antlers on the Atacama coast has previously been documented at the Caleta Huelén-42 site (21°S). In the case of V. vicugna, fibers have been recovered only at the coastal site of Camarones-14 (19°S). A dating of 4180 ± 20 year BP obtained from V. vicugna bone and indirect dating of the antlers suggest an early social exchange between groups from coastal regions and those from the Atacama Desert Mountain range, as well as encourage to the potential record of remains/products of these animals in areas far from their natural habitats."", 'TITLE: Tracking kelp-type seaweed fuel in the archaeological record through Raman spectroscopy of charred particles: examples from the Atacama Desert coast | KEYWORDS: Atacama Desert; Charred particles; Coastal archaeology; Fuel; Kelp; Raman spectroscopy; Seaweed | ABSTRACT: The use of seaweed as fuel has been mentioned in ethnographic and historical sources of different coastal regions. Nevertheless, the archaeological record of seaweed burning is still limited to contexts where preservation is exceptional and macroscopic discrimination of charred remains is possible. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy in discriminating seaweed vs. plant/wood char. Our dataset (N = 92) consists of modern and archaeological seaweed and plant/wood charred remains, including specimens of unknown origin from the Atacama Desert coast, Northern Chile. The charred samples were processed to obtain 13 parameters which were then fed into five supervised machine learning models. The models, built on samples of known origin (seaweed and plant/wood), performed remarkably well in terms of accuracy, kappa, sensitivity, and specificity. The models were used for final predictions on 10 non-identified archaeological charcoals. Our results suggest that Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning techniques is a robust methodology for discriminating seaweed and plant/wood charred remains in the archaeological record. The predictions on unknown samples confirm that seaweed was used as fuel in a specific funerary ritual in the southern Atacama Desert coast around 5000 cal BP. Furthermore, charred specimens of Lessonia spp. recovered from combustion features in other northern Chile coastal settlements, suggest that seaweed pyrotechnology developed by Atacama Desert coast people is likely a long-term process.

Various measurement scales were utilized, including the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS), the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS), and the Gratitude Scale (CG-6). The sample consisted of 71 participants aged between 55 and 75 years. The results indicated that men exhibited higher levels of subjective happiness, better mental health, greater quality of life, and lower perceived stress and pain compared to women. However, when considering the variable of COVID-19-related deaths, significant differences were observed only in mental health and perceived stress between men and women among participants who had not experienced close losses. In conclusion, this study revealed differences in the physical-emotional state between men and women during the pandemic. Furthermore, it was found that the proximity of COVID-19-related deaths had a differential impact on mental health and perceived stress according to gender. These findings contribute to understanding the psychosocial effects of the pandemic on older adults and underscore the importance of considering gender differences in physical and emotional health during crisis situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'TITLE: Improving Long-Term Care Facilities’ Crisis Response: Lessons From the COVID-19 in Chile | KEYWORDS: aged care; Chile; COVID-19; long-term care; nursing homes; SARS-CoV-2 | ABSTRACT: Context: The COVID-19 pandemic hit Chile hard and affected older people the most. Through its National Service for Older Adults, the country implemented a strategy to prevent and mitigate infection and spread in long-term care facilities (LTCF), reaching regulated and registered residences and, for the first time, informal and unregistered residences. Objective: Identify the challenges and lessons from the COVID-19 response in LTCF with respect to the support received, the implementation of infection control measures, workforce challenges experienced and the measures adopted to promote residents’ wellbeing. Methods: An online questionnaire was sent to all LTCF managers (N = 385, Response Rate = 32.4%). Statistical tests compare results to identify differences across LTCF characteristics: residence size, location and management type (private, public or subsidized, or informal).

Through its National Service for Older Adults, the country implemented a strategy to prevent and mitigate infection and spread in long-term care facilities (LTCF), reaching regulated and registered residences and, for the first time, informal and unregistered residences. Objective: Identify the challenges and lessons from the COVID-19 response in LTCF with respect to the support received, the implementation of infection control measures, workforce challenges experienced and the measures adopted to promote residents’ wellbeing. Methods: An online questionnaire was sent to all LTCF managers (N = 385, Response Rate = 32.4%). Statistical tests compare results to identify differences across LTCF characteristics: residence size, location and management type (private, public or subsidized, or informal). Findings: Irrespective of their location, size or management, managers highlight common challenges during the crisis. They include limited personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, staff shortages, low quality of replacement staff, reduced staff mental health, and the difficulty to understand and implement protocols.

Due to the limited housing options the State provides, these settlements have historically developed forms of organization and struggle in search of their right to the city. Essentially, these actions focus on self-management to obtain a place to live. However, despite sharing similar needs, these groups show diverse forms of struggle. In the current context, with a growing demand for housing in the country, various strategies these groups adopt to integrate into the city can be observed. This article focuses on analyzing the occupation and spatial governance strategies implemented in two encampments located in the city of Temuco, Chile: Los Pinos and Los Ripieros, through a qualitative approach based on the application of a social mapping to the leaders of both settlements and the exploration of narratives related to past and future spatial governance. Differences were identified between these two encampments. Although they share a contiguous physical location and emerged at the same time, the results reveal that, despite initial similarities in urban development, there are differences in the motivations guiding their future actions. While Los Ripieros actively seeks to influence obtaining a permanent housing solution in other sectors of the city, Los Pinos chooses to get involved within the framework of existing urban regulations to secure a housing solution in the same place. These findings enrich the discussion on urban marginality by showing that the struggles for space of excluded groups are centered on the balance between rootedness and obtaining housing. The latter is vital for the state to consider when designing urban policies.', ""TITLE: Permeability of the indigenous space. discourses of mapuche landowners on urban expansion in periurbanian temuco, araucaniá-Chile Permeabilidad del espacio indígena discursos de propietarios mapuche sobre la expansión urbana en el periurbano de temuco, araucaniá-Chile | KEYWORDS: Extension to rural areas; Indigenous population; Suburbs; Urban planning; Urbanization | ABSTRACT: Cities are characterized by exerting constant pressure on peri-urban rural land.

Temuco, one of the most important intermediate cities in Chile in terms of population numbers, operates under the same logics. However, unlike other Chilean cities, the presence of Indigenous Territory Protection Areas (APTI) associated with Mapuche communities, establishes legal barriers that impede the conventional growth of the city.

El clientelismo en Paraguay: ¿Compra de votos o compra de participación electoral? | KEYWORDS: brokers; clientelismo; compra de participación electoral; Paraguay; partidos políticos | ABSTRACT: Clientelism in Paraguay is widespread and socially acknowledged by politicians and citizens. However, it is relatively understudied in the comparative literature. This article offers a qualitative, descriptive account of the main actors and logics of the clientelistic linkages between politicians and citizens in Paraguay, focusing on both long-term relations and practices deployed during electoral periods. The article argues that clientelism in Paraguay is anchored in territorial party structures, identification with the main political parties, and networks of brokers with ties to neighbors. During periods of electoral campaigns, particularistic exchanges intensify and culminate in turnout buying on election day. The article shows that in Paraguay, the relational and electoral parts of clientelism are inseparable, whereby the former conditions the latter. Thus, turnout buying stems from the relations built over long time periods. The research is based on in-depth interviews and fieldwork in four cities in the metropolitan area of Asunción.', 'TITLE: Clientelism and Vote Buying in Latin America: Lessons from Comparing Paraguay and Guatemala O clientelismo e a compra de votos na América Latina: lições da comparação entre Paraguai e Guatemala El clientelismo y la compra de votos en América Latina: lecciones de la comparación de Paraguay y Guatemala | KEYWORDS: clientelism; Guatemala; Paraguay; particularistic political strategies; separate tables; vote buying | ABSTRACT: Objective/context: Four decades after democratization in Latin America, particularistic ties—such as clientelism and vote buying—continue to exist between politicians and citizens in the region. This article seeks to understand how these practices have evolved over recent decades. Methodology: This study first draws on an original database encompassing all empirical articles from twenty-two Latin American political science journals and six Latin Americanist journals published between 2010 and 2022. It then examines two prototypical case studies based on secondary literature and press reviews. Conclusions: This article puts forward two main arguments. On one hand, clientelism and vote buying are relatively understudied in the region’s leading journals, and there are distinct conceptual, methodological, and empirical approaches in Spanish- and English-language scholarship. On the other hand, the article argues that, with the weakening of Latin American political parties, the overall logic of particularistic ties in the region is shifting from party-based clientelism (as seen in Paraguay) toward vote buying through independent local leaders (as seen in Guatemala). Originality: This article contributes to the literature on the transformation of particularistic ties and how they are studied in Latin America. First, it provides an original content analysis of Latin American and Latin Americanist journals from 2010 to 2022. Second, it synthesizes the main features of clientelism and vote buying in Paraguay and Guatemala—two relatively understudied cases that, despite showing high levels of particularistic practices, serve as prototypical examples of these two phenomena.', 'TITLE: Paraguay 2022: Personalization within a strong party system Paraguay 2022: Personalización dentro de un sistema de partidos fuerte | KEYWORDS: corruption; internal elections; Paraguay; personalization; political parties | ABSTRACT: The year 2022 in Paraguay was marked by internal elections of political parties and scandals related to corruption, insecurity, and organized crime. Former president Horacio Cartes was elected as the new president of the governing ANR, and his candidate, Santiago Peña, won the ANR internal elections to become the ruling party’s presidential candidate in 2023. The article argues that in this context, the two traditional parties opted, paradoxically, for opposing strategies, albeit with strong personalistic elements in both cases. In a political system characterized by a combination of personalistic politics and strong party machines, Cartes achieved to dominate the political scene, despite accusations of corruption against him. We argue that he diverted the attention from the corruption charges to conservative anti-gender issues in the public agenda and used this discourse to win ANR internal elections in the second half of the year. We also show that the ossification of the Paraguayan party system had negative consequences for democracy in the country in 2022, related to the personalization of political parties, corruption scandals in politics, and increased public insecurity and drug trafficking. Although party system collapse is unlikely, we conclude the article by showing that Paraguay can offer some comparative lessons for democracy in other Latin American countries.']"

In the present work focused on Chile, we use a high-resolution (∼5 km) gridded product (CR2Met v2.0) to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution and trends of HWs. We analyze daily maximum temperatures (Tx) from late austral spring to early autumn (November to March) to evaluate the HWs behavior during 1980–2020, using three criteria: i) three consecutive days with Tx > 30°C, ii) three consecutive days with Tx > 90th percentile (P90), and iii) three consecutive days with Tx > 95th percentile (P95). We validated our results using HWs statistics based on eighteen official meteorological stations; this procedure revealed a coherence with gridded data mainly over the Central Valley and the Andes. Using the P90 threshold, we found upward trends across the Andes between 20° and 36°S (>1 events per decade), and in the Central Valley between 34° - 43°S (>0.75 events per decade). In addition, using the P90 and P95 thresholds, HWs exhibit upward trends (>1 and 0.5 events per decade, respectively) throughout most of Chile, including Andes and Patagonia. Moreover, using all thresholds, we found an increase in HW frequency during the 2011–2020 megadrought period (ranging from 1 to 4 HWs events/decade) in comparison to the previous period (1980–2010). Meteorological factors such as an increase in the frequency of Puelche (Föhn-like) winds are proposed as an amplifying mechanism of HWs in South-Central Chile.', 'TITLE: Water crisis in petorca basin, Chile: The combined effects of a mega-drought and water management | KEYWORDS: Climate change; Conflicts for water; Drought; Streamflow reconstruction; Water access; Water management; Water scarcity | ABSTRACT: Since 2010, Chile has experienced one of the most severe droughts over the last century, the so-called mega-drought (MD). The MD conditions, combined with intensive agricultural activities and the current water management system, have led to water scarcity problems in Mediterranean and Semi-arid regions of Chile. An emblematic case is the Petorca basin, where a water crisis is undergone. To characterize this crisis, we analyzed water provision by using tree-ring records, remote sensing, instrumental data, and allocated water rights within the basin. Results indicate that the MD is the most severe dry period over the last 700-years of streamflow reconstruction. During the MD, streamflow and water bodies of the upper parts of the basin have been less affected than mid and low areas of this valley, where consumptive withdrawals reach up to 18% of the mean annual precipitation. This extracted volume is similar to the MD mean annual precipitation deficits. The impacts of the current drought, along with the drier climate projections for Central Chile, emphasize the urgency for faster policy changes related to water provision. Climate change adaptation plans and policies should enhance the current monitoring network and the public control of water use to secure the water access for inhabitants and productive activities.', 'TITLE: Alternative strategies for scaling up marine coastal biodiversity conservation in Chile | KEYWORDS: Artisanal fishers; Marine conservation; Marine protected area; Municipalities; Navidad; Territorial user rights | ABSTRACT: The continued degradation of marine ecosystems, along with the ecosystem services they provide, suggest that new, innovative approaches are needed to scale up marine biodiversity protection and promote sustainable fishery practices. We synthesize information from Chile on the key processes involved in the development of alternative strategies for scaling up marine biodiversity conservation and discuss the complementarities with marine protected areas. Defined as “ancillary” marine conservation initiatives under the Convention of Biological Diversity, we suggest that these alternative strategies have the potential to capitalize on local stakeholders’ participation and contribute to solving livelihood and governance issues while playing a significant role in scaling up marine conservation. We specifically focus on two recent ancillary initiatives being piloted in Chile. The development of business model innovations which could enable biodiversity benefits from territorial user rights fisheries policies and the creation of municipal conservation areas. We identify how these initiatives could eventually help scale up marine conservation, discuss opportunities and challenges from these pilot experiences and conclude with the need for developing policy frameworks and cross-scale governance approaches which formally acknowledge marine ancillary conservation measures as part of an integrated way to manage marine biodiversity. Exploring and supporting alternative complementary marine conservation strategies is particularly relevant in Chile and Latin America, if biodiversity conservation initiatives are to scale in coverage, contribute to livelihood improvement of local communities, replenish fisheries and play key roles in adaptation to climate change.']"

However, comparative political research has devoted less attention to South-South migration. We examine the impact of immigration on attitudes toward immigrants in Chile, which has experienced a threefold increase in its foreign-born population in the last decade. Using an instrumental variable design, we find that exposure to immigration increases hostile attitudes toward immigrants. Regarding the underlying factors driving hostile attitudes toward foreign-born groups, we find robust evidence pointing to immigration creating a public service shortage, which could explain the observed hostility. Conversely, we do not report evidence backing cultural anxieties or labor market competition. Hence, the Chilean case points to anti-immigrant attitudes gaining ground in contexts where welfare state provisions are limited and often precarious.', 'TITLE: (De)colonization runs deep: Mental health professionals working with Haitian migrants and activist mental health user and ex-user groups in Chile La (de)colonización va por dentro: profesionales de salud mental en el trabajo con migrantes haitianos y agrupaciones de usuarios y exusuarios activistas de servicios de salud mental en Chile | KEYWORDS: activist service-user and ex user groups; Chile; decolonization; Haitian migration; psy-disciplines | ABSTRACT: We explore the epistemic, political, and ethical contradictions and conflicts that mental health practitioners embody in their work and interaction with Haitian migrants and activist service-user and ex-user groups in the public health system in Chile –marked by neoliberalization processes during the last thirty years.

The study delves into the authentic historical context of the Civil Code provisions applicable to the subject in search of their rationale, within the context of general partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and single-owned limited liability businesses. Considering that the interpretation is conditioned by the business form and that the outcome should balance the interests of both business and personal creditors, it is concluded that in general partnerships and individual businesses, the personal creditors of an insolvent partner or owner can seek the winding up of the partnership or the business. In contrast, the personal creditors of a partner in a limited liability limited partnership cannot do so, as it would disrupt the balance between the two groups of creditors.', 'TITLE: INVOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION OF THE CHILEAN SOCIEDAD POR ACCIONES: INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS FOR SUPPOSED-TO-BE SOPHISTICATED PARTIES DISSOLUÇÃO POR DECISÃO JUDICIAL DA SOCIEDAD POR ACCIONES CHILENA: CONTRATOS INCOMPLETOS PARA PARTES SUPOSTAMENTE SOFISTICADAS Disolución por causa grave de la sociedad por acciones chilena: contratos incompletos para partes supuestamente sofisticadas | KEYWORDS: closely held corporation; Incomplete contracts; involuntary dissolution; shareholder disputes; sociedad por acciones | ABSTRACT: This paper analyzes the availability of the involuntary dissolution remedy, provided for closely held corporations, in the Chilean sociedad por acciones. It explores whether this remedy, devised to protect the minority shareholder against an unpredictable conflict, should be admitted when the legal form chosen was designed with the aim of encouraging investment in venture capital and, therefore, with sophisticated contract parties in mind. The dogmatic method is used, coupled with reference to the literature on incomplete contracting, in search of a criterion to determine whether and how the choice of form restricts judicial dissolution; and to apply that criterion to sole manager dispute cases. It is concluded that, among sophisticated parties, judicial dissolution should be limited to exceptional situations, while, among unsophisticated parties, should be considered available in the same cases as it would be in a corporation, whenever there are reasons that justify the choice of the sociedad por acciones form by inexperienced contract parties.', 'TITLE: The Judicial Exercise of the Involuntary Dissolution Remedy for Close Corporations Due to Serious Cause in Chilean Law El ejercicio de la acción judicial de disolución de la sociedad anónima cerrada por causa grave en el derecho chileno | KEYWORDS: close corporation; involuntary dissolution; shareholders conflicts | ABSTRACT: This paper analyzes the involuntary dissolution remedy devised for Chilean closely held corporations, focusing on a procedural perspective.

Exploratory Evidence from Four Dutch News Organisations | KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence; automated journalism\u200c; information sharing; journalism; Knowledge silos; responsible AI | ABSTRACT: The effective adoption of responsible AI practices in journalism requires a concerted effort to bridge different perspectives, including technological, editorial, and managerial. Among the many challenges that could impact information sharing around responsible AI inside news organisations are knowledge silos, where information is isolated within one part of the organisation and not easily shared with others. This study aims to study how knowledge silos might affect the adoption of responsible AI practices in journalism through a cross-case study of four Dutch media outlets. We examine individual and organisational barriers to AI knowledge sharing and the extent to which knowledge silos could impede the operationalisation of responsible AI initiatives inside these newsrooms. To address this question, we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with a strategic sample of editors, managers, and journalists at de Telegraaf, de Volkskrant, NOS, and RTL Nederland. The interviews aimed to uncover insights into the existence of knowledge silos, their effects on responsible AI practice adoption, and the organisational practices influencing these dynamics. Our results emphasise the importance of creating better structures for sharing information on AI across all layers of news organisations and highlight the need for research on knowledge silos as an impediment to responsible AI production.', 'TITLE: Adapting to Twitter: The Entanglement of Journalistic Values and Online Personas | KEYWORDS: journalistic values; Kosovo; online personas; political journalism; social media; Twitter | ABSTRACT: As more journalists rely on social media platforms like Twitter to gather information and report the news, scholars have identified an increasing tension between traditional journalistic values and reporters’ construction of online personas. Moreover, networked journalists build these mediated personas—following platforms’ affordances—to better engage with fellow journalists and algorithmic audiences. Drawing on data from 15 in-depth interviews with Kosovar Albanian political journalists and editors, this article offers a unique perspective by examining the negotiation process between professional standards and journalists’ online personas on Twitter. Via their online personas, influenced by the audience and the platforms’ affordances and logic, journalists and editors have given rise to new role conceptions and standards in local political journalism. The results show that political journalists and editors in Kosovo view Twitter as a platform where they can display both professional and personal layers of their identity. Furthermore, they feel unrestricted by journalistic standards, taking on roles outside the traditional scope of journalism: as good citizens, they express opinions on political issues; as activists, they advocate for personally meaningful causes; but they also see themselves as mordant critics of political figures.', ""TITLE: In search of balance.

The study utilizes eleven interviews with RTL Nieuws editorial members to gain insight into the influence of Smartocto, a tool for audience metrics, on the news production process. Through qualitative analysis, the experiences and perceptions of the journalists are analyzed. The interviews reveal that Smartocto does have an impact on the news production process of RTL Nieuws. The audience metrics provide journalists with insights into the preferences of the audience and can be used as a basis for editorial decisions. However, despite this influence, journalists retain their autonomy and have the freedom to make their own journalistic judgments. This research contributes to the understanding of the impact of audience metrics on the editorial autonomy of journalists. It demonstrates that while these data play a role in the news production process, journalists can still make their own journalistic choices.""]"

Chile, being the largest copper producer, also has the largest reserves in the world; therefore, it retains its potential to be a key player in future supply. This article explores some of the most relevant resource and technological challenges that may emerge with an accelerated development of brownfield and greenfield copper mining projects in Chile through 2035, without considering economic, regulatory, and environmental constraints. A “Full Scenario” was created to accommodate these conditions and restrictions. It includes estimates of future ore reserves, copper production, plant capacity, ore grades, energy and water consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and generation of tailings. Maximum production would exceed 10 million tons of contained copper from 2027 to 2030, with a resulting decrease of ore grades and the growth of energy and water consumption. The growth of indirect GHG emissions through 2035 is estimated at 18.4% less than copper production growth, because all new electric energy for this scenario would be based on renewable energy. Also, all new water used by 38 out of the 42 mining projects considered would be seawater, and some of the continental water used in 2019 would cease to be used in mining.', ""TITLE: Good deposits are not enough: Mining labor productivity analysis in the copper industry in Chile and Peru 1992-2009 | KEYWORDS: Chile; Copper; Geological features; Labor productivity; Panel data; Peru; Production scale | ABSTRACT: Chile and Peru produce almost 45% of world's mine copper output.

Patrocinato e governos partidários em Portugal | KEYWORDS: Elite interviews; Party government; Patronage; Public administration | ABSTRACT: Patronage has been interpreted as an important dimension of the party government model. However, patronage has been conventionally associated with the distribution of jobs in public administration aiming to reward services rendered to the party in government. This is not entirely satisfactory. The growing complexity of governance processes, together with the growing influence of the upper echelons of the civil service in policy making has prompted politicians to search for new ways of controlling the bureaucracy. Through the use of elite interviews, this article seeks to analyze the emergence of an instrumental dimension of patronage, as a potential key resource for parties in government to control the policy-making process and retain a role in modern democratic governance.', 'TITLE: The many faces of (party) appointments: Party government and patronage in Portugal, 1995-2009 | KEYWORDS: civil service; party government; patronage; Portugal | ABSTRACT: In recent years there has been a renewed interest in the political recruitment to non-elective public offices of the state. Such appointments can help entrench party organizations, cementing their position within the state and can also emerge as an instrument to provide parties with leverage over (and crucial information within) the increasingly fragmented and delegated processes of policymaking. Portugal has been conceived as a country with appointments deep into the administrative hierarchy, mainly motivated by partisan considerations. These accounts overlook the different rationales for patronage. This article aims to re-examine accounts on the (many) faces of patronage, by empirically exploring the logics of recruitment on three inter-related dimensions. First, to what extent different hierarchical levels are associated to different patronage functions. Second, by analysing the extent to which different moments of the governing period are associated to different faces of patronage. Third, by assessing the impact of party competition on patterns and logics of recruitment to the civil service.', ""TITLE: Party Patronage in Portugal: Treading in Shallow Water | KEYWORDS: Bureaucracy; Democratization; Party patronage; Party system dynamics; Political parties; Portugal | ABSTRACT: This chapter analyses patronage in contemporary Portugal. First, it provides a precise conceptualization of patronage and, second, bases its assessment on a detailed empirical basis which makes it comparable to the other cases analysed in this book. Third, and related, this chapter further specifies the dependent variable of patronage. The departure point is a neo-institutional one, that the nature of patronage in Portugal is unlikely to remain unaffected by changes in the country's institutional context. As such, it assesses not only the practice of patronage but also its scope, logic, and style, in order to better understand how democratization, the evolving nature of the Portuguese state and bureaucracy, as well as its parties and party system dynamics, have potentially impacted on the nature of patronage in Portugal.""]"

It is observed that these activities – especially those concerning his flute concerts, were framed in the typical model of a European traveling virtuoso of the 19th century, but in this case a Chilean one and through Chile – which constitute a novel and modernizing experience for a Chilean musician from this time, and unique, in any case, for a wind instrumentalist in the country during that century.

Samples comprised 268 participants for Study 1, and 160 for Study 2, who were cisgender, transgender, or nonbinary. All participants answered an online questionnaire with sociodemographic questions, a perceived social support scale, and a list of individuals to whom they disclosed their sexual orientation. In both studies, the predictors of sexual orientation disclosure were being gay or lesbian (vs. bisexual and other sexual minority individuals), not living with parents, and perceiving social support from others outside family and friends. Our findings show the need to expand the social understanding of sexual orientation beyond heterosexual-homosexual dichotomies, and to strengthen sources of social support in higher education to foster safer environments for sexual and gender minority students.', 'TITLE: The negative effects of internalized homonegativity on sexual satisfaction: dyadic effects and gender-based differences in Chile | KEYWORDS: Internalized homonegativity; internalized homophobia; minority stress; positive sexuality; same-sex couples | ABSTRACT: Heterosexism is not only expressed through sexual prejudice as an external stressor, but also as an internalized rejection toward one’s own (and others’) sexually diverse identity. That is, lesbian women and gay men themselves internalize negative societal attitudes toward their sexual orientation and identity—a phenomenon called internalized homonegativity. A wealth of research shows that internalized homonegativity negatively affects the health and social adjustment of gay and lesbian people. However, the literature has documented this trend from an individual (over a dyadic) perspective, and largely among gay (over lesbian) samples. To address this oversight, we analyzed data from 210 gay and lesbian couples in Chile to examine both actor and partner effects of internalized homonegativity on their sexual satisfaction. Results from moderation analyses from an actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) approach show that partners’ internalized homonegativity negatively affects actor sexual satisfaction, a pattern significantly moderated by gender; that is, only observed among lesbian couples. Our results further demonstrated that these effects hold above and beyond the actor and partner effects of age and relationship satisfaction, as well as relationship length. These results are consistent with the broader literature, which discusses the specific features of internalized homonegativity in lesbian women, characterized—among other aspects—by restrictive social demands over their sexuality. Accordingly, our findings highlight the deleterious relational consequences of internalized homonegativity and offer a relevant empirical contribution to the understanding of specific minority stress dynamics among lesbian women.', 'TITLE: The negative effects of internalized homonegativity on sexual satisfaction: dyadic effects and gender-based differences in Chile | KEYWORDS: Internalized homonegativity; internalized homophobia; minority stress; positive sexuality; same-sex couples | ABSTRACT: Heterosexism is not only expressed through sexual prejudice as an external stressor, but also as an internalized rejection toward one’s own (and others’) sexually diverse identity.

Specifically, we develop a simple theoretical model in which a public good is financed through proportional taxation, and that predicts a lower provision of public goods given an increase in the intergenerational earnings elasticity (IGE), which is widely recognized as a measure of the degree of economic persistence from one generation to the next in society. We test this model empirically using the results of the 2020 Chilean national plebiscite, which asked about the replacement of the standing constitution by a new one that would potentially expand the role of the state in the provision of public goods. Our estimates suggest the existence of a positive association between the IGE and the share of the vote against a new constitution, even after controlling for median income and income inequality. These findings are consistent with our model and suggest that sectors of society that exhibit higher degrees of economic persistence also show greater reluctance towards redistributive policies that increase public goods provision.', 'TITLE: The two-sample two-stage least squares method to estimate the intergenerational earnings elasticity | KEYWORDS: Intergenerational mobility; Linked administrative data; Two-sample two-stage least squares | ABSTRACT: We show that the inconsistency of the Two-Sample Two-Stage Least Squares (TSTSLS) Intergenerational Earnings Elasticity (IGE) estimator is a two-way prediction problem involving the replication of (i) the variance of unobserved parental earnings, and (ii) the endogeneity of unobserved parental earnings in the equation of children’s earnings. Concretely, we show that the TSTSLS estimator asymptotically recovers the OLS IGE when the first-stage R2, i.e., the share of explained variance of parental earnings, equals the share of explained endogeneity of parental earnings in the child’s earnings equation. This condition leads to two notable outcomes with respect to previous findings in the literature: (i) perfect prediction of parental earnings is a specific instance of our condition, indicating that consistency can be attained even when parental earnings are predicted imperfectly and (ii) exogenous instruments alone are insufficient to guarantee asymptotic equivalence between TSTSLS and OLS IGE estimates. Furthermore, our condition suggests that strong first-stage instruments might amplify TSTSLS bias if they are also strongly endogenous in the child’s earnings equation. This last result provides a formal criterion for choosing first-stage predictors under the assumption that TSTSLS IGE estimates exhibit upward bias. Additionally, we theoretically study the biases of the two-sample stochastic multiple imputation and cell multiple imputation (MI) procedures, identifying conditions under which MI procedures outperform the traditional TSTSLS estimator. Finally, we validate our results through an empirical Monte Carlo exercise using administrative data from the Chilean formal private sector.', 'TITLE: The two-sample two-stage least squares method to estimate the intergenerational earnings elasticity | KEYWORDS: Intergenerational mobility; Linked administrative data; Two-sample two-stage least squares | ABSTRACT: We show that the inconsistency of the Two-Sample Two-Stage Least Squares (TSTSLS) Intergenerational Earnings Elasticity (IGE) estimator is a two-way prediction problem involving the replication of (i) the variance of unobserved parental earnings, and (ii) the endogeneity of unobserved parental earnings in the equation of children’s earnings.

Dominant trends in Chile and Latin America's constitutional thought typically examine this type of process through the lenses of the constituent power or transformative constitutionalism. The authors of this essay offer a different view. They argue that Chile's constitution-making process, as designed by the multiparty agreement, manifests a double aversion: To avoid the Bolivarian way of constitution-making-including its associated constituent power narrative-and to put an end to the institutional and symbolic legacy of the Pinochet regime. In attempting to stay clear of these two negative models, the authors argue that the rules of the constitution-making process have adopted the main features of the post-sovereign model of constitution-making."", 'TITLE: What Constitution?

On the riots or social unrest that occurred in Chile in the last quarter of 2019 and early 2020, the Public Criminal Defense Office adopted a set of measures to offer legal defense to those who were detained or indicted by the criminal prosecution bodies. This research compares crime behavior in the country between 2017 and 2021 and identifies the social unrest crimes. These are a group of crimes whose frequency increased considerably during the turbulent months: 1) burglary, 2) public disorder, 3) disturbances to public order, and 4) attacks and threats against authorities. The volume and specificities of the social unrest crimes challenged the entire justice sector and, in doing so, made it possible to generate beliefs about the legitimacy of the criminal justice system. In contexts of social unrest, the generation of such beliefs seems especially important, because they can increase perceptions of injustice, enhancing the motivations that give rise to such unrest. Therefore, the operational reactions deployed in the Public Criminal Defense Office to ensure timely criminal defense services are explained.

The results of the analysis allow us to illustrate the social contribution that this Clinic makes in the Valparaíso Region by means of the processing of legal cases, as well as its contribution to the development of transitional justice policies regarding victims' reparation. It also makes it possible to make visible difficulties and possible improvements in the processing of such cases. The systematization carried out is an example for this type of initiative to be implemented in other universities throughout the country, providing the students who graduated from the Law career with transversal competencies to litigate, in the criminal jurisdiction cases about crimes of It hurts humanity."", 'TITLE: Repairing the social trauma of crimes against humanity in Chile: a Human Rights approach to the case of the Comprehensive Health Care and Reparation Programme La reparación del trauma social por crímenes de lesa humanidad en Chile: el caso del Programa de Reparación y Atención Integral de Salud analizado bajo el enfoque de derechos humanos | KEYWORDS: Human rights violations; Justice; Social Policy; State liability | ABSTRACT: Introduction. At the end of a period of conflict and repression, States must address past human rights violations by establishing a series of measures among which, reparations to victims. In Chile, after the 1973-1990 civic-military dictatorship, one of these measures was the implementation of the Programa de Reparación y Atención Integral de Salud (PRAIS) [the Comprehensive Health Care and Reparation Programme]. The programme has brought about a number of benefits and is currently an international benchmark for this type of policy. Yet the design of the programme presents a series of gaps that have made the reparation task difficult to fulfil. The objective of this work was to analyse the PRAIS programme, assessing its claim to be a reparation policy of social rehabilitation and its adaptation to the human rights approach. Methodology. A qualitative analysis was conducted by applying two strategies: on the one hand, the model of the reconstruction of the programme rationale and on the other, the human rights-based approach. The documentary analysis of the instruments establishing the reparation policy guidelines were used as a source of data. Results. Social trauma and the need for its reparation were identified as a problem, notably the health effects caused by impunity. However, no actions aimed at solving that problem were found. Regarding the orientation of the programme, a biomedical approach was adopted that focused on repairing biopsychosocial damage. Other relevant factors that contributed to the damage caused were not considered, among which impunity, which has a retraumatising effect. Regarding the programme design, there was no explicit relationship between the goals and the strategies developed to effectively solve the problem. Lastly, the programme does not fully guarantee a dignified treatment for the victims and their families, nor their right to take action for human rights violations. Furthermore, the programme does not present a coherent gender or intersectionality perspective either, nor does it allow meeting the criteria that guarantee the right to reparation. Discussion. Given the gaps in the programme, we can affirm that PRAIS has undergone improvisation over time across different governments. Its coordination with legal services has been omitted, and the action of social services has been minimised. At the same time, the programme has been incorporated into a pre-existing sectoral policy of a general nature. Conclusions. The programme rationale does not guarantee the fulfilment of its objectives nor its approach to social trauma. On the contrary, the fact of integrating the programme into a pre-existing policy and of failing to contemplate specific intersectoral actions has hindered effective rehabilitation. For these reasons, the programme seems to be favouring the re-victimisation of its target recipients instead.']"

This research holds a qualitative, nonexperimental, and cross-sectional design, utilising it the constant comparative method in an inductive order for collecting and analysing data. The purposive sample is integrated by two teachers specializing in music education who have a vast experience in primary schools. Results display that control of musical and pedagogical competencies are essential for solving teaching problems linked to the creation and implementation of music arrangements. In conclusion, three teaching factors have identified in milieus of primary education: teacher autonomy, lesson structure, and musical structure of the arrangement.', 'TITLE: Proposal of alternative principles for music education in a Latin American context Propuesta de principios alternativos para la educación musical en un contexto latinoamericano | KEYWORDS: Educational principles; Music education; Praxial philosophical approach; Predominant educational models | ABSTRACT: This article presents a proposal of alternative principles for music education in a Latin American context.

As Chile is considered one of the countries with the highest seismic activity and has experienced several of the most intense earthquakes on record in the world, this work seeks to identify behavioral changes in the birth rate within an affected population related to a natural disaster in Chile. Based on evidence from the 2010 Chilean earthquake, an empirical study was carried out drawing on birth rate data and social data associated with earthquakes in Chile between 2004 and 2015. Two models were estimated. The first model is a difference-in-differences model for determining the effect of the disaster on the birth rate in the affected area in the post-disaster period. The second model is a triple-difference model that includes the trend of the data over time. The results indicate a positive relationship between the variation in the birth rate and the occurrence of the natural disaster. Studying the relationship between disaster events and fertility contributes to understanding the phenomena of social dynamics. This knowledge could improve public policy decision making for better planning in the face of a natural disaster.', 'TITLE: The politics of disaster risk governance and neo-extractivism in latin america | KEYWORDS: Disaster risk creation; Disaster risk governance; Disaster risk reduction; Latin America; Natural resources; Neo-extractivism; Vulnerability | ABSTRACT: Latin America is one of the regions facing many disasters with some of the worse impacts. The current governance model has not proven successful in disaster risk reduction. This article aims to theoretically analyse the relationship between ideal regional disaster risk governance (DRG) and the actual production of disaster risk in Latin America. From the so-called ‘vulnerability paradigm’ and a regional standpoint, this analysis contributes to the debate with a specific focus on ‘neo-extractivism.’ Pointing mainly to sociopolitical processes triggered as of the early 2000s in Latin America, ‘neo-extractivism’ relates to a regional ecological-political pattern of intensive natural resource exploitation. The first part of this article presents a regional overview of DRG and its scope in disaster risk reduction, analysing its ineffectiveness through the lens of the neoliberal governmentality problem. The second part deals with the issue of ‘neo-extractivism’ to outline the actual links between the political arena, the development discourse, and the creation of vulnerability and new hazards in the region’s contemporary social processes. We show a correlation between political arrangements and environmental degradation that brings about both disasters and an increase in disaster risk. ‘Neo-extractivism’ foregrounds the political conditions for the implementation of regional DRG and reveals how its projections within the development discourse relate incongruously with the essential factors of disaster risk.', 'TITLE: Planning for exclusion: The politics of urban disaster governance | KEYWORDS: Chile; Disaster risk reduction; Land use planning; Post-disaster; Spatial injustice; Urban disaster; Urban governance | ABSTRACT: Many disaster risk reduction (DRR) initiatives, including land use planning, tend to ignore existing long-term inequalities in urban space. Furthermore, scholars working on urban disaster governance do not adequately consider how day-to-day DRR governing practices can (re)produce these. Hence, following a recent interest in the political dimensions of disaster governance, this article explores under what conditions the implementation of DRR land uses (re)produce spatial injustice on the ground. We develop a theoretical framework combining politics, disaster risk, and space, and apply it to a case study in Santiago, Chile. There, after a landslide disaster in the city’s foothills in 1993, a multi-level planning arrangement implemented a buffer zone along the bank of a ravine to protect this area from future disasters. This buffer zone, however, transformed a long-term established neighbourhood, splitting it into a formal and an informal area remaining to this day. Using qualitative data and spatial analysis, we describe the emergence, practices, and effects of this land use. While this spatial intervention has proactively protected the area, it has produced further urban exclusion and spatial deterioration, and reproduced disaster risks for the informal households within the buffer zone. We explain this as resulting from a governance arrangement that emerged from a depoliticised environment, enforcing rules unevenly, and lacking capacities and unclear responsibilities, all of which could render DRR initiatives to be both spatially unjust and ineffective. We conclude that sustainable and inclusive cities require paying more attention to the implementation practices of DRR initiatives and their relation to long-term inequities.']"

We highlight the role that cultural and symbolic 'products' (such as music, emotions, narratives, and visual symbols) play in the emergence and spread of populism. First, we explore the opportunities afforded by understanding the concept of populism from a cultural/symbolic point of view, reaching beyond the traditional party politics literature to which it is usually confined. Second, we suggest different ways in which populism has been articulated in various European countries (e.g. popular cultures, subcultures) since the economic crisis of 2008, emphasizing music, narratives, visuals, and emo-tions as means of the populist symbolic construction of the political and social reality. Third, from a social movement perspective, we reflect on the mechanisms (cognitive, emotional, normative) that may help understanding the current populist 'momentum', as well as on the methods to empirically grasp them."", ""TITLE: The nation of the people: An analysis of Podemos and Five Star Movement's discourse on the nation | KEYWORDS: left-wing nationalism; nationalism from below; patriotism; populism; Southern Europe | ABSTRACT: This article empirically explores how populist actors talk about the nation. This is a research area mostly tackled in studies on right-wing populism, with other forms of populist politics usually left out of the analysis. To fill this academic gap, we focus on the Spanish party Podemos and the Italian Five Star Movement (M5S). The former is a paradigmatic example of radical left populism, whereas the latter is commonly considered as a catch-all populist party with no clear ideological connotation. Through a discourse analysis on leaders' speeches and official public declarations, we focus on the role that national identity plays in the strategies of Podemos and M5S and on the type of nation they discursively construct. Whilst Podemos' populist strategy purposely aims at contending to the right ideologically loaded concepts and signifiers to construct an idea of nation fitting the party's leftist values, M5S's strategy mostly aims at appropriating valence issues, such as the “Made in Italy” brand and the concept of “national interest”. Thus, our analysis contributes to clarify the differences between the leftist political culture of Podemos and the “post-ideological” one of M5S, as also reflected by survey data confirming strong differences in “nationalist” attitudes between their respective electorates."", 'TITLE: PLAYING “ITALIANNESS” IN POPULAR MUSIC: National populism and music in contemporary Italy | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter discusses popular music and cultural practices as vectors for the articulation of populism in contemporary Italy. Drawing on the volume’s introduction, the authors explore the ways in which populist messages are socially diffused, legitimised, and popularised within Italy through popular music. More specifically, the chapter focuses on how popular music that contains populist elements is received by individual voters who constitute the potential electoral base for populist parties, as well as on the exploitation of popular music by populist politicians (from the syncretic Five Star Movement (M5S) to the right-wing League) keen to define their own political-cultural identity and appeal to specific demographics. The chapter concludes by highlighting how the contemporary Italian popular music repertoire often affords populist interpretations. However, transforming such populist affordances into an intentional adoption of populist worldviews requires a political elaboration that the authors only rarely detected in listeners. Whilst (nationalist-)populist political elaborations are often promoted by the right-wing League, the Five Star Movement generally avoids the use of popular music for political purposes: different party cultures account for these different strategies.']"
