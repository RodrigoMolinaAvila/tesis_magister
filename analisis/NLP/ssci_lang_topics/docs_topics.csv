0,5,"TITLE: Service Learning as a Teaching Strategy of Seismic Vulnerability during the COVID-19 Pandemic | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; learning experience; seismic vulnerability; service learning; STEM education; teaching strategy | ABSTRACT: COVID-19 has generated the largest disruption of the present century, forcing mankind to evaluate many paradigms. Educators have faced the challenge to develop teaching strategies suitable for distance learning, which is particularly complex for those engineering concepts where service learning is an effective approach. This paper presents a remote service based learning strategy, used to teach seismic vulnerability assessment to fourth-year Civil Engineering students at Universidad de La Sabana in Colombia. This strategy involved five stages and was adapted to be carried out remotely by students in their homes using a combination of several tools such as remote maps. The main activities were the seismic vulnerability assessment of the students' houses and the remote assessment of the building stock of Cajica, a municipality close to the University campus. The learning outcomes were assessed using evaluation rubrics. The results show that the proposed strategy is effective, as 100% of students scored at the top level of the rubric at the fifth stage. In addition, they indicate that service learning in a close context like the family generates motivation and commitment in students to their learning process. Overall, this experience demonstrated that service learning is an effective strategy for teaching engineering concepts in a remote environment. It also showed that although COVID-19 required the development of new teaching strategies, this did not become a limitation to fulfill the learning outcomes."

Given the pronounced gender disparities in math achievements in Chile, this study investigates these stereotypes within the Chilean context, examining their incidence and associated factors in two distinct age groups: adults and youth. Participants included adults (n = 5,038) and youth (n = 846) from the Encuesta Nacional de Percepción Social de la Ciencia, Tecnología, Conocimiento e Innovación study. Information on math-gender stereotypes, sociodemographics, and science perceptions were collected via participants’ reports. Logistic regression analyses using sampling weights were conducted in the two groups. Adults exhibited significantly higher levels of math-gender stereotypes compared to youth. Both groups shared factors associated with the probability of endorsing stereotypes (educational level, socioeconomic status, perception towards science). Conversely, sex emerged as a significant predictor for youth but not for adults. Findings suggest that math-gender stereotypes persist at different age groups in Chile, albeit with varying degrees. Socioeconomic disparities and the value towards science emerged as significant precursors across all groups."

Method: Using data from the Chilean ‘Encuesta Longitudinal de la Primera Infancia’ 2017 wave, the study involved 2959 children from 10 to 12 years of age. Both children’s and parents’ career expectations were measured through open questions. The assessment of the same children’s early skills was conducted in the 2012 wave when the children were from five to seven years of age, using the Battelle Developmental Inventory and the Backward Digit Span tests. Results: Findings revealed that boys, especially those with mothers with higher educational levels who have STEM expectations for their children, are more likely to expect to continue STEM careers in the future. A significant moderation effect was also found, indicating that parental expectations have a stronger association with girls’ and lower-middle SES children’s STEM career preferences. No significant results were observed for children’s early skills on later STEM career expectations. Conclusions: The study suggests that educational strategies involving family engagement are important for fostering equitable STEM career opportunities."
3,1,"TITLE: Gender and Psychological Variables as Key Factors in Mathematics Learning: A Study of Seventh Graders in Chile | KEYWORDS: Gender; learning; mathematics; motivation; self-concept | ABSTRACT: Chile is one of the countries with the largest gender gaps in high school mathematics achievement. Gender differences were studied examining the mathematics performance of 1,380 seventh grade students from 41 public schools, psychological variables related to achievement, and their perceptions of teachers’ support and expectations. Students’ self-reported attitudes and perceptions were assessed, as well as achievement at the beginning and end of the school year. Multivariate analysis of variance and co-variance, and multi-level regression analyses were performed. Significant differences were found favoring boys in mathematics achievement, motivation to learn mathematics, and math self-concept; and favoring girls regarding perceptions of teachers’ instructional support. Controlling for prior achievement, math self-concept and students’ perceptions of teacher expectations are significant predictors of mathematics achievement."
4,14,"TITLE: Copper demand forecasts and predictions of future scarcity | KEYWORDS: Backcasting; Copper; Demand model; Fixed stock; Reserves | ABSTRACT: Several studies dealt in the past decades with future predictions of the copper demand, motivated mainly by potential copper shortages that could arise due to insufficient reserves. It is known that there was never a shortage of reserves in order to satisfy demand in the last century and up to the present time. This paper addresses two questions. Did these concerns arise due to excessive demand forecasts, or due to stagnating reserves assumption, or due to both aspects? The article evaluates some of these predictions of future copper demand and compares forecasts with the real metal demand that materialized in past years. Also, it analyses the reserve assumptions of several studies and compares them with what really happened with copper reserves. In the case of recent forecast models that span into future years, whose copper demand is not known yet, a backcasting method was used in order to estimate forecasts, which consists of applying the model in the past. Five out of the seven models rerun in the original periods overestimated demand and two out of them considered that reserves were a fixed stock. Also, the two models studied by the backcasting method considered that reserves were a fixed stock. The four models that considered reserves as a fixed stock run out of reserves, irrespective of whether they overestimated or underestimated demand. These results suggest that predictions of a future scarcity of copper could be mainly attributed to the assumption of a fixed stock of reserves and not necessarily to overestimations of demand. The remaining five models did not consider the future availability of copper."
5,14,"TITLE: Evaluation of econometric models of secondary refined copper supply | KEYWORDS: Copper; Econometric model; Scrap; Secondary copper | ABSTRACT: Copper is essential in attaining a sustainable development path due to its prominent role in the electromobility and renewable energy industries. In 2019 refined copper usage was 23.5 million tons, of which primary copper supplied 86.3%, and the remaining 13.7% was provided by secondary metal. In the future, copper recycling would increase significantly concerning primary copper supply to meet the goal of decreasing greenhouse gases emissions. Secondary copper production reduces energy consumption by 85% and greenhouse gas emissions by 65% compared to average primary sources. This study analyzes seven econometric models described in the literature that tried to explain the supply of secondary refined copper worldwide (SRC). Furthermore, this study assesses the forecasting capacity of these models in the short and long-term. Although the explanatory variables selected by previous researchers are theoretically supported, they failed to fully explain SRC. An empirical analysis for the period 1960–2017 confirmed that only two of the eight studied explanatory variables shown to be causal of SRC in the short-term. The re-estimation of the coefficients shows high instability when the number of variables or observations changed, making it difficult to analyze the future market and to assess public policies. Although the explanatory variables share the same long-term trend (cointegrated series), they do not properly forecast the future when evaluated using the Backcasting methodology. Based on these results, it is possible to improve the explanatory and predictive power of the analyzed models and reduce their average error."
6,14,"TITLE: Potential copper production through 2035 in Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Copper production; Energy; GHG; Scenario 2035; Water | ABSTRACT: In the long term, primary and secondary supply of refined copper satisfies demand. Numerous models exist to explain and predict demand and secondary supply; however, the projection of primary supply relies mostly on detailed knowledge of potential mining projects and on existing ore reserves and resources. Much discussion has occurred historically regarding the availability of resources and reserves for the future. Chile, being the largest copper producer, also has the largest reserves in the world; therefore, it retains its potential to be a key player in future supply. This article explores some of the most relevant resource and technological challenges that may emerge with an accelerated development of brownfield and greenfield copper mining projects in Chile through 2035, without considering economic, regulatory, and environmental constraints. A “Full Scenario” was created to accommodate these conditions and restrictions. It includes estimates of future ore reserves, copper production, plant capacity, ore grades, energy and water consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and generation of tailings. Maximum production would exceed 10 million tons of contained copper from 2027 to 2030, with a resulting decrease of ore grades and the growth of energy and water consumption. The growth of indirect GHG emissions through 2035 is estimated at 18.4% less than copper production growth, because all new electric energy for this scenario would be based on renewable energy. Also, all new water used by 38 out of the 42 mining projects considered would be seawater, and some of the continental water used in 2019 would cease to be used in mining."
7,14,"TITLE: Attracting mining investments: the relationship between natural endowments and public policies | KEYWORDS: Competitiveness; Cross-country models; Exploration expenditures; Geologic potential; Index of economic freedom; Investment climate | ABSTRACT: Mining jurisdictions avid to attract international investments to find and exploit their mineral deposits contend for international capitals. This led to policymakers, analysts, and companies to think about the factors affecting the competitiveness of mining districts. The traditional paradigm states that the capacity of a country or jurisdiction to attract investments and develop its local industry is a function exclusively of the quantity and quality of the ore deposits within its territory. On the other hand, the alternative view suggests that the previous conception is incomplete, because companies not only look for a good geologic potential but also for a favorable investment climate (Tilton 1992). Through cross-country econometric models covering the years 1996 to 2014, this work supports the alternative paradigm of mining competitiveness and tries to contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between the geological potential and the investment climate when determining the attraction of mining investments. The study concludes that, in order to develop a local mining industry, a country should have a wealthy natural endowment, but also it must offer a good investment climate. In addition, it shows that both variables are related through a multiplicative effect, but once public policies and other contextual variables reach certain reasonable levels (the “investment climate threshold”), jurisdictions compete almost exclusively based on its natural endowment. These results have significant implications for the implementation of public policies, especially in periods when mining contribution to social welfare is under scrutiny."
8,-1,"TITLE: Direct economic return to government of public geoscience information investments in Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This article presents the first attempt to evaluate the direct economic return of the provision of public geoscience information in Chile. To achieve this goal the study uses multiplier effect ratios through the value chain of PGI and a probabilistic discounted cash flow model to evaluate the economic returns of different scenarios for the ongoing governmental program mandated to generate country-scale geological information, named the National Geological Program. The study shows that, in average, every dollar invested in PGI in Chile during the past three decades could have generated 11.5 dollars of government tax revenues from the mining industry (in terms of its NPV), with an IRR of around 21%. These results are in accordance with comparable studies abroad, but they should be taken carefully due to methodological restrictions of the study. These indicators are positive in almost all the scenarios considered in the study, despite that they show a wide range of results. Similar outcomes are obtained for the National Geological Program when different scenarios are evaluated."
9,14,"TITLE: Determinants of country competitiveness in attracting mining investments: An empirical analysis | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This study contributes to the debate on the competitiveness of countries to attract mining investments. The specific objectives of this work are: to bring empirical support to the alternative view of mining competitiveness, which highlights the key role of country's investment climate; and to propose a methodology, based on cross-country econometric models and the economic theory, to understand how the geological potential and the investment climate interact to define country's mining competitiveness. The research show that long-term mining competitiveness is not solely determined by the geological potential of countries. The models corroborate that both, geological potential and investment climate, are crucial to explain country's attractiveness. Moreover, the results suggest that the relationship of these two variables is not developed individually and additive, but through an interaction of both terms. Finally, the study identifies an “investment climate threshold area” in its final model. Mining competitiveness of countries with low investment climate depend on the interaction between their geological potential and investment climate. On the other hand, countries above this threshold compete for mining funds almost exclusively based on the mineral endowment of their territories. These findings could have relevant consequences in country's strategic decisions for the mining industry."
10,14,"TITLE: Good deposits are not enough: Mining labor productivity analysis in the copper industry in Chile and Peru 1992-2009 | KEYWORDS: Chile; Copper; Geological features; Labor productivity; Panel data; Peru; Production scale | ABSTRACT: Chile and Peru produce almost 45% of world's mine copper output. This situation reflects their natural endowment and mining tradition, but is also the result of development processes undertaken over the last decades. As a result, both countries multiplied its mine copper production in more than 3 times in the last 20 years. Mining labor productivity played a central role achieving these amazing growth rates. Although there is a consensus about the relevance of this variable for the mining industry, the specific factors behind labor productivity changes are not completely understood.In this paper we use a panel data approach to analyze labor productivity in the copper mining sector in Chile and Peru from 1992 to 2009. This technique is consistent with heterogeneity among mines and allows us to identify, describe and analyze all the different sources behind labor productivity changes.The result of the analysis shows that better deposits and operational factors are important, but not enough to explain labor productivity improvements in the copper mining industry, and instead, company specific efforts and wide industry changes, such as technology and management innovations, are as important as the evolution of the reserve base or geological features of the operations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."
11,14,"TITLE: Using exploration expenditures to assess the climate for mineral investment | KEYWORDS: Chile; Direct foreign investment; Mineral exploration; Mining | ABSTRACT: Countries that rely on private investors to find and exploit their mineral resources need reliable indicators of their investment attractiveness. This study explores the use of exploration expenditures for this purpose, focusing primarily on Chile. It finds that exploration expenditures can provide useful insights into both the level and trends in investment attractiveness for individual mineral producing countries. However, for various reasons, it is a country's share of grassroots exploration expenditures for specific metals, rather than its share of total world exploration, that most directly and immediately reflects investment climate. Over the current decade, Chile's shares of world grassroots exploration for gold and (more recently and more modestly) for base metals have fallen, suggesting a deterioration in the country's investment climate for these mineral commodities. The declines, however, are less dramatic than the country's falling share of total world exploration suggests. The study concludes by briefly examining the levels and trends in investment climate for the more important mining countries. Among other trends it finds that Canada and Australia continue to enjoy a high level of attractiveness despite the efforts of many developing countries in recent years to increase private investment in their mineral sectors. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

12,3,"TITLE: Spatial allocation of polling places considering urban mobility applied to Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: Mobility simulation; Polling stations; Santiago, Chile | ABSTRACT: A voting process allows the participation of citizens in the decision-making of a country. In Chile, the voting system is only face-to-face at polling places. The assignment historically did not consider the location (trip origins or residence) of voters, causing several mobility problems on election days. In 2022, the situation changed with the georeferencing of voters; therefore, an optimal allocation of polling places considering their initial location, the mobility of voters, and the supply of urban transportation is a critical factor. The research aims to propose a spatial allocation methodology for voters that considers the distance between voters and the closer polling place under a sustainable mobility approach. The optimization model of the location-allocation type analyzes the location of voters, the distance between polling places and voters, the capacity and number of polling places, and the public transport supply. The model is applied to San Miguel (commune) in Santiago, Chile, where the assignment of the electoral roll is modified based on the distance to the available and necessary polling places. The results are evaluated using transport modeling software, comparing the proposed scenarios with the current one. This methodology reduces travel times for voters by 59.83% and the traveled distance reduction from 4,000 to 1,800 meters with respect to the base scenario. A methodology such as the one proposed makes it possible to improve the tactical planning of voting processes regarding the supply of polling places, public transport supply, accessibility, and others."
13,3,"TITLE: Spatial analysis of public transportation infrastructure in Santiago, Chile, using the continuous approximation method | KEYWORDS: Chile; Concentric city; Continuous approximation; Network design; Santiago; Subway | ABSTRACT: Santiago, the capital city of Chile, has seven million inhabitants in an area of 850 km2. This city has a metro network with seven lines extending 140 kilometers and transports approximately 2.6 million people daily. The bus system has undergone significant transformations over the last three decades. The most relevant change having been Transantiago, the public transportation system implemented in 2007 for Santiago, Child, which combines the use of Metro and buses (BRT). Metropolitan Mobility Network (called Red) is the latest version of the public transportation plan. This paper aims to analyze the current subway infrastructure using the continuous approximation method for Santiago, Chile. We previously proposed a macroscopic methodology to identify the needs for an adequate level of service in urban mobility and transportation, and we applied it to Santiago's Metro network. Our work focuses on functionality and demand distribution. Santiago's demand varies spatially in volume and extension throughout the city. Using the latest origin-destination survey from 2012, we deduct the critical components in this current network structure. It is worth mentioning that the Metro design bases its network on a ring-radial structure. With our macroscopic model applied to Santiago, Chile, we have detected infrastructure needs in the current transit network. The supply of infrastructure should increase for two reasons: first, to achieve balanced cost levels between users and the agency and second, to reduce subway occupations. The optimal model outcomes for Santiago define the optimal network in which the system requires five rings and ten end-To-end longitudinal lines (20 radial routes), including lower levels of occupation. The obtained results are a good preliminary solution, considering the subway infrastructure supply could be sub-estimated in the public transportation plan."
14,3,"TITLE: Operational cost and user performance analysis of on-demand bus and taxi systems | KEYWORDS: bus services; demand-responsive transport; flexible routes; On-demand transit services; public transport; taxis | ABSTRACT: This paper presents the optimization problem of three different on-demand transit systems operated by vehicles of different sizes. This problem is aimed at minimizing the total cost of the system, which consists of the temporal cost experienced by users and the operating cost incurred by transit agencies. A compact set of estimations of the user performance and operating cost is provided, based on geometric probability. The optimization procedure allows the cost comparison of different semi-flexible services. Transit systems operated by cars (shared taxicabs) with flexible layouts are preferable for low demand densities (less than 92 pax/km2-h). For very high demand (higher than 200 pax/km2-h), bus systems with fixed layout and variable stop locations present the lowest total cost per passenger. In an intermediate domain, taxi and semi-flexible services compete among each other. The estimation of unit operating costs allows decision-makers to calculate the subsidies needed to make the system profitable."
15,3,"TITLE: Modeling public transportation networks for a circular city: The role of urban subcenters and mobility density | KEYWORDS: Continuous approximation method; Public transportation network design; Urban subcenter | ABSTRACT: The concentration of both employment and services in a specific area of a town generates positive effects, but also impacts (congestion, transit issues, and others). Urban subcenters seek to approach economic activities to residents in peripheral urban spaces. The objective of this research is to evaluate the contribution to the mobility of implementing urban subcenters in a city. The model has a total cost function (users and agency costs) on a circular city (ring and radial routes) formulated using the continuous approximation method. The model solution addresses with mathematical optimization. The model evaluates a BRT network applied to scenarios of urban subcenters. The results of the modeling show that the implementation of subcenters obtains savings of 3.5% in rush hour. Thus, this strategy of urban planning generates improvements in the functioning of a public transportation system. Moreover, the maximum benefits are obtained in medium-sized subcenters in comparison to the CBD, which allows balancing user and agency costs. Therefore, the outcomes may be better with an urban pattern with subcenters, and a transit scheme adapted to the demand needs."
16,3,"TITLE: Exploring paradigm shift impacts in urban mobility: Autonomous Vehicles and Smart Cities | KEYWORDS: autonomous car; continuous approximation; urban road network | ABSTRACT: Urban mobility is a dynamic system that has had a (slow) natural evolution. Scientists and engineers are currently developing new mobility technologies. A progressive paradigm shift will change everything from the fuel type to the way of driving vehicles. Vehicles will progressively become autonomous and will communicate and cooperate with each other. In the long run, profound changes are expected in mobility as a service. Furthermore, urban areas will have a higher level of development, and cities will likely turn into Smart Cities in which the vehicles will interact with the urban infrastructure. The main objective of this paper is to explore the macroscopic effects of mobility interaction in a radial-circular urban road system for current and future cities (Smart Cities). In the literature, there is documentation of the direct effects of autonomous vehicles, but some indirect effects will cause undesirable impacts such as an increase in demand and more congestion, which change the demand behavior and the urban structure. Finally, this paper exhibits the results of direct and indirect effects calculated through analytical tools (Continuous Approximation Method). In fact, our research shows that if demand increases by about 50%, the current scenario could have the same total cost as the future scenario with autonomous vehicles. Moreover, if the city radius increases by about 33% and the subjective value of time decreases about 20%, the benefits of the autonomous cars will be compensated. Therefore, the paper proves that autonomous vehicles could encourage the urban sprawl in the long run. Finally, Administrations should define transport strategies and policies to control these externalities, because autonomous driving could deteriorate mobility even worse than it is now."

The aim of this study was to analyze the dynamic and factors statistically associated with the expansion of tree plantations in two coastal basins in south-central Chile. We used logistic regression and a multimodel inference approach to assess the association of 13 location factors with tree plantation expansion in two periods (1987–2001; 2001–2015). The area of tree plantations increased by 292% and 196% in the Budi and Lingue basins, respectively. The presence of agriculture fields before conversion to tree plantations showed the greatest effect in both basins, followed by the suitability of the soil for forestry. Likewise, tree plantations were highly associated with the replacement of native vegetation, contributing to ongoing deforestation, and changes in forest policy increased the expansion in indigenous land."

This paper aims to explore how historical maps of land-use changes can be excellent tools for this purpose. The Lafkenmapu area in Chile, which has undergone critical socio-cultural transformations over the last five centuries, served as a case study. A total of five historical periods were described and translated into land-use change maps (pre-Hispanic; colonial; post-colonial; state consolidation; present). Non-cartographic (e.g. historical chronicles and publications) and cartographic sources (historical maps, aerial photography and satellite images) were integrated for each period to create a timeline map. Finally, some concluding remarks discuss the added value of the maps as a tool for a better understanding of the impact of socio-cultural transformations on land use and population distribution."
19,0,"TITLE: Mapuche-Pewenche knowledge transmitted by teachers and parents: perception of schoolchildren in rural schools of the Araucanía region (Chile) | KEYWORDS: indigenous language; intercultural education; knowledge; Mapuche-pewenche; rural schools | ABSTRACT: In Chile, two public policies focusing on teaching-learning among primary school children have been implemented to contribute to the development of the language and culture of indigenous peoples and to the formation of intercultural citizens: 1) the Bilingual Intercultural Education Programme (PEIB); and 2) the Indigenous Language Sector (SLI). The present study assessed perception of Mapuche knowledge among schoolchildren in schools located in the Mapuche-Pewenche territory of the Araucanía Region. The methodology used for data collection was analytical-observational with a Likert-type questionnaire, applied to children in schools registered and not registered for these policies. The statements had two dimensions: the roles assumed in the transmission of knowledge by these public policies and by families respectively. The results showed that the children belonging to schools registered for these policies, expressed disagreement with most of the statements concerning the transmission of that knowledge; while the children in schools not registered for the policies considered that there was indeed transmission of knowledge. The latter result was related to the loss of valuation of this knowledge by these children. In both cases, the children recognised that knowledge is transmitted fundamentally within the family."

This study proposes to prioritize territories for educational management of mathematics through spatial and temporal assessment of results in the Sistema Nacional de Calidad de la Educación (simce) test applied to children in 4th grade primary education during the period 1999-2011. This research suggests that there are more groups of territories than can be associated with the three levels of achievement traditionally used in Chile and that educational management should be applied at census district scale, considering differentiated policies for the different groups prioritized."

For this purpose, a survey was applied to 53 individuals (10% of households), which addressed five themes: (1) use of native forests, (2) participation in social networks and access to information, (3) general knowledge about the law, and (4) knowledge regarding the administration, and (5) promotion of the Law. The results showed that: (1) native forests used for wood and non wood products, (2) networks social and especially radio are essential for the transfer of information, (3) both the general knowledge of the law, as (4) the level of knowledge regarding the administration of the Law is insufficient, and (5) procedures are not known to be made to obtain the benefits of the Law. We concluded that: (1) the level of knowledge of the law is insufficient, (2) is essential to encourage the use of the instruments of this Law in the entire territory, so as to ensure sustainable resource use, and (3) the dissemination of the benefits of the Law must consider traditional forms of communication, level of education and culture of rural areas."

In pharmacy programs, lack of academic integrity reaches up to 90%, with socioeconomic, personal, and academic reasons being among the main factors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the factors that influence academic integrity of Chemistry and Pharmacy students at the Universidad Católica del Norte. Methods: Descriptive cross - sectional study, which included Pharmacy students, to whom a survey of 31 statements with responses on a Likert-type scale was applied, which allowed us to collect the factors that influence academic integrity. Results: Out of a total of 113 students, 60.2% were female, average age of 23.1 ± 3.2 years, and 16 (14.1%) corresponded to the 2020-2021 cohorts. The main motivations to commit dishonest acts perceived by the students were “socioeconomic, socio-cultural and family” reasons as well as “personal characteristics”, such as the fear of losing scholarships, failing a course and fear of career failure. The comparison between 2020-2021 cohorts and the rest of the generations showed significant differences in the “socioeconomic, sociocultural and family” grouped perceptions category (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Recognizing the causes of academic dishonesty allows us to implement preventive strategies that focus towards the development of an academic integrity based culture and attitudinal skills of self-efficacy in the student body, which contribute to an ethical professional training and performance."

There are no articles available in Chile to address academic integrity. The aim of this Study is to assess the perception on the conducts that relate to academic integrity of pharmacist students of the Universidad Católica del Norte, Chile. Method: A quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional and non-probabilistic study for convenience sample, in which an email and social network distributed expert peers aproved survey was conducted, including 11 written simulations showing dishonest conducts; students were required to recognize in every situation the person accountable of misconduct and to point out if they had witnessed these conducts during their college career. Results: Out of a total of 126 students, 60% where female, average age of 22.9 ± 3.2 years and 21 (16.7%) belonged to the 2020-2021 cohort. 98.8% of the students recognized plagiarism in the written simulation scenarios; the least recognized conduct was concealment (58.7%; p < 0.0001). 90% of the students indicated that they had witnessed at least one situation involving concealment or deceit during their college career. Comparison between 2020-2021 cohort and the rest of the cohorts showed no statistically significant differences neither in a concealment situation (p = 0.115) nor in a collusion situation (p = 0.186). Conclusion: To promote ethical training, preventive strategies must be implemented; such strategies will allow the student body to detect dishonest attitudes and behaviors within a college environment, which will have a positive impact on their vocational training."
25,-1,"TITLE: Wallmapu-Araucanía in flames! An historical political ecology of fire in the domination of southern Chile | KEYWORDS: Colonialism; Fire; Historical political ecology; Landscapes of power; Resistance; Wallmapu-Araucanía | ABSTRACT: The conflict over Wallmapu-Araucanía in southern Chile, between the Spanish conquistadores, the Chilean state and the Mapuche peoples, dates from the 16th century, with a key moment being the forced integration of Mapuche land into the Chilean state in the late nineteenth century. This paper discusses this long period of conflict in three moments: conquest, occupation and liberation, and it focuses on the use of fire as a politico-symbolic and techno-productive tool. A ‘landscapes of power framework’ is used for this historical political ecology analysis, based on texts from the nineteenth century to the present. The conclusions point to the historical importance of the use of fire as a tool not only for physical changes in the landscape, but principally as a tool of political symbolism that relates to a history of conflict of terror and displacement, used by the forces of occupation and resistance."

Due to the limited housing options the State provides, these settlements have historically developed forms of organization and struggle in search of their right to the city. Essentially, these actions focus on self-management to obtain a place to live. However, despite sharing similar needs, these groups show diverse forms of struggle. In the current context, with a growing demand for housing in the country, various strategies these groups adopt to integrate into the city can be observed. This article focuses on analyzing the occupation and spatial governance strategies implemented in two encampments located in the city of Temuco, Chile: Los Pinos and Los Ripieros, through a qualitative approach based on the application of a social mapping to the leaders of both settlements and the exploration of narratives related to past and future spatial governance. Differences were identified between these two encampments. Although they share a contiguous physical location and emerged at the same time, the results reveal that, despite initial similarities in urban development, there are differences in the motivations guiding their future actions. While Los Ripieros actively seeks to influence obtaining a permanent housing solution in other sectors of the city, Los Pinos chooses to get involved within the framework of existing urban regulations to secure a housing solution in the same place. These findings enrich the discussion on urban marginality by showing that the struggles for space of excluded groups are centered on the balance between rootedness and obtaining housing. The latter is vital for the state to consider when designing urban policies."

Departing from the identification of a common agent-fire-, it applies content analyses approach over documentary sources associated to occupational historical processes, identifying four key dimensions that make it possible to understand fire’s role into the transformation of spatial processes. The main findings indicate that fire is constantly connected to deterritorialization and reterritorialization processes, being part of the inhabitant’s practices as well as a tool for territorial power and control."

This article analyzes the power relations of the agents (Vinos de Chile, Coalición Nacional de Viñateros, and public institutions) involved in the wine development of these areas, throughout the analysis and interpretation of discourses and narratives linked to language. One of the most relevant findings is the relationship of “inclusive exclu-sion” produced by the condition of domination and dependency of small and medium producers on the great industry."

Once the land was usurped from the Mapuche people, fertile valleys and dense forests were replaced by wheat cultivation until the early twentieth century. This article explores the ‘invention’ of so-called ‘Green Gold’ forest landscape in this region, using historical political ecology and a ‘landscapes of power’ framework. Based on the analysis and interpretation of historical sources, including cartography, photography and texts, we reconstruct the historical trajectory of this landscape, emphasizing the role of science, the enactment of laws, the creation of new institutions and the influence of international organizations. These influences paved the way for large forestry firms to emerge, primarily under dictatorship (1973-1989), which in turn generated an unprecedented plantation forestry ‘boom’ that transformed the regional landscape. The conclusions highlight the importance of shifting from a neutral concept of territorial attributes to the invention of landscapes, as a social construction based on power relations that lead to domination and exclusion."

The Chilean state, supported by agrarian, political and intellectual elites enabled the extraction of natural resources which led to the construction of a new ‘Chilean wheat bowl’ landscape of power, installed on the old Mapuche frontier. This article deconstructs and interprets historical sources within a framework based on historical political ecology and landscapes of power. It traces the hegemonic imposition of this landscape via devices that ensured coercion or enabled consent, with a view to imposing a particular landscape in this territory. The conclusions point to the importance of historical context for explaining contemporary socio-ecological configurations of landcapes, since this context reveals the influence of power relations and political, economic and cultural factors in the social construction of territories, and the elimination of other landscapes."

The logics under which the real estate market and other different agents operate, together with the flexibility of urban planning instruments that regulate the territory, means urban space environments are permanently changing. Temuco, one of the most important intermediate cities in Chile in terms of population numbers, operates under the same logics. However, unlike other Chilean cities, the presence of Indigenous Territory Protection Areas (APTI) associated with Mapuche communities, establishes legal barriers that impede the conventional growth of the city. Likewise, it is possible to see how in recent decades these lands have been permeable to different uses, outside the dimensions supposedly protected by law. This work explores the discourses of Mapuche peri-urban landowners regarding the changes that these areas have recently undergone as a result of the city's expansion. To do this, 20 interviews were conducted with Mapuche landowners from peri-urban areas around Labranza, an urban area of Temuco, which were analyzed under the parameters of the Grounded Theory. Among the results obtained, the following stand out: Pressure strategies on this land from different private agents, the loss of ancestral sense of the land by some Mapuche communities that end up selling under different legal loopholes, and the resistance to external interference that still persists in many of them. The latter shows that there are Mapuche resistance strategies not only in territories affected by forestry intervention, but also in those spaces under stress from the rapid growth of cities."
32,-1,"TITLE: A “landscapes of power” framework for historical political ecology: The production of cultural hegemony in Araucanía-Wallmapu | KEYWORDS: Araucanía-Wallmapu; Chile; cultural hegemony; historical political ecology; landscapes of power framework | ABSTRACT: The region of Araucania, since its incorporation into the Republic of Chile, has been subject to significant territorial transformations. The Chilean State, supported by economic elites, the political class, and intellectuals have all contributed to the discursive positioning of, and the creation of artefacts in, this regional space. These devices for mobilising power have enabled an appropriation of nature – through natural resource exploitation – and an appropriation of land rights through property titles. The occupation of Araucania from the end of the 19th century was achieved principally through the artefacts of larger settlement consolidation, the railway network, and the building of roads. These were designed and imposed from Santiago through political and administrative channels based on an internal colonialism logic. Conflicts with indigenous Mapuche in Wallmapu (the Mapudungun name for their territory) arose as a consequence of asymmetries of power and this appropriation of space, including expulsion from their land, deforestation, increasing poverty due to restricted access to traditional resources, and epistemic violence through specific constructions of development and the subalterning of indigenous “others.” This historical political ecology not only reveals the expanding frontiers of extractivism and processes of accumulation in favour of national political and economic elites, but more importantly shows how the construction of cultural landscapes became a device for exercising power and justifying appropriation in pursuit of modernity, progress, and development. These landscapes of power evolved over time as different demands were placed on this territory: first as a wheat bowl, and second as forestry plantation. A “landscapes of power” framework is presented in order to work through these constructions of landscape, building on phenomenological and dwelling perspectives in order to focus on the role of cultural hegemony and power relations."

Background for conservation and territorial management Morfología y dinámica dunaria en el borde costero de la región de la araucanía en chile. Antecedentes para la conservación y gestión territoria | KEYWORDS: Degree of stabilization; Dune dynamics; Territorial management | ABSTRACT: An evaluation was made of the dynamics of the dune systems of the coastal strip of the Araucanía region between 1994 and 2004, based on its morphological classification and degree of stabilization as evaluated from cartographic material, aerial photographs and investigation in the field. Eight fields of dunes were defined with a total surface area of 4,597 ha being stated a total expansion of 314 ha in the period; active dunes represented 35% of the total area, while semi-stabilized and stabilized dunes represented 31% and 15% respectively. The most common type of morphology was transverse dunes and the most frequent plant species were Pinus radiata and Ammophila arenaria. Finally, the localization and the determination of the stabilization grades and dunaries shapes allow to recognize the action of the natural and anthropic factors, these integrally require to be tackle as a frame for an integrated management of this coastal zone."

Families with children with FXS who sought care at our centre (CDTSXF) answered a survey to evaluate parent satisfaction. We analyzed adherence to management and the costs of CDTSXF operation. The percentage of parents satisfied with CDTSXF management ranged from 38% for speech development, to 100% for general management. The financial costs covered 70% of economic costs of centre operation. Patient adherence was associated with the age at admission to CDTSXF. Low satisfaction with language development could be attributed to low treatment adherence. The CDTSXF should study different mechanisms of financing its operation, estimate the cost of FXS for families, and improve treatment adherence among older patients."

In so doing, it analyzes the political subjectivities of social organizations from Valparaíso, Chile, in recent years. Based on the content analysis of interviews and field notes, we note the emergence of a political-territorial aesthetic that challenges the neoliberal sensitive order. This new aesthetic is characterized by: a) disruptive sensitive experiences oriented toward the political struggle for dignified life that make a diversified appropriation of the city; b) the recomposition of socio-spatial links through solidarity and social organization mediated by territorial associativity; and c) the re-emergence of the paradox of political representativity that reinforces the unequal distribution of the sensitive within cities. We conclude by arguing that the sensorial regime of control limits these new aesthetic forms."

In this scenario, this research aims at understanding the relationship between the reconfiguration of political subjectivities and territorial articulation dynamics. In so doing, it analyses the discourse of 56 social leaders from Valparaíso, Chile. The analysis shows that organizations' territorial articulation dynamics are linked to their political subjectivities reconfiguration, and they activate material, symbolic and affective mediations. The article concludes by reflecting on how the building of a new political subject forms part of a struggle for hegemony oriented to the need to surpass neoliberal political subjectivity."

While critics have highlighted the bias and 'unintended consequences' of these instruments, it is not at all clear how these indexes are changing the ways in which research takes place. In this paper, we discuss the opportunities and problems facing scientific journals within this environment. By means of 12 qualitative interviews with editors-in-chief of WoS-indexed journals edited in Chile, we analyse the editors' perceptions and strategies to surf within this environment. The article highlights the current tensions that indexation brings for the journals and some strategies to cope with them, the negotiation processes with their traditional audiences, and the conflicts that emerge in the current internationalization processes led by international scientific indexes. Finally, the paper concludes by reflecting on the possibilities and pitfalls that index-led internationalization has for journals, especially in so-called semi-peripheral communities."

However, very little is hitherto known about the effects of these processes on specific situated communities. Through a multi-method approach (bibliometrics and interviews), we provide a nuanced description of these effects on the becoming of university-based sociology in Valparaíso, Chile, during the last fifteen or so years. The paper pays special attention to the emergence of a particular form of internationalization based on international indexes and rankings that has gained influence on the day-to-day practices of the scholarly communities in that part of the scholarly (semi-)periphery. We thoroughly described the entanglements of individual trajectories and institutional framings in the practices and discourses of sociologists in Valparaíso. The article concludes by highlighting the tensions arising from the encounter of traditions and some trade-offs of the current form of internationalization for (semi-)peripheral communities."

Changes in publication and citation practices in Chile, 1976–2015 | KEYWORDS: Chile; citations; internationalization imperatives; publications; scientific communities | ABSTRACT: Internationalization pressures are omnipresent in the world of science. Scholars and administrators now often make use of international impact as a yardstick by which to assess the quality of national scholarship. However, little is hitherto known about the effects of the internationalization incentives at the level of specific national scientific communities. This article presents an analysis of the forms of internationalization in Chile over a period of four decades, from 1976 to 2015. Using Web of Science data, the article looks at the evolution for both publications and citations and examines the internationalization pressures on Chilean scholars and Chilean journals in relation to changes at the level of publication language and co-authorship. The article particularly focuses on the differences between the three cultures (humanities, natural sciences and social sciences). Building on the findings, the article concludes with some suggestions for research policy."
42,0,"TITLE: The Image of Ethnography—Making Sense of the Social Through Images: A Structured Method | KEYWORDS: constructivist GT; ethnography; interpretive description; methods in qualitative inquiry; photo elicitation | ABSTRACT: Although systematic observation and interviews are the most common techniques in ethnography, a deep understanding requires research tools adapted to exploring beyond the observational scope. Nonconventional methods can support ethnography and complement observations and thus refine the construction of meaning. Qualitative research literature deals disproportionately more with some forms of data, typically text, lacking a structured method for visuals. This article arises from a case study using nonconventional methods, such as sociograms and participant-made drawings, and presents a structured method to attain enriched ethnographic analysis. Using this structured method, the research then draws on representation, visualization, and interaction as ports of entry into group dynamics. The aim being to open a way to discovery when visual and interactional representations do not easily translate into words. Spoken language presupposes an ability to capture and convey thought with precision and clarity and to know how the interlocutor may interpret words. A structured method to analyze images can fruitfully assist in the process. Since every research participant has a view on or a way of making sense of the research subject, the method is universal in application."
43,0,"TITLE: Understanding the prospect of success in professional training: an ethnography into the assessment of problem-based learning | KEYWORDS: adult learning; ethnography; expectancy theory; group dynamics; Higher education; problem-based learning | ABSTRACT: One of the most fundamental innovations in higher education is the introduction of the method known as problem-based learning (PBL). While literature has largely focused on its learning goals and the transition from lectures to tutorials, little research has problematised why this is a successful methodology and what we consider as students’ success. Drawing upon various ethnographic techniques, the authors analyse PBL as a field of expectations in light of Expectation-Value Theory. Beyond merely showing that PBL is a culturally constructed practice, the article elaborates on how students’ expectations inform practices, performance and evaluation, which is important for assessing the successfulness of the method. By discussing students’ expectations, dynamics and power relations, the present article is a contribution to the research addressing what has come to be known as the ‘black box’ of PBL."

A sample of 1234 students was considered simulating the application process to enter higher education. Through a simulated application, participants were asked to both evaluate the education they received and make choices on the prospective training they would seek at university level. With this we aimed at gaining insight into disciplinary openness and flexibility. The results were organized into five groups obtained through cluster analysis. Among these, clusters associated to disciplinary flexibility overcome the classic binary decision/indecision understanding of career choice. Therefore, it is concluded that the problem of career choice may not be intrinsic to students and their decisional process, but rather to a limited offer of study programs. This highlights new challenges for curriculum planning in higher education."

The study included the construction of indicators of disciplinary mobility and interactivity of students, which allowed us to discuss interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity at the university. In general terms, the outcome of the study revealed the significant rigidity and practical restrictions of flexible curriculum, conditions that limit the emergence of denser communication schemes and more interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity in higher education."

It uses a multiple-method strategy that includes participant observation, personal interviews, and content analysis of three major newspapers during the period 2003-8. The theoretical approach emphasizes time and space coordinates of specified social actors, sociocultural emergence, a limited range of dominant emotions, and dramaturgy to describe the complexity of ritualized commemorations. It shows that incidents occurring on this date are not primarily caused by the actions of social movement organizations. Moreover, the dichotomy of ""day and night"" used to understand the peaceful and violent commemorations is an oversimplification of a complex network of events, actors, and scenarios that has the effect of denying any legitimacy to actions that fall outside the state-approved practices. © 2013 University of Miami."

Samples comprised 268 participants for Study 1, and 160 for Study 2, who were cisgender, transgender, or nonbinary. All participants answered an online questionnaire with sociodemographic questions, a perceived social support scale, and a list of individuals to whom they disclosed their sexual orientation. In both studies, the predictors of sexual orientation disclosure were being gay or lesbian (vs. bisexual and other sexual minority individuals), not living with parents, and perceiving social support from others outside family and friends. Our findings show the need to expand the social understanding of sexual orientation beyond heterosexual-homosexual dichotomies, and to strengthen sources of social support in higher education to foster safer environments for sexual and gender minority students."

However, data on the extent to which workplace and family support, family-to-work conflict, and family satisfaction were linked during the COVID-19 pandemic for workers and their families is still limited. This study explored the actor and partner effects between perceived workplace support for families and perceived family support, family-to-work conflict, and family satisfaction, in different-sex dual-earner parents with adolescents and the mediating role of parents’ family-to-work conflict. In the Metropolitan Region of Chile, 430 dual-earner parents and their adolescent child (mean age of 12.8 years, 53.7% female) were recruited for the study. Mothers and fathers responded to measures of family-to-work conflict and perceived workplace support for families and the Perceived Family Support Scale. The three family members answered the Satisfaction with Family Life Scale. Analyses were conducted using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model and structural equation modeling. Results showed that mothers’ and fathers’ perceived workplace support for families and perceived family support helped reduce their family-to-work conflict; no other association involving parents’ perceived workplace support for families was significant. By contrast, direct actor and partner effects were found between parents’ perceived family support and the three family members’ family satisfaction. Family-to-work conflict showed two significant mediating roles: One intraindividual in fathers and one intraindividual from fathers to adolescents. These findings indicate that resources both parents gain from perceived family support positively affect the three family members’ family satisfaction by different mechanisms and underscore the importance of family support for family satisfaction during the pandemic."

In this population, adherence to heter-onormativity may increase a sense of discrepancy between the “current” and the “ought” self. This self-discrepancy, in turn, has a negative impact on life satisfaction. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between two dimensions of heteronormativity –gen-der essentialism and normative behaviours– and life satisfaction, both directly and mediated by self-discrepancy. Method: A sample of 232 LGB university students in Southern Chile an-swered an online questionnaire that included the Heteronormative Attitudes and Beliefs Scale, the Self-Discrepancy Index, and the Life Satisfaction Scale. Structural equation models were performed to test these relationships. Results: Gender essentialism and normative behaviour were negatively and positively associated with life satisfaction, respectively. Likewise, self-discrepancy was negatively linked to life satisfaction. The analysis showed no evidence for the mediating role of self-discrepancy in this model. Conclusion: LGB university students can adhere to different dimensions of heteronormativity, which in turn may relate differentially to life satisfaction."

Method: The sample comprised of 110 students divided into an experimental (n = 68) and a control (n = 42) group. Pre-and post-inter-vention measurements were considered, within the framework of a pilot financial education programme for students of Pedagogy of History and Geography. Analyses included Multilevel Mixed Effects Analyses, which evaluated the predicting power of attitudes towards purchasing, materialism, self-discrepancy and levels of financial literacy regarding behavioural change in responsible consumption. Results: The results set forth rationality (a subscale of attitudes toward purchasing), and centrality (a subscale of materialism) as significant predictors of behavioural changes in purchasing. Conclusions: These results suggest guidelines for interventions to promote responsible consumption in university students."

The questionnaire included the following scales: Family Resources scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Satisfaction with Food-related Life and Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS). Using factor analysis, two dimensions were detected on the Family Resources scale: intangible resources (Cronbach’s α = 0.886) and tangible resources (Cronbach’s α = 0.824). A cluster analysis applied to the Z-scores from the factor analysis classified three typologies: students with high support in tangible resources, satisfied with their life and their food-related life (18.2 %), students with low support from their families, moderately satisfied with their life and their food-related life (20.7 %), and students with support in intangible and tangible resources, satisfied with their life and their food-related life (61.1 %), who scored significantly higher on the SHS. The typologies differed in the place of residence during the period of studies, socioeconomic level, need to work while studying, frequency and time available for having lunch in the place of residence, and body mass index. The family support students receive as tangible or economic resources is positively related to life satisfaction and to the domain of food, whereas family support in intangible or social resources is related to happiness."

The questionnaire included the SWLS (Satisfaction with Life Scale) and SWFL (Satisfaction with Food-related Life) scales, life-styles, food, and sociodemographic characteristics. Multinomial logit and probit models were proposed, in which the dependent variable was satisfaction with life. Both models proved significant (P < 0.01), but the logit model provided a better explanation of the construct. The results indicate a significant relation between satisfaction with life on the one hand and access to means of satisfying the basic needs associated with the concept of quality of life and maintenance of identity on the other. The probability of a high degree of satisfaction with life in a Mapuche person rises if he (she) possesses a greater number of goods, lives in the country, has higher education, has a partner, spends more than Ch $100,000 (US $200) per month on food, frequently consumes Mapuche food, leads an orderly life and is satisfied with his food.

Considering the increase in food imports into Chile, a personal survey was carried out of 400 mapuche and 400 non mapuche persons to determine the importance of the country of origin in the purchase decision for beef in people of different ethnic groups in the La Araucanía and Metropolitan Regions (Chile). Conjoint analysis revealed that country of origin was slightly less important than price (44.4% and 55.6%), with no signifcant differences by ethnic group, but a possible regional ethno-centrist effect was detected. Using analysis of hierarchical conglomerates, two principal consumer profles were distinguished: the majority group (62.5%) assigned greater importance to the price, while the second group (28.1%) assigned greater importance to the origin. The segments presented differences by region of residence, socio-economic group and person who purchases the food. Thus from the results of this research it may be concluded that the importance of the country of origin as an attribute in the purchase decision process for beef is not associated with the ethnic origin of the consumer, considering the principal indigenous people in Chile, the Mapuche, but it is associated with the region of residence."

Additionally, we explored the associations of attachment insecurity and demographic factors (sex assigned at birth, sexual orientation, educational level, and relationship status) with the likelihood of belonging to each profile. A sample of 1,925 emerging adults completed self-report measures assessing negative (depressive, anxiety, stress, and psychosomatic symptoms) and positive (subjective and psychological well-being) mental health indicators. Latent profile analysis revealed five distinct mental health profiles that partially aligned with the DFMM configuration. Three profiles corresponded to the DFMM categories of vulnerable, symptomatic but content, and troubled mental health. However, instead of a single favorable mental health profile, two profiles emerged: complete mental health and well-adapted, which together accounted for 70% of the sample. Higher levels of attachment insecurity, being woman, identifying as nonheterosexual, and lower educational attainment were associated with an increased likelihood of belonging to less favorable mental health profiles. These findings support the DFMM over traditional approaches and offer valuable insights to inform the development of tailored support services that address the unique needs of emerging adults."
57,18,"TITLE: The negative effects of internalized homonegativity on sexual satisfaction: dyadic effects and gender-based differences in Chile | KEYWORDS: Internalized homonegativity; internalized homophobia; minority stress; positive sexuality; same-sex couples | ABSTRACT: Heterosexism is not only expressed through sexual prejudice as an external stressor, but also as an internalized rejection toward one’s own (and others’) sexually diverse identity. That is, lesbian women and gay men themselves internalize negative societal attitudes toward their sexual orientation and identity—a phenomenon called internalized homonegativity. A wealth of research shows that internalized homonegativity negatively affects the health and social adjustment of gay and lesbian people. However, the literature has documented this trend from an individual (over a dyadic) perspective, and largely among gay (over lesbian) samples. To address this oversight, we analyzed data from 210 gay and lesbian couples in Chile to examine both actor and partner effects of internalized homonegativity on their sexual satisfaction. Results from moderation analyses from an actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) approach show that partners’ internalized homonegativity negatively affects actor sexual satisfaction, a pattern significantly moderated by gender; that is, only observed among lesbian couples. Our results further demonstrated that these effects hold above and beyond the actor and partner effects of age and relationship satisfaction, as well as relationship length. These results are consistent with the broader literature, which discusses the specific features of internalized homonegativity in lesbian women, characterized—among other aspects—by restrictive social demands over their sexuality. Accordingly, our findings highlight the deleterious relational consequences of internalized homonegativity and offer a relevant empirical contribution to the understanding of specific minority stress dynamics among lesbian women."

This study evaluated the mediational role of connectedness with the gay men’s and lesbian women’s community on the relationship between two minority stressors (internalized homophobia and perceived sexual stigma) with anxiety-depressive symptomatology and life satisfaction. The sample consisted of 467 Chilean self-identified as gay men (57%) and lesbian women (43%). Results revealed that the two minority stressors were associated with anxiety-depressive symptomatology, but only internalized homophobia was associated with life satisfaction. The mediation hypothesis was partially supported by the relationship between internalized homophobia and life satisfaction. Unexpectedly, we found a negative association between connectedness with the gay men’s and lesbian women’s community and life satisfaction. This finding introduces a view that contrasts with the literature, which proposes that connectedness with the specific community would be a protective factor against sexual stigma."
59,18,"TITLE: Romantic Attachment and Relationship Satisfaction in Gay Men and Lesbians in Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Attachment theory has proven to be a solid framework for understanding couple bonds, but research focused on same-sex relationships among gay men and lesbian women from Latin America remains limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between romantic attachment and relationship satisfaction in a sample of Chilean gay men and lesbian women. A snowball sampling was used. The final sample consisted of 259 individuals involved in a same-sex couple relationship, ranging from 18 to 66 years of age (M = 27.2, SD = 6.8) for gay men and 18 to 57 years of age (M = 28.6, SD = 8.1) for lesbian women. Our hypotheses were partially supported, as there was a negative association between attachment avoidance and relationship satisfaction, but not between attachment anxiety and relationship satisfaction. We did not find a gender moderating effect. These findings may contribute to the understanding of lesbian and gay people in a same-sex couples relationship from an attachment theory perspective."
60,18,"TITLE: Determinants of heterosexual men's attitudes toward gay men and lesbians in Chile | KEYWORDS: Authoritarianism; conventionalism; gay men; gender role; lesbians | ABSTRACT: We studied the effects of different sets of sociopolitical variables on attitudes toward gay men and lesbians in a Chilean sample of heterosexual men (n = 121). Based on these data, a hierarchical linear regression was performed, with the dependent variable being attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. Results reveal the importance of two variables, authoritarian aggression and gender role beliefs, which are relevant for both gay men (β =.27 and β =.44, respectively) and lesbian (β =.30 and β =.36, respectively) assessment. The only difference in the assessment of both groups is that conventionalism (β =.22) is relevant for evaluating gay men, while for lesbians the relevant variable is authoritarian submission (β =.22). These results are important because they indicate that heterosexual men make a differential assessment on the basis of two variables: adhesion to dominant values (being a fundamental dimension in the case of gay men) and degree of submission or attachment to an alleged legitimate authority which ends up in keeping them in an inferior condition (fundamental in the case of lesbians). When these values and social hierarchy are questioned, the level of negative attitudes may be more evident."

The sample was recruited through a snowball procedure in Chile (Santiago, Valparaíso, and Arica). Data obtained are compared to those from a group of men who have sex with men (MSM; n = 323). Results reveal statistically significant differences in the levels of happiness (t(157) = 2.16; p = .03; d = .25), satisfaction with life (t(154) = 3.90; p < .001; d = .47), and purpose in life (scale of psychological wellbeing; t(151) = 1.99; p.04; d = .24) reported by the two groups. The transwomen group shows the lowest scores in all dimensions. However, trans women report higher levels of social coherence (t(432) = −4.96; p < .001; d = .53) on the social wellbeing scale, compared to the MSM group. Regarding their levels of clinical symptomatology, trans women report higher levels of anxiety (t(163) = −6.67; p < .001; d = .78), depression (t(167) = −5.61; p < .001; d = .65), somatization (t(161) = −5.10; p < .001; d = .60), hostility (t(153) = −5.38; p < .001; d = .62), and phobic anxiety (t(164) = −6.70; p < .001; d = .80). Results are discussed on the basis of the context of each group."

In addition, we set out to validate this scale using the Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men (ATLG) Scale Cardenas and Barrientos (The Journal of Sex Research 45(2):140-149, 2008a). Finally, we divided our sample into categories with a view to creating a typology (Egalitarian, Normative opponents, Bigots, and Individual opponents). No research to date has confirmed the hypothesized factor structure of the BCASSFS in Latin American countries. Using data from a convenience sample obtained through the application of a survey of heterosexuals at a university in northern Chile (N = 283), a model of two correlated factors was used and the fit indexes obtained. The results indicate that the BCASSFS is a valid and reliable scale for measuring beliefs about children's adjustment in same-sex families in Chile. Moreover, the findings indicated that responses to BCASSFS could be explained by two factors (individual opposition and normative opposition) and that the two factors were correlated. Finally, differences between ""egalitarian,"" ""normative opponents,"" ""bigots,"" and ""individual opponents"" in the ATLG scale were examined, statistically significant differences being found between groups in the ATL and ATG subscales. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

The main objective of this paper is to report the prejudice levels of the second region population (Chile) towards Bolivian immigrants (Antofagasta is a reception area with high number of Latin American immigrants). The random and probability sample consisted of 896 participants between 18 and 65 years. We used a Chilean version of the Blatant and Subtle Prejudice Scale (Pettigrew y Meertens, 1995) and its typology to compare these groups in a set of variables. The results indicate high levels of prejudice (Msubtle = 3.38; Mblatant = 2.86) of both subtle and blatant, and positive correlation between the two forms of prejudice (r = .53). The statistical difference between the two types of prejudice is significant. The younger age groups showed significantly lower levels of blatant prejudice and women showed significantly higher levels than men."

The sample consisted of 488 subjects older than 18 years (M = 25.1), who were interviewed during the 2007 event. For this purpose, a questionnaire from the Latin American Centre of Sexuality and Human Rights (CLAM) was adapted and administered. Approximately 35% of respondents reported having experimented school, religious, or neighborhood discrimination. The more discriminated are transgender people. Approximately three fourths of respondents reported experiencing ridicule and almost 60% reported experiencing insults or threats. Transgender were significantly more likely than gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals to experience discrimination or victimization events. Finally, the parade acquired an important social and political character in the context of a clearly homophobic society. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

In Chile,10% of children attending ECEC are enrolled in private centres. Following a tradition of qualitative research, a multiple case study was carried out, allowing the exploration of four private ECEC settings. Different techniques were used for data collection: semi-structured interviews with principals, ECEC teachers, teaching assistants, and parents. In addition, a shadowing technique was used to observe principals in their daily activities. Findings show three types of leadership practices: pedagogical leadership, leadership distribution and leadership practices with families, in addition to a note about resource autonomy. All those practices were highly influenced by the nurseries’ ownership status. Where principals were the owners of the nursery, much more autonomy for decision-making and resources was observed, together with a focus on pedagogical leadership. On this basis, we conclude that in the cases where the principals are not the nurseries’ owners, it is essential to promote spaces to lead the pedagogical experiences children will have and to take decisions. Also, parents and the community must have opportunities to reflect collaboratively about education, which is also a task better promoted by the principal through fostering a shared vision in the nursery."
66,0,"TITLE: Building professionalism: Chilean ECEC leaders’ views on their participation in professional associations | KEYWORDS: Early childhood education and care; leadership; neoliberalism; professional associations; professionalism | ABSTRACT: Early childhood education and care (ECEC) leaders are required to have training and experience, given the diversity of responsibilities they have to meet. This paper explores the participation of ECEC leaders in grassroot associations and teachers’ unions. Following a qualitative methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 ECEC leaders who participated in professional associations. Findings show that ECEC leaders think that participating in professional associations enhances their professionalism by bridging gaps in professional development between the public and private sectors, promoting solidarity among leaders, and mitigating feelings of isolation. Nonetheless, neoliberal values and governmentality shape their subjectification, leading ECEC leaders to internalize regulatory norms. This study highlights the importance of further research on how ECEC leaders navigate neoliberal policies and professional development in a changing institutional context."

Admissions to private schools are mainly at the preschool level, so applications are made at an early age. This exploratory qualitative research investigates the perspectives of mothers and fathers and their experiences during the admission process to the lower transition level (NT1) and higher transition level (NT2) in elite schools of the Metropolitan Region (Chile), called prekindergarten and kindergarten. Through semi-structured interviews with nine parents of children who applied to elite educational establishments, the narratives show that the schools where their children applied presented high barriers to entry, based on economic and religious criteria and inadequate academic expectations for young children, thus contributing to class reproduction through the search for social homogeneity. Given the exploratory nature of this study, these results should be considered as a first empirical approximation."
68,0,"TITLE: You are stuck here, at the office: Chilean ECEC principals’ pedagogical leadership in JUNJI and Integra Foundation | KEYWORDS: caring leadership; Chilean early childhood education; distributed pedagogical leadership; Early childhood education and care; pedagogical leadership; public sector | ABSTRACT: This paper explores Chilean early childhood and care (ECEC) principals’ pedagogical leadership in the public sector, drawing upon literature regarding ECEC leadership. Following up a qualitative tradition, a purposive sample was used which considered 13 ECEC settings, from the 2 leading providers of public ECEC in Chile: JUNJI (the National Board of Nurseries for its acronym in Spanish) and Integra Foundation. Different techniques were used for data collection: semi-structured interviews with principals, ECEC teachers, teaching assistants, and parents. In addition, a shadowing technique was used to observe principals. Findings show that ECEC principals’ leadership is based on limited space to develop a pedagogical leadership due to a high administrative workload, alongside strong ethics of care fostered by principals, which are shared by the educational community–ECEC teachers, teaching assistants and families. We aim to generate knowledge about ECEC leadership for the Latin American context, particularly for the Chilean case, where we do not have any evidence about this topic."

This relationship was particularly apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an auto-ethnographical study, this chapter discusses government responses across 10 countries: Australia, Canada, Chile, Denmark, England, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Portugal reveal much about the perceptions of children and their early childhood professionals from a political, social and economic stance. The chapter interrogates how government responses situate children and early childhood professionals within the educational landscape in the countries studied and asks how it shapes early childhood education in particular. It illustrates that Governments overall, in the countries studied, did not recognise ECEC as fundamental to the educational continuum. In looking to the future, we question how early childhood education should develop to prepare children for the times we live in so that children are able to flourish and shape future societies with confidence and purpose. Finally, we ask whether the pandemic could possibly see the dawn of a new era in knowledge and understanding of the centrality of Early Childhood Education and Care."

Explorando la identidad profesional de las docentes de primera infancia en Chile | KEYWORDS: Agency; Early childhood teachers; Educational reforms; Professional identity; Schoolification | ABSTRACT: This article presents a study which aimed to explore the professional identity of early childhood teachers in Chile, applying a sociocultural approach. Relying on an exploratory qualitative design, data were collected through focus groups and photo-narratives. The findings show that these teachers understand that child-centred pedagogy is the pillar of their professional identity; that they perceive that this is under threat from the schoolification of early childhood education; and that they admit that their capacity to resist this tendency is limited to the classroom. These findings suggest that, having scarce resources available to negotiate their professional identity in their working context, early childhood teachers in Chile have a limited capacity for agency."

Cross-Cultural Validation of the Pornography Use Motivations Scale (PUMS) and Its Short Form (PUMS-8) | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Motivations for pornography use may vary across gender identities, sexual orientations, and geographical regions, warranting examination to promote individual and public health. The aims of this study were to validate the Pornography Use Motivations Scale (PUMS) in a diverse, multicultural sample, and develop a short form (PUMS-8) that can assess a wide range of pornography use motivations. Using data from 42 countries (N = 75,117; Mage = 32.07; SDage = 12.37), enabled us to thoroughly evaluate the dimensionality, validity, and reliability of the Pornography Use Motivations Scale (PUMS), leading to the development of the more concise PUMS-8 short scale. Additionally, language-, nationality-, gender-, and sexual-orientation-based measurement invariance tests were conducted to test the comparability across groups. Both the PUMS and the PUMS-8 assess eight pornography use motivations, and both demonstrated excellent psychometric properties. Sexual Pleasure emerged as the most frequent motivation for pornography use across countries, genders, and sexual orientations, while differences were observed concerning other motivations (e.g. self-exploration was more prevalent among gender-diverse individuals than men or women). The motivational background of pornography use showed high similarity in the examined countries. Both the PUMS and the PUMS-8 are reliable and valid measurement tools to assess different types of motivations for pornography use across countries, genders, and sexual orientations. Both scales are recommended for use in research and clinical settings."

Individual and cultural factors, such as gender identity and sexual orientation, may influence theways in which individuals describe, share, or experience their sexuality. The aims of the present study were to examine the factor structure of the five-item GlobalMeasure of Sexual Satisfaction (GMSEX) in a large sample of adults in relationships, to conduct measurement invariance tests to examine whether the GMSEX functions similarly across language-, country-, gender- and sexual orientation-based subgroups, and to evaluate its validity with sexuality and relationship- related outcomes.Results of a confirmatory analysis among 51,778 participants from42 different countries across five continents (Mage=32.39 years, SD= 12.52, 56.9% cisgender women) corroborated the proposed one-dimensional factor structure of the scale. Measurement invariance tests also indicated that the scale was fully invariant across gender- and sexual orientation-based subgroups, and partially invariant across language- and country-based subgroups. The GMSEX correlated negatively with masturbation frequency and relationship length and positively with the frequency of sexual activity. Our findings support the validity of the GMSEX as a short and reliable scale to measure sexual satisfaction across diverse samples."

An advantage of the ASEX is its simplicity and brevity (five items), making it suitable for the screening of sexual function problems in healthcare contexts and large-scale studies. The main objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the ASEX in a multi-national sample, as well as to explore sexual function according to countries, genders, and sexual orientations. Methods: The psychometric examination of the ASEX was conducted with a sample of 82,243 participants (women = 57.02%; men = 39.59%; gender-diverse = 3.38%; Mage = 32.39 years; SD = 12.52) from 42 different countries speaking 26 languages. Results: The CFA supported a one-factor solution. Multigroup CFAs supported configural, metric, partial scalar, and residual invariance across countries, languages, genders, and sexual orientations. Furthermore, the ASEX showed good internal consistency (ω =.85) and convergent validity (e.g., significant negative associations with masturbation and sexual intercourse frequency). Finally, individuals in Eastern countries, women, and asexual participants reported higher levels of sexual function issues. Conclusions and Policy Implications: The findings supported the use of the ASEX as a tool to screen for sexual function problems across diverse populations in multi-cultural settings. This scale may be used to improve our knowledge on the cross-cultural differences on the expression of sexual function, serving as the basis for the development of culturally tailored interventions for the improvement of this basic aspect of well-being."

The study sample was composed of 123 children aged 47- 62 months (age group 1 or G1:M = 55.09, SD = 4.52; 61 boys, 62 girls) and 115 children aged 63–78 months (age group 2 or G2:M = 69.27, SD = 4.16; 54 boys, 61 girls). We compared the performance by age group in all measures, after which hierarchical cluster analyses using emergent literacy scores were performed for each age group. The linguistic and cognitive factors of the resulting clusters were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise comparison. Cluster analysis yielded 3 clusters in each age group that significantly differed on linguistic and cognitive measures. The groups were identified as high, mid, and low performance. DLD groups were associated with low performance in listening comprehension, lexical decision, and syllabification in G1 and lexical repetition and final sound in G2. The high-performance groups were associated with higher performance in syllabification, initial sound, and lexical repetition in G1 and listening comprehension in G2. The main differences between age groups were observed in syllabification and lexical decision. Furthermore, the results suggest that verbal AR and WM are positive markers of linguistic profiles in the youngest group, while only verbal AR appears relevant in the oldest group. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of emergent literacy profiles and may enhance the understanding of language and literacy development in typical and DLD Spanish-speaking children."

The research covered four sectors between the north of the Las Chinas River and the area between the Las Flores stream and Palique outpost. Previous records indicate surface lithic evidence associated with the course of the Baguales River and the existence of ""chenque"" type burial sites at the top of Cerro Guido. During the surveys, 49 isolated surface finds, 23 concentrations of materials and 11 archaeological sites were recorded, three of them under rocky overhangs and eight in the open air. Of the latter, five correspond to large sites, suggesting a wider occupation of the territory by terrestrial hunter-gatherer groups. The test pits allowed a preliminary inference to the exploitation of terrestrial species and the supply of lithic raw materials upstream and/or to high altitude sectors near the Baguales mountain range. New dates extend the known chronology to c. 2500 BP. At the Las Flores Formation, the excavation of a rocky shelter revealed isolated and scattered human skeletal remains in an unusual context for the area, where previously only ""chenque"" burials had been recorded."

The site, dated between 560 and 635 BP, is noteworthy for its record of cetacean bones, mostly found on the surface, and the prevalence of guanacos in relation to other marine mammals, birds and taxa. Results confirmed the importance of guanaco remains in the subsistence and supply of bone raw material, supporting the economic theory that has traditionally considered that land resources played a fundamental role for human groups during the late Holocene. The significance of guanaco exploitation at the site, the greater number of young individuals, and the exploitation strategies, food chain, and technological management of the species are discussed."

This work focuses on deepening the analysis of the anencephalic fetus called Ultima Esperanza A, sustained by the availability of new methods for the analysis of bone material and by the presence of unstudied remains from the individual. After estimating the age using new regression equations and considering the alterations produced by fetal neurological defects in the development of long bones, we suggest the possibility that the age of the fetus is between one or two weeks less than that proposed previously. New bioanthropological data on the individual are provided, emphasizing its importance and the few documented cases of anencephalic fetuses found in archaeological contexts worldwide. Finally, the possibility that the individual Ultima Esperanza A and the other fetus found at the site (Ultima Esperanza B) were born from a multiple pregnancy is discussed, based on the possible lower age difference between them and the higher incidence of anencephaly in these cases."

82,7,"TITLE: SOCIAL PROTEST IN CHILE: Moralization of attitudes through politicization of social movement identity | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: While collective action research has shed light on the psychological motivations driving protesters’ participation, less is known about how such participation can be sustained. One approach to understanding why people remain psychologically engaged in collective action is to consider its psychological impact on them. This chapter aims to bring attention to the social–psychological consequences of collective action, focusing on how participation may psychologically impact protesters’ morality and identity. Particularly, participating in collective action has the potential to deepen protesters’ psychological sense of politicization by moralizing relevant attitudes (i.e., strengthening their moral conviction), which results from strengthening their identification with the social movement (i.e., politicized identity). Given Chile’s evolving democratic and socio-political landscape, Chilean social movements may serve as powerful psychological channels for such politicization processes. As such, this chapter highlights evidence on how collective action participation may moralize attitudes through politicized identification in the context of social movements in Chile."
83,7,"TITLE: From protest to ideology: how social movements reshape political orientations over time | KEYWORDS: Chile; dynamic panel models; Political ideology; political interest; social movements | ABSTRACT: Do attitudes toward social movements influence citizens' ideological preferences? We address this question by examining an unprecedented cycle of protests in Chile, during which social movements challenged deep inequalities. In this context, we argue that individuals who value progressive social movements will be more receptive to collective action frames aligned with leftist values. This, in turn, will encourage them to shift their ideological position toward the left. However, based on insights from social cognition theories, we also claim that this effect is mostly restricted to citizens highly interested in political affairs. Among their low-interest counterparts, the effect is smaller and short-lasting. We empirically evaluate these assertions by estimating dynamic linear panel models based on data from the Chilean Longitudinal Social Surveyfrom 2016 to 2021, a period marked by intense mobilization. Our results largely confirm our theoretical expectations, while also raising new questions for future research."

But how does positivity manifest in the daily life experiences of individuals around the world? The present study asked 15,244 college students from 62 nations, in 42 languages, to describe a situation they experienced the previous day using the Riverside Situational Q-sort (RSQ). Using expert ratings, the overall positivity of each situation was calculated for both nations and individuals. The positivity of the average situation in each nation was strongly related to the economic development of the nation as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI). For individuals’ daily experiences, the economic status of their nation also predicted the positivity of their experience, even more than their family socioeconomic status. Further analyses revealed the specific characteristics of the average situations for higher HDI nations that make their experiences more positive. Higher HDI was associated with situational experiences involving humor, socializing with others, and the potential to express emotions and fantasies. Lower HDI was associated with an increase in the presence of threats, blame, and hostility, as well as situational experiences consisting of family, religion, and money. Despite the increase in a few negative situational characteristics in lower HDI countries, the overall average experience still ranged from neutral to slightly positive, rather than negative, suggesting that greater HDI may not necessarily increase positive experiences but rather decrease negative experiences. The results illustrate how national economic status influences the lives of individuals even within a single instance of daily life, with large and powerful consequences when accumulated across individuals within each nation."

Subjective wealth was assessed by individuals’ perceptions of their personal wealth (current/anticipated) and of their country´s wealth, whereas objective country-level wealth was assessed by GDP and HDI. Multilevel analyses showed that living in a country with a lower objective wealth and perceiving the country's relative wealth as low were associated with higher levels of perceived realistic threat. We also found that an anticipated decrease in personal wealth in the future was associated with higher threat perceptions only in low HDI countries. Our results suggest that perceived realistic threat is fostered by a perceived decline in the current wealth of the country, and country-level wealth may play a role in calibrating threat responses to anticipated personal wealth."
86,-1,"TITLE: When nonactivists care: Group efficacy mediates the effect of social identification and perceived instability on the legitimacy of collective action | KEYWORDS: collective action; group efficacy; legitimacy; perceived instability; social identity | ABSTRACT: In recent years, multiple social movements have emerged around the world. In addition, public surveys indicate the highest recorded levels of support for protest. In this context of acceptance of collective action, we examine the role of nonactivists in the perceived legitimacy of social movements, as this “passive” support can contribute to social change. Given that antecedents of legitimacy have been neglected in the literature, we carried out a survey (N = 605) among a general sample of the population in Chile to shed light on this issue. We found that social identification with movements and perceived instability predicted the perceived legitimacy of protests by social movements, and that both variables had only indirect effects through group efficacy. This suggests that perceiving social movements as able to achieve success can lead nonactivists to perceive their actions as legitimate, highlighting the importance to movements of being seen to be effective."
87,0,"TITLE: Cultural Values Moderate the Impact of Relative Deprivation | KEYWORDS: Hofstede’s national values; life satisfaction; political trust; relative deprivation; social inequality | ABSTRACT: Relative deprivation (RD) is the judgment that one or one’s ingroup is worse off compared with some relevant standard coupled with feelings of dissatisfaction, anger, and resentment. RD predicts a wide range of outcomes, but it is unclear whether this relationship is moderated by national cultural differences. Therefore, in the first study, we used national assessments of individual-collectivism and power distance to code 303 effect sizes from 31 different countries with 200,578 participants. RD predicted outcomes ranging from life satisfaction to collective action more strongly within individualistic nations. A second survey of 6,112 undergraduate university students from 28 different countries confirmed the predictive value of RD. Again, the relationship between individual RD and different outcomes was stronger for students who lived in more individualistic countries. Group-based RD also predicted political trust more strongly for students who lived in countries marked by lower power distance. RD effects, although consistent predictors, are culturally bounded. In particular, RD is more likely to motivate reactions within individualistic countries that emphasize individual agency and achievement as a source of self-worth."

We propose the construct of contextualism, referring to beliefs about the importance of context in understanding people, as a facet of cultural collectivism. A brief measure was developed and refined across 19 nations (Study 1: N = 5,241), showing good psychometric properties for cross-cultural use and correlating well at the nation level with other supposed facets and indicators of I-C. In Study 2 (N = 8,652), nation-level contextualism predicted ingroup favoritism, corruption, and differential trust of ingroup and outgroup members, while controlling for other facets of I-C, across 35 nations. We conclude that contextualism is an important part of cultural collectivism. This highlights the importance of beliefs alongside values and self-representations and contributes to a wider understanding of cultural processes. © The Author(s) 2013."

This study examines several intergroup variables including contact, national and Latino American identities, group distinctiveness, realistic threat, intergroup anxiety, and acculturation preferences as predictors of prejudice on the part of both Chilean natives and Peruvian immigrants. Three hundred Peruvian immigrants (194 females and 106 males) and 300 Chileans (199 females and 101 males) participated in the study. Acculturation preferences, perceived group distinctiveness, and especially intergroup contact were shown to be important predictors of prejudice toward out-group members. Intergroup anxiety and realistic threat mediated some of these effects. The pattern of these results also varied as a function of nationality. Theoretical as well as practical implications for further research are discussed. © 2010 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues."

Perceived ingroup responsibility and dehumanization as predictors of empathy felt for the victim group | KEYWORDS: Dehumanization; Empathy; Ingroup responsibility; Intergroup conflict | ABSTRACT: This research examined the effects of reminders of ingroup responsibility for past wrongdoings on perception of ingroup responsibility and victim dehumanization as predictors of empathy. Two experiments set in different intergroup contexts found that reminders of ingroup responsibility generated empathy through perception of ingroup responsibility and deflected empathy through subtle victim dehumanization. In Experiment 1, set in the context of indigenous-non-indigenous relations in Chile (N = 124), it was found that reminders of ingroup (vs. individual) responsibility generated empathy by increasing a perception of ingroup responsibility and deflected it through decreased attribution of secondary emotions to the victim group. Experiment 2 replicated the effects in a different context, the recent 1992-1995 war in Bosnia (N = 158). Reminders of ingroup responsibility (vs. no reminders) generated empathy by increasing a perception of ingroup responsibility and deflected it through decreased attribution of secondary emotions to the victim group.

However, there are doubts regarding the nature of trust judgments. We argue that trust judgments concerning political institutions centrally involve the consideration of both the preparation and resources of the institutions that enable it to fulfill its goals (capacity), and the orientation of such goals toward the wellbeing of citizens (benevolence). Results are based on a survey carried out in Santiago, Chile, during 2005 on 996 people. We conclude that both capacity and benevolence are strong predictors of trust and that, beyond the direct influence of each of them, they also have a joint effect on trust judgments."

Seventy-one men and women with dual, Turkish-German, national identities were asked to think about positive aspects of either their German or their Turkish identity. Later, attitudes toward Germans and Turks were assessed using a single category implicit association test (SC-IAT) and self-report scales. Results showed that attitudes toward Turks were generally more positive than attitudes toward Germans, that SC-IAT scores reflecting attitudes toward Turks and Germans were unrelated, and that the identity priming affected men's, but not women's, SC-IAT scores. This finding is discussed in terms of men's greater flexibility in national identification. Explicit attitude measures were largely unaffected by the priming. © 2008 Sage Publications."

Beyond the conceptual differences between forgiveness and reparation, this study analyzes the differential relations they have with important cognitive (victimization, demand for outgroup remorse, and demand for truth) and emotional (anger, collective guilt, and shame) variables involved in the reconciliation process. Respondents were university students who identified with the 2 major political groups originally involved in the conflict (N right wing = 225; N left wing = 264). Overall, results confirmed that forgiveness and reparation were positively correlated only in the case of the group associated with perpetrating political repression. Forgiveness was predicted mainly by the emotional factors (collective anger and guilt) whereas reparation was predicted by a combination of cognitive and emotional factors.

This policy of violence gives us an idea of the daily confrontation between the elite and the pig farmers, who belonged to the lower class segment of the population. The government supported a model of civility based on the social control strategies promoted by the Bourbon administration. The pig farmers, mostly poor, collectively defended their business which provided them a basic income to survive on. With the frequent attacks on the street pigs and their owners, the elite class intended to prevent the poor from achieving economic independence as it was to their benefit to keep the farmers available for working as laborers in such areas as mining, agriculture and cattle-raising."

99,6,"TITLE: Santiago, the Non-city? Destruction, Creation, and Precariousness of Verticalized Space | KEYWORDS: Housing; Urban development; Urban renewal | ABSTRACT: This chapter situates urbicide as an intentional process that requires the devastation of the public, the destruction of the private and domestic, to decompose the urban structure and the city, generating a (re)production of urban space, in some cases precarious. This interpretation logic situates verticalization processes and their “precarious” expression as a spatialization of urbicide. Beyond its identification and documentation, it provides patterns of localization, diversification, and even intensification in contemporary urban production that transcend the city of Santiago de Chile, expressing a process of recursive urbicide in the logic of production of urban space. This methodology is structured in two main parts using quantitative methods. The first focuses on the analysis of the evolution of verticalization in the Santiago Metropolitan Area (AMS), explained through three hypotheses. The second develops the argument of how verticalization has transcended from precarious areas and communes to precarious silos, a new way of understanding the precariousness of affordable high-rise housing. We use the building permits for new construction and regularization of new construction of high-rise buildings of more than nine floors (National Institute of Statistics, INE) to construct the evolution of verticalization and its transition towards precariousness with an index in the AMS from 1990 to 2019."

This work focuses on the impact of Peruvian migrants, as the major migrant group in Santiago's downtown, and their recovery of semi-abandoned places and shops, creating a ""Little Lima"". This is an area where migrants look for work, eat and enjoy themselves. The study reveals the positive effects of this phenomenon in the recovery and revitalization of central areas, and in reinvigorating trade and the use of public spaces. It also recognizes the precarious nature of migrant dwelling in older housing in the center, which creates problems of overcrowding, and access to health and education, which -given the absence of social policies aimed at immigration- can (and is starting to) create short-term conflicts. ©EURE."

The Case of Pension Privatisation in Pinochet’s Chile | KEYWORDS: authoritarianism; business power; Chile; economic elites; pensions; social policy | ABSTRACT: The central role of economic elites in shaping public policy in Latin America has become increasingly clear. Yet most of the recent literature on the subject focuses on democratic contexts. This paper analyses pension privatisation in Chile as a case study for improving our understanding of business–state interaction in authoritarian contexts. Globally, the 1981 pension reform carried out during the Pinochet dictatorship became an example for pension privatisation elsewhere. Analysis of the policy-making process, based on novel empirical material, shows that from 1973 financial groups accumulated growing power which enabled them to first (a) defeat their opponents within the economic elite, (b) overpower their rivals within the state and, finally, (c) force Pinochet into passing pension privatisation legislation. Our results stress the need to include the study of different actors’ power resources – along with ideological issues and the regime structure – in attempts to understand the outcome of policy processes in authoritarian contexts."
102,8,"TITLE: Social conflicts over the use of water resources in Chile: the role of social movements and business power | KEYWORDS: Business power; collective action; environmental conflicts; Latin America; social movements; water resources | ABSTRACT: This paper explores conflicts in contemporary Chile between local communities and economic elites over water resources usage, developing a frameworkthat seeks to bridge the gap between the literature on social movements and the scholarly work on business politics. It examines two similar cases. The first case deals with the conflict between large avocado producers and the rural community of Petorca, Central Chile, which has meant water deprivation for the aggrieved community. In the second case, the local community of Aysén, in Chilean Patagonia, successfully challenged business interests by halting a mega-hydroelectric project. We found that local communities can prevail when at least three conditions are met. First, the formation of a broad contingent coalition. Second, the elaboration of collective action frames to mobilise new constituencies. Third, the capacity to forge alliances with elite actors, which enhances the movement’s potential to engage in collective action."
103,19,"TITLE: Regulatory continuity of the pension system in democracy: the role of the economic elite Continuidad del sistema de AFP en democracia: el rol del poder de la elite económica | KEYWORDS: AFP; business power; Chile; economic elite; Pension system; social policies | ABSTRACT: Since mid-2016, when the “No more AFP” movement took to the streets to protest against the pension system based on individual capitalisation accounts, the need for a wide-ranging reform of the pension system has remai-ned at the top of the agenda. Nonetheless, Chile’s political system has not been able to address this issue, which has become especially salient and contentious during the COVID-driven crisis. In this context, a research question that ad-dresses the factors explaining the remarkable resilience of the AFP system in post-authoritarian Chile has become highly relevant. This work argues that the more influential current frameworks do not offer the necessary analytical tools to understand this issue comprehensively. As such, this article suggests that the traditional, structural-instrumental analytical framework for the study of business power should be supplemented with analysis of ideational elements of power. The augmented conceptual approach developed in this research is effective in capturing long-term, strategic investments carried out by the economic elite in order to increase their power. Likewise, this novel conceptual approach is useful for understanding why the Concertación party grouping not only abandoned its original programme, but ended up actually promoting fur-ther privatisation of the AFP system."

In this context, one critical area which we require a better understanding of is the influence of business on the development of social policies. Chile offers a fascinating puzzle in this regard: why did a centre-left coalition, elected on a platform of “creating a social security system with more elements of solidarity” end up passing reforms that consolidated the private, individually managed pension scheme imposed by the military regime (1973-1990)? This paper attempts to shed light on this question, focusing on the debate around the old-age pension system during the first Concertación government, the Aylwin Administration (1990-1994). The analysis is based on process-tracing. Primary sources for the analysis include interviews with key informants, and congressional and press records. In summary, this work shows that despite the new democratic setting, the Chilean economic elite continued to control the policy process by means of multiple mechanisms."
105,14,"TITLE: Socio-environmental implications of the decarbonization of copper and lithium mining and mineral processing | KEYWORDS: Copper; Decarbonization; Impacts; Lithium; Mineral processing; Mining | ABSTRACT: Minerals and metals will play an important role in adapting to climate change and keeping the increase in global average temperature below 2C as they are essential to the transition to low-carbon energy, electromobility and 4.0 technologies. This is a great opportunity, but there are great challenges involved in preventing this climate contribution from being greater than the potential impacts resulting from increased production. This study aims to identify the potential social and environmental impacts of decarbonization actions that can be integrated into the operational processes of copper and lithium mining. In addition, the list of identified impacts was also linked with the indicator framework currently used to assess sustainability in different contexts (social, environmental, and economic). The selection and analysis of the articles are based on the Systematic Analysis of Literature, which is based on the following steps: Identification, Screening, Eligibility, and Inclusion. The actions were broken down into 5 categories: a) Electrification, b) Change of fuel, c) Circular economy, d) Promotion of low-carbon energy generation, and e) Technological changes for energy efficiency. Then they were linked to each of the operating processes of copper and lithium mining (brine and spodumene). Finally, to learn about potential social and environmental impacts of the decarbonization actions in the copper and lithium mining industry, 2 sustainability indicator frameworks were added: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Of a total of 5 categories associated with decarbonization issues in energy-intensive industries, 56 actions were identified as the contribution that these industries can make to climate change. However, only 26 of these actions managed to be linked to copper and lithium mining. The document links the SDG and GRI indicators with the identified environmental and social impacts of decarbonization actions. It has been demonstrated that the mining industry, due to its operational characteristics, has direct socio-environmental impacts on the intervention sites and has been managed with different strategies (e.g., management, technology). This study also provides evidence that decarbonization of this industry as an end-user of low-carbon technologies will have socio-environmental implications in the supply chain of these technologies."
106,14,"TITLE: One step forward, two steps back? Shifting accumulation strategies in the lithium production network in Chile | KEYWORDS: Accumulation strategies; Batteries; Global production networks; Lithium | ABSTRACT: The global race for critical minerals for the energy transition is triggering manifold discourses and initiatives in resource-rich countries regarding how to take advantage of the moment. From conventional accumulation strategies based on the capture of resource rents to more ambitious strategies seeking to move forward in the value chain, resource peripheries are in a decisive conjuncture. While the literature discussing the development and embeddedness of battery production networks in mineral-rich countries is a solid starting point, this article seeks to examine how the contingent position of mineral-rich states in the production network is the outcome of internal and external struggles that define its accumulation strategy. For such purpose, this contribution examines the making and unmaking of accumulation strategies based on lithium extraction in Chile, the country with the world´s largest reserves. The results show that a pendular movement between the strategy of exporting lithium brine at a large scale to appropriate resource rents and the development of value-added products in the country has undermined the development of the lithium value chain in Chile. Conclusions indicate that it is crucial to define a transversal and sustainable strategy that allows the country to take advantage of the energy transition."

The experience reveals how promoting formalization strategies that provide much broader support for ASM, beyond mining licenses and tenure rights (i.e., legalization), defined as formalization (e.g., geological data, mining equipment, and skills transfer programs), is vital. Information gathered from secondary sources and semi-structured interviews reveals that while legalization of ASM has been largely successful in Chile, there are still challenges in terms of formalization, especially improvement of exploration and production. Furthermore, ENAMI needs to modernize its own installations and development model to afford ASM greater opportunities of becoming a sustainable and competitive business activity."
108,14,"TITLE: Social protest at mining territories: Examining contentious politics at mining districts in Chile | KEYWORDS: Contentious politics; Extractive industries; Mining; Mining territories; Territorial turn | ABSTRACT: The territorial turn in the research agenda about extractive industries and development has remarked the uneven and entangled processes through which industries anchor across space. Whereas the uneven developmental performance of mining areas has been largely discussed, this turn offers fertile ground to interact with the literature about contentious politics and examine how the spatial distinction of mining territories also shapes local unrest and social mobilization. This paper examines social protest dynamics at mining districts by exploring four dimensions of contentious politics and comparing its prevalence between mining and non-mining districts. For such a purpose, the paper distinguishes between mining and non-mining districts through a cluster analysis based on a set of mining-related variables. Afterward, it analyses four relevant dimensions of social protests related to extractive industries (labor, public services, local politics, and environmental) based on a database of protest actions registered between 2009 and 2019 in 18 newspapers. The results show that mining districts are distinguished by social protests related to public services and labor demands, while social protest related to local politics and environmental issues does not exhibit a significant difference between mining and non-mining districts. Thereby, the districts in which mining exerts a larger influence face higher rates of social protest only regarding labor and public services."
109,14,"TITLE: Mobilising Rents: Natural Gas Production Networks and the Landlord State in Peru and Bolivia | KEYWORDS: corruption; extractivism; Global Production Networks; ground rent; landlord state; resource peripheries | ABSTRACT: The ongoing choreography of extractive industries asks for a deeper appraisal about the processes and scales underpinning resource extraction. This paper unpacks how the assembly between natural gas production networks, extractivist states and local politics is anchored in resource peripheries in Peru and Bolivia through contingent schemes of value distribution. From a critical production network approach, the paper examines the transformation of resource peripheries through the transfer of natural gas rents to sub-national governments and, more specifically, through investments in public infrastructure. Such investments embed natural gas production networks to local politics through three processes: providing an image of modernisation and progress; coopting local elites through corruption; and mobilising local labour. In conclusion, the articulation between production networks and extractivist states involves an entangled scheme of rent distribution that flows at very local levels and consolidates multi-scalar arrangements for resource extraction."
110,14,"TITLE: Natural gas revenues, subnational politics, and agrarian change in Peru and Bolivia | KEYWORDS: Agrarian change; Extractive industries; Resource rents; Subnational political economy | ABSTRACT: The literature about natural resources and development has largely described states’ failure to translate large resource endowments into sustainable development. Consequently, terms like resource curse or Dutch disease have become widely accepted. However, the literature examining this process at the subnational level has been less conclusive regarding the local effects, such as economic diversification. It is therefore pertinent to examine the contextual conditions underpinning both the expenditure of resource rents at the subnational level and the effects of such expenditures on economic diversification, particularly on the agrarian sector. To do so, this contribution deploys a comparative analysis between the Tarija department in Bolivia and La Convencion province in Peru. Both are hydrocarbon-rich areas in which subnational governments received massive amounts of resource rents. A deep examination based on qualitative and quantitative data permits the affirmation that whereas similar place-specific conditions boosted a massive investment of resource rents into public infrastructure, the composition of the agrarian sector defined a different trajectory in each case. While the strong peasant organization of Tarija obtained a direct transfer of resource rents, the transfer of those rents to the peasants in La Convencion was only through wages conditioned to work in the construction sector. As such, resource rents undermined the agrarian sector in La Convencion, while in Tarija the sector remained stable and potentially stronger in the long run."

Although in the 2008 crisis the state redefined mechanisms of property, control and access to natural resources to strengthen the resilience of the salmon industry, the lessons learned by the system and the community between one crisis and the next were not enough to avoid a new crisis. Chile’s existing governance mechanisms are reactive and not proactive and, therefore, their capacity to lead the industry towards long-term sustainable practices is flawed."
112,14,"TITLE: Extractivism beyond territory: Examining the socio-spatial relations of the natural gas industry in peru and bolivia (abstract) Los extractivismos más allá del territorio: Una lectura a las relaciones socioespaciales de la industria del gas natural en perú | KEYWORDS: Extractive industries; Extractivism; Latin America; Territory, socio-spatial relationships | ABSTRACT: The Latin American literature about ´extractivism´ has shown the spatial contradictions of the development models based on the extensive and intensive appropriation of natural resources. The core spatial concept of such a literature has been the territory. From such a concept, the literature addresses the state, to examine the organization of the resource-dependent development model, and the local resistances to show the varieties of communitarian practices and local projects of resource governance. Whereas these concepts have highlighted the territorial dimension of the extractivismo, there are manifold socio-spatial processes that underpin the geographical assemblage of extractivismo that ask for a more dynamic a relational spatial examination. This paper progresses in such a direction by analyzing the socio-spatial dynamics in which hydrocarbon industry stands in Peru. More specifically, by researching the interactions between production networks and their territorial embeddedness, and the production of scalar regimes of natural gas rents within extractives states."

Aportes y límites de la producción académica reciente | KEYWORDS: Chile; Conflicts; Extractivism; Scales; Territory | ABSTRACT: This article analyzes the academic production that addresses the concepts of conflict, territory and extractivism in Chile. The analysis of 32 articles published in indexed journals between 2015 and 2020 accounts for a significant concern for this issue. We characterize this stage in this body of work in relation to its treatment of the different concepts, as well as the methods used, the actors studied, and the scales considered. This academic production appears marked by a routinization, both regarding the conceptual deployment and in the predominance of case studies. In order to maintain the dynamism of this field, we invite to take into consideration the theoretical depth of each concept, diversify the methods and broaden the objects of research."

115,14,"TITLE: Contesting uneven development: The political geography of natural gas rents in Peru and Bolivia | KEYWORDS: Resource governance; Resource rents; Revenue distribution; Structured coherence; Sub-national conflicts; Uneven development | ABSTRACT: Political and academic debates about the distribution of resource rents to producing areas have addressed the issue of whether or not the transfers unleash conflicts. While this kind of debate is valid, the present paper argues that such a discussion is missing the point regarding the processes behind said types of conflicts, as well as how such conflicts are framed at the sub-national political geography of the state. By more deeply exploring these dimensions, the argument of this paper is that the production of uneven development within sub-national areas is crucial for understanding the above-mentioned conflicts and how the central state internalises those conflicts, producing new political geographies of rent distribution. As such, different territorial discourses of autonomy emerge along with uneven development, but their capacity to reach institutional autonomy is grounded on the spatial politics of each state. Empirically, this paper analyses how natural gas rents are distributed to sub-national producing areas in Peru and Bolivia, and how the production of uneven development through natural gas rents at sub-national level re-activated previous territorial demands for autonomy, which were internalised by central states in different ways."
116,14,"TITLE: Natural Gas Production Networks: Resource Making and Interfirm Dynamics in Peru and Bolivia | KEYWORDS: extractive industries; global production networks; interfirm dynamics; regional development; resource making | ABSTRACT: Economic geographers have largely shown concern about the interaction between extractive industries and local economies by studying how lead firms create economic linkages with national firms. From a global production networks approach, this work looks to deepen the understanding of interfirm dynamics in extractive industries. This work has a critical position over previous research, however, because such contributions do not consider how resources are socioecologically produced. This article shows that the socioecological relations that make natural gas an exploitable resource are critical to study the articulation between global and local firms. The contingent interaction between states, firms, and the biophysical properties of nature set up the conditions for interfirm dynamics because it creates (or does not create) a steady and continuous demand of services to perform specialized activities. This was the case in Bolivia where the neoliberal reforms of the early 1990 s, the massive involvement of lead firms, and the characteristics of natural gas deposits created conditions to develop industry-specific suppliers. Conversely, Peru has not been able to appraise its natural gas reserves and did not set up conditions for such suppliers. Therefore, the resource-making process is crucial for studying how global production networks and extractive industries are shaping the geography of uneven development."

This paper deals with the relationship between salmon entrepreneurs and the Chilean State during the institutional change in aquaculture. This is done through the process tracing methodology. An analysis is made of the process of forming a coalition between business owners and the state, the relevance of the state's success in generating autonomy in the institutional design process, and the problems of collective action that arose among the salmon business owners. The conclusion is that the salmon farmers who best positioned their preferences were those who led the guild in institutional change, and who participated in the institutional design."
118,8,"TITLE: Global Salmon Networks: Unpacking Ecological Contradictions at the Production Stage | KEYWORDS: ecological contradictions; global production networks; natural resources; salmon production; territorial configuration; value dynamics | ABSTRACT: Firms’ strategies for turning nature into commodities are heavily oriented toward reducing the ecological indeterminacy of the production process by controlling its biophysical properties to ensure that nature commodification leads to a profitable business. However, research on global production networks (GPNs) has not focused on firms’ strategies in controlling the impacts of biophysical properties on the production network’s organization. This article aims to fill this gap by reviewing the literature on GPN and resource geographies on nature’s transformation into commodities to show how, in resource-based industries, ecological contradictions establish the territorial embeddedness and value dynamics of the production network. This article empirically examines the production of Atlantic salmon in Chile and how firms’ strategies for handling the ecological contradictions after an economic crisis (infectious salmon anemia virus crisis) changed the spatial production network’s organization and constrained the value-creation process. The results of this work aid in the understanding of firms’ strategies at the production stage as drivers of the continuities and changes in production networks. Finally, the connection between value dynamics and ecological contradictions opens a set of challenges to this research agenda."
119,6,"TITLE: Exploring intermediate cities in Latin America: mixed mobile methods for mobility assessment in Villarrica, Chile | KEYWORDS: intermediate cities; Latin America; mobile methods; mobility; urban rural linkages | ABSTRACT: Intermediate cities have had a key role in urban dynamics and development in Latin America since the second half of the twentieth century, yet the theoretical and methodological approaches to research about these types of city have not been suited to their complexity. Most research on them reduces to demographic criteria, overlooking the fact that they are characterised by intense socio-spatial interactions with their surrounding rural areas and other nearby urban centres. This is a serious shortcoming in terms of the potential use of such research for urban planning, and the resulting development processes of these cities. The present work proposes that while research based on the physical patterns of the movement of people (including commuting) are relevant, it is necessary to delve deeper into the process of mobility in order to improve the comprehension of intermediate cities in Latin America. First, the article illustrates the weak points of traditional approaches to intermediate cities and from this proposes that the theoretical and methodological contributions of the new mobility paradigm (Sheller and Urry 2006, Environment and Planning A 38 207–26) can contribute considerably to the study of such cities, as well as the phenomena of intermediation inherent to them. The article then introduces a new methodological proposal, based on mixed mobile methods, that contributes to empirical research and understanding of intermediate cities. An empirical application of the methodology is performed in Chile, specifically in the city of Villarrica in the La Araucanía Region. Based on this application, the article provides some important conclusions regarding the research experience and the theoretical and methodological approach necessary to attend to the socio-spatial complexity of intermediate cities in Latin America."
120,6,"TITLE: Intermediate cities and local governments: Scalar gaps in the Region of La Araucanía, Chile Ciudades intermedias y gobiernos locales: Desfases escalares en la región de la araucanía, Chile | KEYWORDS: Intermediate cities; Local government; Urban sustainability | ABSTRACT: Local governments of intermediate cities face significant challenges regarding their interactions with surrounding areas, as well as with other cities. The present article deals with such challenges, based on two conceptual frameworks: intermediation processes, and scale. The methodological focus utilizes a qualitative approach, based on mobile methodologies, complemented by a quantitative commuting assessment. The results show that local governments from the main intermediation nodes in the Region of La Araucanía face problems related with intermediation process, specifically regarding urban sprawl and roadways. Furthermore, local governments underestimate indigenous dynamics within and between cities, which is a key element in the region. The results allow us to conclude that scalar gaps represent a key problem for local governments of intermediate cities, which must be resolved in order to improve planning processes and enhance the local sustainability of such cities."

However, such representation involves two constraints to understand the region's cities. First, it does not recognize the daily practices of their inhabitants; and second, it locates hierarchically one landscape perspective over others possible perspectives, like the intercultural or Mapuche perspective, among many. Against this background, this work proposes a non-representational insight to the Araucanía's landscape. Non-representational approach highlights daily socio-spatial practices and the senses of place that underpins the landscape of Araucanía cities. The methodology is based on walking interviews around Temuco, Villarrica and Angol. It allows us to understand how actors live and perceive their cities day a day. We conclude that beyond classic landscape perspectives, Araucanía's cities have complex intercultural interactions and strong urban/rural linkages that must be considered as constitutive elements of landscape."

Evidence from the Chilean Salmon Industry Crisis, 2008 | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The financial crisis of 2008 triggered an academic and intellectual debate over whether that particular crisis could mean a change to neoliberalism or a movement toward a post-neoliberal moment. Underlining those debates was a return to Marxian analytics and ideas on crisis and political and economic tools for explaining the economic crisis of the time. Around the same time another sort of crisis was unfolding in the marine waters of the Los Lagos Region of southern Chile. The Immuno Salmon Anemia (ISA) virus rapidly spread through currents, affecting the production of Atlantic salmon in the country."
123,-1,"TITLE: Geographical representations: The role of the military in the development of contemporary Chilean geography | KEYWORDS: Chile; Chilean geography; Geographical representations; Geopolitics; Military geography | ABSTRACT: This article points to two geographical representations. Both relate to the activities of the Military Geographical Institute (IGM) in Chile. The first representation, following on from the importance of the cartographic tradition in state-building, and the role of military institutions in this process, is a critical engagement with the representation of Chilean academic geography on the international stage via the IGM. The paper will reflect on the circumstances through which the IGM assumed this role, and questions its legitimacy as a consequence. The second points to the representation of geography as a cartographical exercise. Historically, similar institutions to the IGM in Latin America have played important roles in creating their national spaces, through mapping and other practices that communicate geopolitical representations of the national space. These representations of geography as cartography remain important since maps are used to communicate a 'national truth' to the wider population as well as associated expansionist geopolitical narrative. The representation of the 'Chilean Antarctic' will be used as an example of this activity. Both of these representations - of national space-building, and as the face of Chilean geography in international fora - are based on core elements of geopolitics that have to be engaged with critically since they reveal the continued importance of the military in representing national geographies. This article provides such an engagement, and concludes by arguing that representations of Chilean geography need to be democratised and demilitarised. © 2014 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons."
124,24,"TITLE: Coping with natural disasters and urban risk: An approach to urban sustainability from socio-environmental fragmentation and urban vulnerability assessment | KEYWORDS: Santiago de Chile; Socio-environmental fragmentation; Urban vulnerability | ABSTRACT: Purpose - Cities have been exposed to a variety of natural disasters such as flooding, extreme temperatures, storms, earthquakes, and other natural shocks, and have had to respond and adapt to such pressures over time. In the context of global climate change, natural disasters have increased across the globe. Apart from climate change, many urban environments in Latin America are experiencing significant transformations in land use patterns, socio-demographic change, changing labor markets, and economic growth, resulting from recent decades of globalization. Such transformations have resulted in the internal fragmentation of cities. In this context, the purpose of the present chapter is to demonstrate the importance in both theoretical and methodological terms, of integrating the concept of socio-environmental fragmentation into urban vulnerability research in order to make progress toward higher degrees of local sustainability in those areas of the city that suffer natural disasters and fragmentation. Methodology/approach - A mixed methods approach is used in order to combine different technical issues from urban and climate change studies. Findings - The findings are related to the importance of an integrated approach, regarding the complexity of urban life, and the relationship between the urban, the social, and the environmental phenomenon. Social implications - This chapter relates to the revisit of the current state of preparedness and to determine whether further adaptations are required. The authors understood that these kinds of mixed approaches are necessary in order to understand the new complexity of urban processes."

On a more detailed scale, based on characteristic urban morphology types, land uses and extensions are correlated with vegetation cover and surface temperatures in so-called climatic sub-zones, in the municipalities of Peñalolen, Santiago Centro and Cerrillos, that represent different urban locations, natural cover and socioeconomic variables across the city. The article concludes that there are areas with adverse conditions for the population and configurations that highlight the heterogeneity and diversity of these municipalities. © EURE."

The study analyzes Chilean university classifications because they have been used in setting up higher education public policies. Design/methodology/approach: The existing classifications of Chilean universities were identified in the literature. Researchers determined categories, criteria and/or indicators used, as well as their main purposes as described by the authors of the classifications. All the criteria and indicators identified were directly related to the quality of academic activities and to the results of the university accreditation processes. The institutional accreditation outcomes and variables were studied using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Findings: The a priori approach proved to be consistent with the results of institutional quality assurance, despite of the variability in individual performances. The empirical systems, however, do not show any contribution to the improvement of public policies in higher education. The results clearly show that classifications based on performance do not necessarily ensure improvements in institutional quality. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this analysis is the first study of the relationship between university classification and quality assurance. The growing number of proposals for different empirical classifications in Chilean universities is evidence of institutional diversity only. However, the classification designs did not respond to purposes such as public policies improvements and other expected results from these instruments."
127,0,"TITLE: Chilean universities and institutional quality assurance processes | KEYWORDS: Chile; Institutional accreditation; Quality assurance; Types of universities | ABSTRACT: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct a quantitative analysis of the university accreditation processes in Chilean universities. The aim is to determine the effects of the different variables, especially the type of institutions (state- and privately owned, with and without state financial support) on the results obtained. Design/methodology/approach - Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis of official data. Findings - Results indicate consistency in the accreditation processes in Chilean universities, as those variables directly associated with the processes accounted for approximately 70 per cent of the variation in the length of accreditation periods (between 0 and seven years), these variables being the ones that defined the type of universities. High dispersion was found in six state-owned universities that behaved as if they were private universities and in two private universities that behaved as if they were state universities. However, a high percentage of the universities included in the analysis maintained their affiliation to their corresponding legal group, when their performance in accreditation processes was analyzed. Originality/value - The results of the university accreditation processes in Chile have been the focus of a intense debate due to the legal and economic conflicts between the different types of universities. This study constitutes the first scientific analysis of the results of these processes, especially in terms of the performance of the different types of universities, thus enabling a better interpretation of the results. This information is useful not only in the terms of the legal reforms that are being carried out in Chile, but they also help the understanding of the processes of accreditation of higher education in other Latin American countries."

We evaluated: number of published articles; the number of publications divided by the number of people in science and technology (number pub/number peo); the top incidence of research subjects; public or private institution al predominance; impact factor (IF); average citations per document per country; and frequency of published articles per journals per country. Brazil showed the highest number of published articles, followed by Argentina. Bolivia showed the highest number pub/number peo, followed by Peru. Most studied themes were physiology, orthopedic and rehabilitation. Public institutions showed a higher published articles number than did private institutions. Peru and Bolivia were the only countries with a mean IF of 2 or higher. Average citation was higher in Peru (higher coefficient variation). In conclusions, our results show that, in most South American countries, their published articles rate has increased over time. This could be related to new government and institutional policies. However, production was low compared with other areas of science."

More than 30 international organizations for cooperation currently operating in Latin America and the Caribbean were identified. Two groups of institutions with more than 60% similitude were established by the Bray-Curtis index, according to the countries of origin of member universities. Multivariate discriminant analysis revealed that variables measuring levels of affiliation are more effective in accounting for integration into a given group than those variables associated with coverage or past experience. These organizations show highly redundant and territorial concentration. The most recurrent management problems, evaluated by analyzing the content of documents and interviews, are related to: budgets, information and university culture. In spite of favorable conditions for internationalization, performance observed in international organizations for university cooperation reveal limited impact on higher education and academic development in Latin America and the Caribbean. © 2011 Nuffic."
130,3,"TITLE: Vertical handoff algorithms - A new approach for performance evaluation | KEYWORDS: Criticality analysis; Multicriteria evaluation; Performance evaluation; Vertical handoff; Wireless networks | ABSTRACT: A myriad of Vertical Handoff Algorithms (VHA) have been proposed by researchers and networks practitioners. These algorithms allow mobile terminals (MT) to maintain the network connection when they switch from one wireless network to another one. Given the amount of proposed VHA and the need for an objective assessment of these solutions different evaluation methodologies have been proposed, becoming the problem of evaluation of VHA in an interesting challenge. However, there is no consensus on how to evaluate performance of VHA. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a new approach for evaluating the VHA, which is based on multi -criteria evaluation and criticality analysis - a specific concept taken from the operational reliability. The new approach allows evaluating VHA using measured values of some defined parameters, which can be obtained from simulating VHA on a network simulation tool (e.g. NCTUns, NS -2, OMNET++, among others) or generic software simulation tools (e.g. MATLAB). As a test of the new model, an evaluation of five VHA is presented. ©2010 IEEE."

Two settings for national research grant competitions aimed at early-career scientists are introduced, namely the New Zealand Marsden award and the Chilean Fondecyt award. A framework of five constituent moves is formulated and 36 collected grant proposal abstracts are analyzed for their move-structure patterns and accompanying lexico-grammatical signals. A prototypical move-structure pattern is formulated and exemplified with abstracts from both settings and different disciplines, while key variations on this prototypical pattern are also described and analyzed. The findings suggest that a majority of abstracts are near-prototypical in structure (i.e., showing a single variation on a shared prototype) and therefore collectively maintain and reinforce this prototypical pattern as a common reference even as they individually diverge from it for their own rhetorical purposes."

Evaluating Self-medication Practices among Ecuadorian Adults During COVID-19 Lockdown | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; Hazard-risk-assessment-score; High risk; Lockdown; Self diagnosed disorder; Self-medication | ABSTRACT: Background: Self-medication involves using drugs to treat self-diagnosed disorders or symptoms. According to WHO, it is associated with a high risk among the general population, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This study aimed to assess self-medication practices, risks, and severity index among Ecuadorian adults during the first COVID-19 lockdown period in April 2020, using a descriptive non-experimental research design and a hazard risk assessment score analysis. Material and Methods: A descriptive non-experimental research design was used to assess self-medication practices, risk, and severity index among 364 Ecuadorian adults during the first COVID-19 lockdown period in April 2020. The study utilized an online survey and Hazard-Risk-Assessment-Score (HRAS) analysis of clinically relevant questions. Descriptive statistics were mainly used, integrating Chi-square and ANOVA analysis using R. Results: Despite a high level of education among the surveyed population, there was a significant risk of medication-related problems, with 63.1% and 26.72% of respondents at the third and fourth risk levels, respectively. Furthermore, 55% were at severe risk of self-medication, while 35% opted for medication therapies recommended on television, social media, or by influencers instead of consulting health professionals. Another 39% took medication before receiving recommendations from a doctor or pharmacist. Conclusion: The study highlights the need to improve the image of pharmaceutical chemists as part of multidisciplinary health teams, monitor prescriptions of the doctors, and reduce drug side effects to mitigate the risks associated with self-medication."
135,-1,"TITLE: How Can Courts Encourage Constitutional Replacement? | KEYWORDS: Chile; constitution-making; constitutional change; constitutional courts; judicial behavior; political polarization | ABSTRACT: Courts often do not play a significant role in constitutional replacement processes. Observers have identified exceptions and theorized about the courts’ possible functions during and after those processes. However, little has been said about the courts’ work taking place before replacement processes occur. This essay shows that courts can help establish the conditions for constitutional change by encouraging the demand for such change. They can do that by fostering the perception that the Constitution has become a tool to help one side of the political struggle win over politically salient constitutional conflicts, thus contributing to the polarization among competing political groups. Observers have reported that backlash against the courts is possible. I claim that a backlash against the Constitution itself is also possible. Encouraging the losers of the constitutional conflict to either attack the court or the constitution is possibly an unintended consequence of judges deciding cases in politically consequential ways. The implication is that strategic judges must balance the need to resolve cases in ways they perceive correct with the long-term acceptance of the Constitution. Still, a collective action problem makes this task difficult to achieve. The essay explores these ideas using different examples and expands on how the Chilean Constitutional Court contributed to building opposition against the Constitution before the Constitutional Convention was convened."

This article offers a cautionary approach to the way these participatory mechanisms work in constitution-making. In democratic contexts including populist narratives and representative institutions functioning in flawed ways, constitution-making can fail not simply despite the existence of participatory mechanisms but in part because of them. We identify two types of failures. First, the authoritarian failure, which consists of constitution-making processes that lead to authoritarian outcomes or become part of democratic backsliding or abusive processes. Second, the activation failure, by which constitutions are not passed. We claim that this later failure can likely occur when reforms attempt to bypass established, functioning institutional actors, whatever their flaws, and use a comparative approach to the Chilean Constitutional Convention (2021-2022) as an example."

145,-1,"TITLE: Is it time to abandon the theory of constituent power? | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: A group of scholars has shown that the theory of constituent power - which seeks to describe and justify the dismantling of the constitutional order and its replacement with a new constitution - is flawed. The analytical tools the theory deploys fail to explain how constitution-making processes unfold. Also, the theory has been subject to normative challenges that question its democratic nature. However, the theory remains a mainstream idea in many countries, and some academics have attempted to defend its democratic nature. I claim that those attempts have rendered the theory meaningless or failed to address all of its problems. I then raise two objections. First, the constituent power theory cannot be used to justify most - if any - constitution-making processes without an excessive idealization of the founding moment, but we are yet to understand the actual costs of that idealization. Second, redeemers of the theory need to decide whether constitution-making can operate under reasonably favorable electoral and democratic conditions or not. Ideal conditions are improbable when constitutional change is carried out in response to a crisis. In the unlikely case that these conditions can be met, using an idea of constitutional change as radical as the constituent power theory is not warranted from a normative perspective. I call this the dilemma of constituent power redemption."

147,21,"TITLE: How Political Narratives Affect the Self-Enforcing Nature of Interim Constitutions | KEYWORDS: Chile; Constitution-making; Constitutional enforcement; Interim constitutions | ABSTRACT: This essay seeks to contribute to the literature that asks how interim constitutions can become self-enforcing norms capable of producing a successful constitution-making process. It uses the Chilean constitution-making process as an example to theorize on how the political narratives associated with the November 2019 Agreement, which sets the framework for constitutional change, can influence its self-enforcing capacity. The authors identify and reconstruct the two prevailing normative theories underlying the Chilean constitution-making process: the evolutive and the revolutionary narratives. These present themselves in both radical and moderate versions. While evolutive ideas emphasize institutional continuity, consensus-building, and an incrementalist approach to constitutional change, revolutionary arguments rely on the constituent power theory and push for a profound social transformation that can break with the past. Even though these narratives are in tension with each other in many respects, they have both influenced the design of the rules of the constitution-making process. The authors claim that the self-enforcing capacity of the interim constitution partly depends on whether, and to what extent, the moderate versions of these narratives succeed or prevail in the political discourse."
148,21,"TITLE: How can constitutional review experiments fail? Lessons from the 1925 Chilean Constitution | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Constitutional designers establishing a new judicial review mechanism can fail to make that mechanism a relevant instrument for checking the power of incumbent legislators or presidents. Judges may refuse to exercise their newly established powers, politicians may refuse to obey their rulings, or the judiciary may be packed, among other possible reasons. The causes can be attributed to the existence of a dominant party system, the lack of political competition, problems of institutional design, or judicial culture. This article contributes to the understanding of this problem by exploring the failed constitutional mechanism that Chilean constitutional designers established in 1925. The 1925 Chilean Constitution established the power of judicial review of legislation for the first time in Chile's history, but the Supreme Court generally avoided to be involved in political battles. Chile had a competitive political system with frequent and regular rotation in power. The literature claims that, under these conditions, we should expect judges to be more independent and empowered, but this is not what happened in the Chilean case. Scholars studying this period of Chilean constitutional history generally associate the passivity of the Supreme Court with a legalistic culture promoting an apolitical and formalistic judicial behavior. This article claims that the narrative of judicial apoliticism served to justify, and perhaps to persuade, the Supreme Court's choice not to intervene in politics, but more attention needs to be given to the institutional weaknesses of the judiciary of that time and to the possible strategic judicial choice."

However, that observation does not mean that a theory justifying judicial review when a political market failure is identified is useless for examining both countries' judicial decisions. The author argues that an Ely-an procedural approach to judicial review can help justify or reject Chilean and Bolivian rulings - or judicial inactions - if certain conditions are taken into account to adapt Ely's theory to both jurisdictions."

Accordingly, some comparative constitutional law scholars argue that courts should develop strategies such as judicial avoidance or weak judicial review practices to prevent a clash with the governing regime. This Article proposes an alternative, suggesting that those strategies are unnecessary where courts are able to preserve or promote democratic values without incurring backlash. Where feasible, judges should prefer this case-specific confrontaional tactic to survival strategies, such as weak judicial review or constitutional avoidance. To succeed, judges must identify and predict the regime's expected costs of disobeying a judicial decision. If the projected costs are high enough, the regime's leaders might prefer to comply with the ruling. One way in which this judicial strategy can work is by triggering a constitutional paradox. This term describes the dilemma dictators face when they are forced to decide whether to support the constitutionally-rooted institutions they themselves have established, or to disobey the unfavorable decision while risking to divide the regime's supporting coalition, harm their own credibility, or weaken the legitimacy or authority of their regime's institutions. As a tool of judicial statecraft, the well-crafted paradox raises the costs to the regime of ignoring any single judicial decision, and those costs may be sufficiently high to pressure autocrats into acquiescence. This Article uses the Chilean Constitutional Court during the Pinochet Dictatorship (1973-1990) to show how the constitutional paradox can push dictators to respect adverse judicial rulings in high-stakes scenarios, and to identify the preliminary conditions in which judges may be able to successfully deploy this strategy against the regime."
151,21,"TITLE: The dual aversion of Chile's constitution-making process | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Chile initiated a constitution-making process in late 2019, after the major political parties signed an agreement to respond to the massive demonstrations that took over the streets in October of 2019. Dominant trends in Chile and Latin America's constitutional thought typically examine this type of process through the lenses of the constituent power or transformative constitutionalism. The authors of this essay offer a different view. They argue that Chile's constitution-making process, as designed by the multiparty agreement, manifests a double aversion: To avoid the Bolivarian way of constitution-making-including its associated constituent power narrative-and to put an end to the institutional and symbolic legacy of the Pinochet regime. In attempting to stay clear of these two negative models, the authors argue that the rules of the constitution-making process have adopted the main features of the post-sovereign model of constitution-making."

The analysis of near 200 appointments made in Chile between 1990 and 2016, shows that the heads of regulatory agencies chosen with the involvement of the Senate have similar levels of political affiliation, but better overall professional credentials compared to the results achieved by other institutional models. Our evidence also suggests that the tenure of those officers is two times longer, and it is three times more likely that they remain in office after the installation of a new government. The article provides useful evidence to advance the discussion about the impact of the institutional appointing models on the autonomy of those institutions. There is a significant correlation between formal and material independence of Chilean regulatory agencies, as well as showing the importance of the Senate in the system of check and balances for appointing regulators."
154,21,"TITLE: The fall of the Constitution's political insurance: How the Morales regime eliminated the insurance of the 2009 Bolivian Constitution | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Some scholars argue that constitutions may include an insurance that aims to protect the political rights of prospective electoral losers and prevents a dominant ruling coalition from undermining the competitiveness of the political system. Although some insurance scholars have recently paid more attention to the conditions that make an insurance more likely to be effective, the scholarship seeking to identify the limits of the insurance is still scarce. The literature on courts and democratization may help us to understand those limits by exploring successful and failed experiences. In this article, I argue that after constitution-makers agree to including an insurance, the incumbent regime may delay its implementation or, if the insurance is implemented, the regime may employ different political and legal strategies to eliminate it. I identify some of these strategies using examples from the Bolivian constitutional system. I argue that the Bolivian 2009 Constitution included an insurance and that the Evo Morales regime eliminated it with the help of the Constitutional Court. Although insurance theory expects constitutional courts to guarantee key institutional arrangements, the Bolivian experience shows that constitutional courts may in fact execute the opposite task, and that after constitution makers negotiate and approve an insurance, the challenge is to secure its implementation and survival."
155,21,"TITLE: The ALBA constitutional project and political representation | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: After the Cold War era, significant constitutional changes took place in Latin America. One distinct trend is the neo-Bolivarian constitutionalism, which has taken place in the ALBA countries, including the constitutional replacements of Venezuela (1999), Ecuador (2008), and Bolivia (2009). Many scholars have rightly criticized these constitutional experiments arguing that they have helped to deteriorate a liberal notion of democracy. This essay approaches a question that complements those criticisms from a different perspective: How the ALBA countries have resorted to varied notions of political representation. The authors use the classic work of Pitkin to identify the different sorts of political representation involved in the ALBA constitutional experiments, finding a combination of symbolic and descriptive representation. The former is linked to the figure of the president as a caudillo that centralizes political power, whereas the latter is fostered by both the president and the contents of the new constitutions related to the original peoples. As a result, the empowering purpose of constitutionalism has been preferred over its constraining purpose."

This article examines how the understudied Chilean 1970-1973 Constitutional Tribunal has contributed to this discussion. That Tribunal was created in 1970, through an error made by constitution-amenders who believed that someone else was going to be elected president. Although the Tribunal generally benefited the unexpectedly elected president (Allende), it finally lost its relevance because of its refusal to alleviate a significant political conflict. Judicial review theories based on rights and political competition are not applicable to the Chilean case. The separation of powers theory, which claims that constitutional courts develop because of their function in solving inter-branch disputes, partly explains the creation of the Tribunal. However, the Chilean example suggests that that theory does not apply in highly controversial contexts."

Un enroque entre jueces de carrera y académicos | KEYWORDS: Chilean constitutional tribunal; Dissenting opinions; Unanimous judicial opinions | ABSTRACT: After a constitutional amendment in 2005, the Chilean Constitutional Tribunal is becoming more active in exercising its powers against the executive branch. This effect is mainly due to a castling in the composition of the court between career judges and justices coming from the academia. Chilean judges have had a long-standing reputation of being deferential with the government and of following a rule of unanimity. That attitude, however, goes beyond partisan affiliation. As it is shown in this paper, the changes in the behavior of the court seems to be more related with a change in the underlying legal culture, than with differences in the partisan affiliation of the justices."
161,10,"TITLE: Democratic objection against judicial review of legislation institutional design alternatives and constitutional theories La discusión democrática sobre la revisión judicial de las leyes de diseño institucional y modelos constitucionales | KEYWORDS: Constitutional Democracy; Constitutional Justice; Judicial Review | ABSTRACT: This article reviews the argument through which judicial review of legislation approved by popularly elected bodies, based on the authority of judges who are in a position of preeminence on the other branches of government, is contrary to democracy. Taking Jeremy Waldron's argument as a central reference, the author discusses some of the assumptions on which the democratic objection of judicial review is elaborated. He argues that separating the notion of constitutional supremacy from the idea of judicial supremacy would allow building a model that overcomes the democratic problem. The author reviews some alternatives provided by institutional designs, and analyses the problem inside the civil law legal tradition. He concludes that the debate about the democratic legitimacy of judicial review is a dynamic discussion, and its foundation depends on the movement of some specifi c variables that the author proposes."

After clarifying its special juridical nature, he analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of this system of control, using national and foreign bibliography. The existence of a constitutional seal aggravates the disadvantages. Then, he dedicates a section to study the motivation of the judgments generated in this type of control, questioning its value. For such purposes he makes a theoretical and empirical study of the jurisprudence of the Chilean Constitutional Court in the last years."

These datasets are effective in providing insights into the lithospheric structure of the Earth. Gravity data from the satellite products CryoSat-2 and Jason-1 have been used to investigate the Gulf of Guinea sedimentary basins and structural lineaments in this under-explored marginal sea region through the application of various edge filters. Present-day filtering methods such as the analytical signal, tilt angle of the gradient amplitude, NTilt gradient amplitude and softsign function were evaluated for their performance on synthetic gravity anomalies with and without noise prior to their application to gravity data covering the Gulf of Guinea. The softsign filter outputs obtained from synthetic examples result in higher resolution and more explicit edges while preventing fictitious edges production in the findings. The results of the data interpretation disclosed deep-seated and shallow structural features within the Gulf of Guinea oriented mainly in the WNW-ESE, NW-SE, NE-SW and NNE-SSW directions and seen to be concentrated in the upper slope domain. This observation is in good agreement with the occurrence of drag folds and the apparent concentration of wrench faulting features across the ridge top and bordering the upper slope. These results bring new facts ruling our understanding of this atypical regional tectonic setting in close agreement with the NE–SW-striking Pelusium Megashear Zone."
165,0,"TITLE: Towards automatic analysis of science classroom talk: Focus on teacher questions | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: In this study, classroom interaction is addressed by using automatic speech recognition (ASR) for automatic analysis of teacher talk. Educational research on classroom interactions and talk is mainly based on manual analysis, which, although quite accurate, is time consuming and expensive. As there are already many ways to harness the power of automatic approaches to analyse the content of talk, the next step is the automatic detection of different types of talk. In this study, the latter includes the automatic detection of teacher questions and their differentiation into closed and open types. The data consists of ASR text outputs of 25 physics lessons on the same topic, each 90 minutes long, from 25 different science teachers. The interplay between human- and machine-led approaches resulted in promising steps taken towards automatization. Future possibilities for automatic analysis of classroom talk and the implications for teaching and learning are discussed."

Since CSCL also takes place in face-to-face interactions, we studied the automatic coding accuracy of manually transcribed face-to-face communication. We conducted our study in an authentic higher-education physics context where computer-supported collaborative inquiry-based learning (CSCIL) is a popular pedagogical approach. Since learners’ needs for support in CSCIL vary in the different inquiry phases (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, and discussion), we studied, first, how the coding accuracy of five computational models (based on word embeddings and deep neural networks with attention layers) differed in the various inquiry-based learning (IBL) phases when compared to human coding. Second, we investigated how the different features of the best performing computational model improved the coding accuracy. The study indicated that the accuracy of the best performing computational model (differentiated attention with pre-trained static embeddings) was slightly better than that of the human coder (58.9% vs. 54.3%). We also found that considering the previous and following utterances, as well as the relative position of the utterance, improved the model’s accuracy. Our method illustrates how computational models can be trained for specific purposes (e.g., to code IBL phases) with small data sets by using pre-trained models."

168,0,"TITLE: The effect of inhibitory control on general mathematics achievement and fraction comparison in middle school children | KEYWORDS: Fraction comparison; Inhibitory control; Mathematics achievement; Natural number bias; Numerical Stroop task; Visual priming | ABSTRACT: Individual differences in inhibitory control have been shown to relate to general mathematics achievement, but whether this relation varies for specific areas within mathematics is a question that remains open. Here, we evaluate if inhibitory processes play a specific role in the particular case of fraction comparison, where learners must ignore the potentially misleading information provided by the natural numbers composing fractions (e.g. 2/3 > 4/7 despite 2 < 4 and 3 < 7). To do this, we presented a sample of Chilean children (N = 450) from 5th, 6th, and 7th grade with a numerical comparison task tapping inhibitory and other processes. Results showed that both general math achievement and accuracy in comparing fractions were significantly predicted by inhibition. The former association, however, turned out to mediate the latter one. Another process, related to visual priming, predicted children’s likelihood to answer fraction comparison items focusing exclusively on the fraction components. This relation was, furthermore, not mediated by general math achievement. Altogether, these findings shed light on the mental processes underlying the early stages of the learning of fractions."

The students in one group watched a 15-minute video teaching them how to solve five different first-degree linear equations using a traditional symbolic strategy, while in the other group, the students watched a 15-minute video teaching them how to solve the same equations using four analogies for solving an equation: a two-pan balance for the equals sign, a box for a variable, candies for numbers, and guessing the number of candies inside a box. The students were then tested on 12 equation solving problems, all of them written, using only symbolic notation. The group that watched the analogies video performed significantly better. Students with a below-average mathematics GPA who watched the analogies video did as well as students with an above-average GPA who watched the symbolic strategy video. Students who watched the analogies video also reached a better conceptual understanding, were better at making generalizations, did significantly better on reasoning problems involving equations, and had a better affective reaction. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."

This article seeks to understand how these practices have evolved over recent decades. Methodology: This study first draws on an original database encompassing all empirical articles from twenty-two Latin American political science journals and six Latin Americanist journals published between 2010 and 2022. It then examines two prototypical case studies based on secondary literature and press reviews. Conclusions: This article puts forward two main arguments. On one hand, clientelism and vote buying are relatively understudied in the region’s leading journals, and there are distinct conceptual, methodological, and empirical approaches in Spanish- and English-language scholarship. On the other hand, the article argues that, with the weakening of Latin American political parties, the overall logic of particularistic ties in the region is shifting from party-based clientelism (as seen in Paraguay) toward vote buying through independent local leaders (as seen in Guatemala). Originality: This article contributes to the literature on the transformation of particularistic ties and how they are studied in Latin America. First, it provides an original content analysis of Latin American and Latin Americanist journals from 2010 to 2022. Second, it synthesizes the main features of clientelism and vote buying in Paraguay and Guatemala—two relatively understudied cases that, despite showing high levels of particularistic practices, serve as prototypical examples of these two phenomena."
172,-1,"TITLE: Mayors Unchecked: Vertical and Horizontal Dimensions of Local Autonomy in Latin American Municipalities | KEYWORDS: executive–legislative relations; Latin America; mayors; municipalities | ABSTRACT: In this paper, we argue that, relative to chief executives at higher levels of government, mayors in Latin America often operate with fewer outside checks on their scope of action, with problematic consequences for democracy. To make this argument, we examine a number of factors that can render mayors especially powerful and autonomous as political actors, and distinguish between the vertical (inter-governmental) and horizontal (inter-branch) dimensions of their autonomy. Vertically, we show that mayors have more institutional leeway than governors given the absence of the mechanism of interventions from the national government that could check their power. Horizontally, we identify a number of institutional and noninstitutional advantages that can enable mayors to exercise predominance vis-à-vis municipal legislative bodies and other actors in the local political landscape. To support our argument, we provide evidence gathered from fieldwork in six municipalities in three different countries (Chile, Paraguay, and Peru)."

While current research has focused almost exclusively on subnational regimes in federal states, existing theories face several limitations when “travelling” to the local level in unitary countries. The goal of this paper is to explain the continuity of local caudillos in office in urban settings. Contrary to the prevailing interaction-based explanations present in the literature, I propose a theoretical framework that focuses on local factors, the concept of local caudillo and the exercise of power (informal political practices). I argue that to secure their continuity in office, local caudillos need to pursue simultaneously three basic goals: foster their electoral base, control local political opposition, and neutralize other social and political actors. Based on extensive fieldwork, I illustrate this argument with a single-country study of one of the extreme cases of local caudillos, Vicky Barahona in Renca, Chile (2000–2016)."

Their role is crucial in the analysis of diverse national and local political phenomena. However, is this importance reflected in the study of subnational politics in Latin America? We argue that the analysis of subnational politics and particularly mayors has received a scant attention in Latin American Political Science research. Examining the production of 28 journals published in or focusing on Latin America between 2010 and 2022, we show that —with ample variation between the journals— only 6,59% of the almost 8,000 reviews articles focus on subnational politics and only 0,79% study the role of mayors in local politics. Using empirical examples from recent studies, we show why these findings are disconcerting."

We examine whether key dimensions of local democracy (election competitiveness, turnout, invalid voting, descriptive representation of women) are affected by the imposition of term limits. This article uses a quasi-experimental technique (difference-in-differences design) which leverages a unique and rare institutional reform in Chile that exogenously imposed term limits on some - but not all - mayors in 2020. The as-good-as random assignment of municipalities to either group allows to exploit comparisons which yield robust causal estimates. The overall contribution of term limits to local democracy has been positive because they promote electoral competition, the emergence of female candidates and voter participation, as well as reduce invalid voting rates."

El clientelismo en Paraguay: ¿Compra de votos o compra de participación electoral? | KEYWORDS: brokers; clientelismo; compra de participación electoral; Paraguay; partidos políticos | ABSTRACT: Clientelism in Paraguay is widespread and socially acknowledged by politicians and citizens. However, it is relatively understudied in the comparative literature. This article offers a qualitative, descriptive account of the main actors and logics of the clientelistic linkages between politicians and citizens in Paraguay, focusing on both long-term relations and practices deployed during electoral periods. The article argues that clientelism in Paraguay is anchored in territorial party structures, identification with the main political parties, and networks of brokers with ties to neighbors. During periods of electoral campaigns, particularistic exchanges intensify and culminate in turnout buying on election day. The article shows that in Paraguay, the relational and electoral parts of clientelism are inseparable, whereby the former conditions the latter. Thus, turnout buying stems from the relations built over long time periods. The research is based on in-depth interviews and fieldwork in four cities in the metropolitan area of Asunción."

While existing research posits important explanatory accounts of both these processes, both stages are often studied separately when the determinants of women’s descriptive representation are analyzed. This generates possible inferential issues, because one stage conditions the other and individual variables might pull in opposing directions in both stages. Drawing on a novel data set of mayoral elections in almost 10,000 municipalities across 15 Latin American countries, we build on existing research to identify the distinct components of glass ceilings at both stages, propose a methodological solution to this problem, illustrate how certain variables have different effects in each stage, and draw implications for theory building in the research on women’s descriptive representation."

Former president Horacio Cartes was elected as the new president of the governing ANR, and his candidate, Santiago Peña, won the ANR internal elections to become the ruling party’s presidential candidate in 2023. The article argues that in this context, the two traditional parties opted, paradoxically, for opposing strategies, albeit with strong personalistic elements in both cases. In a political system characterized by a combination of personalistic politics and strong party machines, Cartes achieved to dominate the political scene, despite accusations of corruption against him. We argue that he diverted the attention from the corruption charges to conservative anti-gender issues in the public agenda and used this discourse to win ANR internal elections in the second half of the year. We also show that the ossification of the Paraguayan party system had negative consequences for democracy in the country in 2022, related to the personalization of political parties, corruption scandals in politics, and increased public insecurity and drug trafficking. Although party system collapse is unlikely, we conclude the article by showing that Paraguay can offer some comparative lessons for democracy in other Latin American countries."
180,-1,"TITLE: Municipal size and local democracy: understanding the trade-off between participation and contestation in Latin America | KEYWORDS: Latin America; local democracy; Municipal size; participation; political competition | ABSTRACT: Municipal size affects local democracy through two mechanisms–participation and contestation. By drawing on national-level theories of democracy, this article identifies a necessary tradeoff: decreasing municipal size maximises the participatory dimension of local democracy but reduces the level of contestation, which is similarly crucial for a healthy democracy. Employing multilevel models that simultaneously account for national-level and local-level influences, this proposition is tested using a large dataset of over 9,000 municipalities in 15 Latin American countries with competitive local elections. The evidence supports the operation of such a tradeoff in a regional comparison, and single-country analyses suggest that it is present with varying force in most countries of the region."

This article argues that SSM can be enhanced by the use of Facebook in at least three ways. This social-networking site helps to address some of the inherent limitations of SSM by learning about local contexts and identifying principal political actors, by gathering background information about and establishing contact with them, and by triangulating information they provide and reaching out to additional key informants. Thus, this article shows how Facebook can provide leverage in overcoming the problem of biased samples and offers concrete empirical illustrations from research on local politics in Latin American countries."

This study argues that there is more diversity in the relations between officials of both levels, and that, in some cases, these relations are openly contentious. Four ideal types of relations are identified, based on political affiliation and type of relation, through the systematisation of 43 cases of major Argentine cities."

However, methodological advances have been rather limited. This article builds upon Snyder’s (Stud Comp Int Dev 36(1):93–110, 2001) subnational comparative method and extends its logic to the comparison of subnational units from different countries. It proposes a novel typology of multilevel research designs that focuses particularly on cross-national small-N analysis (CSNA). This research design offers three different logics of qualitative case selection to achieve a sound trade-off between internal and external validity. This article analyzes the advantages and limitations of the underlying logics of CSNA and illustrates their use with recent empirical research from Latin American countries. It concludes by highlighting its versatility and offers a series of best practices in order to produce more generalizable findings than the majority of single-country subnational comparisons."

The Peruvian state introduced a weak indigenous electoral quota, and its effects have varied across provinces. This article presents a typology that combines descriptive and substantive dimensions of political representation. Using a subnational comparative method, the four cases studied illustrate distinct dynamics. The article argues that these differing dynamics are explained by a combination of sociostructural variables (i.e., political articulation and cohesion of indigenous organizations as a result of a conflict) and individual variables (i.e., candidates' political capital). This article demonstrates how, even in an institutionally adverse environment that does not feature ethnic parties, both descriptive and substantive indigenous political representation can be achieved, and that these two dimensions are not necessarily related. The article is based on fieldwork and interviews with key provincial political actors."

We approach this puzzle by arguing that the relationship between the level of presidential election fragmentation and governability crises is curvilinear: both very low and very high effective numbers of presidential candidates increase the risk of governability crisis. We test this theoretical claim with ordered logit models drawing on a sample of 108 presidencies in Latin America between 1978 and 2013 and using an ordinal index of the intensity of crisis as the dependent variable. We explore the operation of the theorized causal mechanisms through case studies and argue that they are different at both extremes, high and low levels of fragmentation. Finally, we formulate implications for the design of presidential electoral rules drawing on the debate contrasting runoff and plurality rules."

Using a quasiexperimental research design based on a matching technique, the results show that compulsory voting does not have a significant impact on redistributive policies. Examining the experience of Latin America, where mandatory voting prevails along with high income inequality, the article argues that the empirical problem with Lijphart's argument lies in the implicit assumption that there is a programmatic linkage between politicians and voters. An alternative hypothesis is proposed, that the combination of high electoral participation and high inequality may be due to the prevalence of clientelistic linkage, frequent in democracies with weak institutions."

We propose an Internal Democracy Index (IDI) building on three basic dimensions: competitiveness, decentralization and inclusiveness to measure the levels of democracy of these processes. The IDI is applied to nine processes of presidential candidate selection in the three principal Mexican political parties - Partido Acción Nacional (PAN), Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) and Partido de la Revolución Democrática (PRD) - between 1999 and 2012. We show that PAN evidences highest levels of internal democracy, as compared to PRI and PRD, in particular, considering the levels of competitiveness. We argue that the IDI is useful to capture and compare the levels of internal democracy both synchronically and diachronically."

This paper argues that despite the confusion in the terminology, the term nationalization should be understood as homogeneity of electoral support across the territory and that a proper measure of nationalization should take into account four basic elements: party presence across the country, number of subnational units where it is measured, its magnitude and the size of the party. The revision of the literature dedicated to Latin American countries reveals that more case studies of longterm evolution of party systems and explanation of its changes and party-centred variables are necessary."

Using public opinion poll data concerning these two representative cases, this article shows that voter motivations were indeed different. In Uruguay, ideology and programmatic issues were more important, while in Bolivia the retrospective voting contributesmore to explain the vote for the left. In both cases, the voting patterns are also structured by social and geographic cleavages. Yet, after discussing the results in light of the secondary literature on other South American cases, it is argued that the classification in terms of “two lefts” does not hold considering the analysis of vote determinants. In methodological terms, the article uses binomial logistic regression and compares a series of statistical models."

From this theoretical framework, it follows that the risk prone will initiate legal proceedings more than those averse to it; that when the risk prone are sued, their propensity to risk does not decrease in the face of low variability chance of loss in comparison with previous chances of loss of greater variability; and that furthermore, they generate greater legal expenses than people of other risk profiles. The aforementioned causes greater social losses on increasing the negative externalities of litigation due to the greater divergence between its private and social benefits. The latter shall be examined regarding the issues of permanent courts and the possibility of reaching agreements."

In that regard, we do not seek to exhaust the debate as to whether economic analysis of law and efficiency criteria (for which content is acquired) enjoy recognition in the system of Civil Law or are admissible as decision criteria. The purpose of this article is more straightforward. We seek to indicate the reasons why in those civil proceedings in which efficiency is admissible as a decisional factor, the appropriate incentives are generated to internalize the cost of obtaining a favourable pronouncement, producing sufficient information to resolve the issues in which efficiency is recognised as a decisional factor. This leads to the discrediting of the habitual belief that efficiency demands that the proceedings generate enough information to make its recognition as a decisional factor impossible."

The negative effect of the crisis on exports is highly heterogeneous. The evidence shows that larger exporters, belonging to industries more dependent on overall credit, have suffered disproportionately more during the crisis in terms of export growth, but less in terms of entry and exit. This has important policy implications, as public policy aiming at stimulating trade credit may not be as effective if overarching credit conditions remain subdued. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

We use a large panel dataset with quarterly financial information for Chilean firms during the period 1996-2009. We find three main results. First, liquidity crises have had a negative and economically significant effect on cash holdings, but mainly for small firms; medium-sized and large firms have not been affected by liquidity crises. Second, liquidity crises reduce the ability of firms to adjust to optimal cash holdings. Finally, medium-sized firms are less able to adjust cash holdings compared to small and large firms. © 2012 Institute of Developing Economies."

Principals are key in mobilizing school transformation processes, fostering teacher capacities and motivations, and setting optimal organizational conditions to support teaching and learning. Previous studies have pointed out the importance of principal retention for the success of school improvement processes. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the area of talent management by proposing a model that could help explain and reduce principal attrition. Using the integrative literature review strategy, we have explored the last two decades (2001-2021) of publications on management retention. A total of 28 articles were analysed in depth, identifying 23 central variables that could explain the management decision to stay or withdraw from school. We organize these variables in a bioecological model, including individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and political dimensions. The results are an invitation to public policymakers, educational administrators and educational leaders to generate strategies to strengthen the retention of principals and directors. We conclude by presenting limitations and directions for future research."

Findings from a thematic analysis of 68 publications show that attention to prospective principals increased after the year 2000 and this was driven by four main concerns: underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities, principal supply and demand, the principalship as a school improvement lever, and the expansion of leadership posts in schools. Selected articles addressed three dimensions of the pathways before a person is first appointed to this post: (a) micro (individual’s agency), (b) meso (preparation of prospective principals), and (c) macro (policies shaping access to the post). Across time and countries, pathways to the principalship are resourced by individuals’ professional orientations and by contextual factors, formal pre-service preparation may be desirable but not always available or required, and policies frame a conceptualisation of the principalship that shapes the two previous dimensions. The internationalization of research on pathways to the principalship has brought to the forefront normative assumptions that should be critically challenged when considering how to recruit, develop, and support prospective school principals."

School improvement is a complex endeavour—a complexity that is intensified for newly appointed principals, particularly when placed in a high-poverty, ineffective school. This article explores changes introduced by newly appointed principals placed in elementary public schools that were struggling (n = 4) and in schools that were sinking (n = 5). Findings show that all participants converged on actions to promote changes in: staffing, redesigning the organisation, and managing instruction. The quality of the actions, however, differed by type of school, highlighting the importance of defining policies for strengthening school leadership that take into account differences among schools. Induction will provide needed support at the individual level, but it might be insufficient support if other measures at the district level fail to create conditions, such as staffing, so the arrival of a new principal is indeed an opportunity to reverse a downward trajectory of an ineffective, high-poverty school."

While, there is increasing evidence addressing the lack of interest in the principalship, training and preparation has been identified as a potential enhancer for principalship interest. The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyse the relation between teacher’s interest in assuming a principalship and leadership preparation using a quantitative approach. A sample of 220 school teachers with no formal leadership responsibilities responded an online survey and their answers were analysed with descriptive, Pearson correlation and analysis of variance statistics. The findings indicated that age, professional training and opportunities to exercise leadership were relevant variables in understanding the level of interest of teachers. Implications for research and practice are discussed."

The aim of this study was to understand the challenges that school leaders face as they per form their work, the nature of the context in which these challenges arise, the strategies school leaders adopt to deal with the complexities of their work and the reasons behind these strategies. For this purpose, we investigated a single case study of a Chilean K8 school achieving extraordinary success despite its adverse circumstances. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with the principal, the vice-principal, the teachers, the students and the management team of the school. The interviews were focused on the challenges experienced by the school community, and on the strategies implemented in order to face them. The findings are organized around three key themes: first, the importance of nurturing high expectations among students and staff; secondly, the importance of enhancing teachers’ morale; thirdly, the importance of setting and sharing a common vision for a preferred future. These key themes have been instrumental to the success of the school may be enlightening to other schools, that are facing comparable challenging circumstances, especially in Chile."

In this paper we exemplify how a structural problem (public schools’ declining enrollment) created by neoliberal educational policies is transformed into an individual problem to be managed by the public school principal. Principals must sign a performance-based contract that specifies sanctions and incentives for meeting enrollment targets. The current paper examines, through data produced by in-depth interviews and shadowing, how 19 principals worked target. Findings show that to manage enrollment principals spent, on average, 24% of their time performing marketing tasks. Principals, thus, have developed an entrepreneurial self, which is promoted by quasi-market school governance models. Through this entrepreneurship they manage various threats that represent barriers to the possibilities for meeting enrollment targets."

In the present work focused on Chile, we use a high-resolution (∼5 km) gridded product (CR2Met v2.0) to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution and trends of HWs. We analyze daily maximum temperatures (Tx) from late austral spring to early autumn (November to March) to evaluate the HWs behavior during 1980–2020, using three criteria: i) three consecutive days with Tx > 30°C, ii) three consecutive days with Tx > 90th percentile (P90), and iii) three consecutive days with Tx > 95th percentile (P95). We validated our results using HWs statistics based on eighteen official meteorological stations; this procedure revealed a coherence with gridded data mainly over the Central Valley and the Andes. Using the P90 threshold, we found upward trends across the Andes between 20° and 36°S (>1 events per decade), and in the Central Valley between 34° - 43°S (>0.75 events per decade). In addition, using the P90 and P95 thresholds, HWs exhibit upward trends (>1 and 0.5 events per decade, respectively) throughout most of Chile, including Andes and Patagonia. Moreover, using all thresholds, we found an increase in HW frequency during the 2011–2020 megadrought period (ranging from 1 to 4 HWs events/decade) in comparison to the previous period (1980–2010). Meteorological factors such as an increase in the frequency of Puelche (Föhn-like) winds are proposed as an amplifying mechanism of HWs in South-Central Chile."

For this reason, international organizations and States consider it a strategic activity for rural development and, accordingly, recent policies formulated in Chile have subscribed to some of these perspectives. There are currently multiple threats to honey bees and other pollinators, which are expressed differently in different countries. Consequently, the study of beekeeping policies is of utmost relevance. In this article, through the analysis of archives and bibliographic sources, a historical reconstruction of the beekeeping policies promoted in Chile between 1968 and 2022 is carried out. Four stages were identified according to institutional designs, thematic orientations and scales of application. It concludes with the main challenges detected for the study of these policies in the country."

In the marine environment in Chile, repeated fisher led new social movements have been raised regarding the need to create laws controlling marine pollution from combined coal power station/extraction complexes and realise participatory blue epistemic justice. A series of case studies from across Chile demonstrate the importance of integrating fisher observations of contamination. Interviews and participatory GIS shows how fisher communities LEK observations can be integrated from Quintero, Mejillones and Coronel, which help generalise about the participatory solutions to the impacts of other coastal industrial complexes. The social protests of 2020–2021 opened up a new space for environmental rights through a successful campaign for a new Chilean constitution, the importance of which is shown by the politization of the violence of these sacrificial zones locally and globally. Differently to the creation of the constitution by the neoliberal dictatorship, the participatory space afforded by a people’s constitution through a plebiscite means that environmental justice concerns can be implemented in concrete form."

218,4,"TITLE: Geomorphology of the Caracota Valley, Western Altiplano, Northern Chile | KEYWORDS: Altiplano; archaeology; Bofedales; Chile; Geomorphology | ABSTRACT: We present a detailed geomorphological characterisation of the Caracota Valley (18°49′S 69°11′W, 4200–4600 m) in the western Altiplano of Northern Chile. A complex pattern of Pleistocene and Early Holocene glacier activity is responsible for the today's landscape configuration. Wetlands and temporary lakes significantly characterise the Caracota Valley setting providing water sources and storage required for life in this semi-arid landscape. Non-glacial processes at low intensities through most of the Holocene evoked little changes to the glacial landscape configuration, even though alluvial, fluvial and aeolian processes locally caused some sediment redistribution. The geomorphological study is embedded into a geoarchaeological research project on early human occupation in the zone of the Salar de Surire, Northern Chile, at 18°50′S. The geomorphological map offers a base to frame future discussions on the links between cultural and geomorphological places formation, which is a necessary step to move beyond site scales and ethnographic assumptions in the region of interest."

We present the analysis of multiple lines of data associated to the so-called “Archaic-Formative transition” recovering from excavations carried out in the early 2010s. La Capilla 1’s material culture-which represents different social dimensions of these coastal communities related to food, technology and mortuary practices, are employed to interrogate the different activities that were carried out in the site. Furthermore, identifying the areas of procurement of diverse ranges of resources enables us to indicate the networks of mobility and social interactions. In summary, by considering a new set of data and chronology, we broaden the set of activities previously identified on the site emphasizing the relevance of coastal and littoral environments had to the local coastal communities during the transition to the Formative Period in terms of their mobility and/or interaction networks with other populations settled in interior environments of the region."

Defined in general based on references from other developmental nuclei, such as the coastal valleys or the high plateau, the local Formative is evaluated and discussed in light of the data obtained from three archaeological locations: Pampa El Muerto, Pampa Oxaya and Mullipungo. We suggest the continuity of mobile groups with a hunting-gathering way of life, who would have progressively incorporated ceramics and the management of animal resources, as evidenced by rock art. Consequently, the existence of a particular local historical trajectory during the Formative times is proposed for the Precordillera of Arica, in the South-Central Andes."

In addition, we seek to assess the existence of possible temporal variations of intra-site activities in order to obtain a diachronic and comparative perspective of the social dynamics(s) that occurred there. These results constitute a synthetic reassessment of the area after studies conducted in the 1980s."

Techno-typological analysis such as the one presented here, try to show that lithic morphologies are not static as they vary in relation to their use, maintenance and recycling. In this study we explore and characterize the technological and typological variability of stone tools from Ipilla 2, an Early Archaic open-air camp (9,670-9,541 cal. BP) located in the Andes of Arica (3,400 m asl), northern Chile. The results show that tools were intensely maintained to extend their use-life, which transformed their original designs. Another technological process included the sequential manufacture of different edges in the same instrument. These results contribute to understanding the lifestyles of Andean hunter-gatherer societies and show that methodologically, lithic typologies must be considered from a dynamic perspective to become a more effective analytic tool."

Yet, important areas such as the Atacama Desert, between latitude 17 o to 21 o S (northern Atacama), lack occupations older than 11,5 ka. Current hyperarid conditions in the Atacama have dissuaded many researchers from considering this region as a possible territory for Pleistocene-Holocene peoples. Paleoecological data, however, have suggested increased availability of water along the western slope of the Andes from 17.5-9.5 ka. Thus, we systematically searched for rodent middens and paleowetlands in the large canyons of the Andean Precordillera as well as the interfluves (1,000-3,000 masl). As a result, we identified specific habitats favorable for early human settling. This interdisciplinary and predictive methodological model, summarized in this paper, allowed us to identify several sites. Among these, Quebrada Maní 12 is the first Pleistocene-Holocene human occupation (~11.9 a 12.7 ka) known from the northern Atacama."

We study the role of gender norms in perpetuating this violence by analyzing Holi, a festivity in India, where the phrase “Bura na mano Holi Hai” (Don't feel offended, it's Holi) is misused to justify inappropriate behavior. We document a 170% increase in assaults against women during Holi. Analysis reveals (1) higher violence in districts where men justify violence, and (2) a male backlash effect where women oppose it. Underreporting and reduced mobility during Holi do not appear to be the main drivers. To date, nobody has been convicted."

I study judicial discrimination in the world's largest democracy, India, by analyzing whether pending criminal cases against politicians who marginally win their election are more likely to be closed without a conviction than cases against politicians who marginally lose their election. I find that winning office increases the chances of a favorable outcome only for politicians from the ruling party. Evidence suggests two main explanations for this result: (1) members of the legislative assemblies aligned with the ruling party misuse executive powers to manipulate prosecutors and police officers, and (2) witnesses turn hostile in high-profile criminal cases."

Does information affect candidates’ behavior? Using Brazilian elections and audits as an exogenous source of information, I show that (1) politicians respond to information by adapting political campaigns and public policy, and (2) the reaction depends on the information content. Both incumbent and challenger increase their campaign spending when detrimental information affects the incumbent’s reputation. Conversely, beneficial information decreases candidates’ spending. As information affects the expected competitiveness of elections, candidates adapt their spending accordingly. Yet, only information disclosed before electoral campaigns impacts spending. Furthermore, incumbents also adapt a conditional cash transfers program by increasing (decreasing) the beneficiaries when detrimental (beneficial) reputation shocks occur. The results shed light on how and when politicians react to different information shocks."

229,5,"TITLE: The heterogeneous effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on crime across the world | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; Crime; Cross-national; Strict lockdown; Synthetic control | ABSTRACT: There is a vast literature evaluating the empirical association between stay-at-home policies and crime during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these academic efforts have primarily focused on the effects within specific cities or regions rather than adopting a cross-national comparative approach. Moreover, this body of literature not only generally lacks causal estimates but also has overlooked possible heterogeneities across different levels of stringency in mobility restrictions. This paper exploits the spatial and temporal variation of government responses to the pandemic in 45 cities across five continents to identify the causal impact of strict lockdown policies on the number of offenses reported to local police. We find that cities that implemented strict lockdowns experienced larger declines in some crime types (robbery, burglary, vehicle theft) but not others (assault, theft, homicide). This decline in crime rates attributed to more stringent policy responses represents only a small proportion of the effects documented in the literature."

At the same time, it seeks to account for the degrees of use of the analytical perspectives outlined by Karl Marx and Marxism in the mentioned works referring to education. We have been able to verify that the selected publications make little reference to contributions of Marx's work and Marxism, addressing issues of the history of education, educational policies, student and teacher movements, but without developing or use the pedagogical dimension of Marxism and even, some of them, reproducing in an uncritical way the hegemonic conceptions in education. To carry out this bibliographic balance, were reviewed recent editions of the journals Actuel Marx/Interventions, Izquierdas, La Migraña. Revista de análisis político, Herramienta. Revista de debate y crítica marxista, y Memoria. Revista de crítica militante. In methodological terms, was chosen a qualitative work based on the bibliographic analysis of academic journals and particularly an analysis of thematic content of the selected articles."

Data were recorded at the undergraduate EFL training programme at Universidad Austral de Chile in Valdivia, Chile, and were analysed through Multimodal Conversation Analysis. A workshop on Interactional Competence and Interactional Awareness was carried out with the participating Pre-Service Teachers (PSTs) applying the Self-Evaluation of Teacher Talk (SETT) framework (Walsh, 2013) on their own performance. Finally, structured interviews were held to identify the PSTs' experiences with the framework and its relevance as a reflexive practice tool to recognise the ways they promote oracy among their language learners. Results showed that the pre-service teachers were able to give instructions and open the floor for participation but needed training on feedback provision as they mostly oriented towards activity completion. They identified interactional practices through SETT and provided critical reflections. During the interviews, they recognised teachers’ Classroom Interactional Competence as key to enhancing language learners’ competences. This study has implications for teacher education: It shows a practice-led method of training teachers in the way they use language to promote better interactions and, thereby, enhance learners’ language development along the different strands of oracy."
236,0,"TITLE: Designedly incomplete elicitations: teachers’ multimodal practices to mobilise student-next action in Chilean secondary EFL classrooms | KEYWORDS: Chilean EFL classooms; classroom interaction; conversation analysis; language teaching; student participation | ABSTRACT: Managing student participation is a key interactional and instructional task in any classroom. This is even more relevant in language classrooms, as students need to demonstrate understanding, knowledge and proficiency through the production of lexical, phrasal, clausal or sentential elements. Question-Answer-sequences have been the focus within the Initiation-Response-Feedback pattern; however, another kind of initiation is that of turns with incomplete turn-constructional-units which students need to complete in the next sequential slot. This study explores elicitations designed as incomplete in five secondary EFL classrooms in the South of Chile. Analysis follows a multimodal Conversation Analytic approach. Results show that teachers mobilise turn-completion not only through gaze and gestures to explicitly signal to students that the floor is open, but also to project turn completion and index the relevance of the teaching materials. This study contributes to the understanding of teachers’ practices to manage participation and the progression of the pedagogical project in general, and to previous research on designedly incomplete utterances, in particular."

CA is the systematic analysis of talk produced in everyday human interaction, that is, talk-in-interaction (Hutchby & Wooffitt, 2008). Since its origins in 1960s, the field has expanded tremendously: from telephone calls to video recordings in Multimodal CA (Mondada, 2018) and has made great impact in the way we explore classroom discourse from an interactional perspective. This paper will first present an overview of the historical development of language instruction comparing both cognitive and socio-interactionist perspectives. It will then introduce CA to readers and will explain its main analytic concepts before exemplifying the kinds of practices that become visible through this approach, such as the temporality of gestural productions and the practices teachers deploy to promote participation. The paper will end with more current perspectives by introducing two teacher training frameworks which have emerged from the application of CA to classroom discourse."

We provide polynomial-time algorithms for constructing such schedules for a k-way merge intersection, for constant k, and for a crossing intersection involving two-way traffic. We also show that the more general problem of scheduling autonomous platoons through an intersection that includes both a k-way merge, for non-constant k, and a crossing of two-way traffic is NP-complete."

This favors the hypothesis that pension fund withdrawals and government subsidies related to the health crisis have, to some extent, contributed to the shortage of formal labor in the construction sector. Based on estimations of the logit model, we found that rejection probability increased with work experience (approximated by the worker’s age). For example, the probability of not accepting a formal contract for a highly experienced worker, who withdrew funds from their mandatory private Pension Fund Administrator and received the EFI, increased by 28%. The figure is approximately 2.5 times the rejection probability of a worker with the same experience but without having received this additional income."
242,14,"TITLE: The response of housing construction to a copper price shock in chile (2009–2020) | KEYWORDS: Copper price; Housing construction; Real estate; Time series; VAR model | ABSTRACT: The copper price is a leading indicator of real estate activity. Price increases are statistically related to increasing numbers of applications for residential building permits. However, this reciprocity is not instantaneous as permit numbers lag price rises by 9 to 10 months. This dynamic is implicit in various transmission channels: from the first effects on investment plans and demand for durable goods due to better expectations from investors and consumers to the real impact of higher copper revenues on the economy’s aggregate production and demand (multiplier or second-round effect). In this paper, we proposed the impulse-response functions of a vector autoregressive model to capture the dynamic between the copper price and house building permits. Therefore, it would be expected that the recent copper price increase will boost construction and real estate activity. The effects could materialize this year and extend into early 2022."

While a considerable body of literature addresses the tourism-climate change nexus in (sub-)Arctic and European Alpine regions, little is known about the situation in South American high mountain and sub-Antarctic areas. Against this background, this perspective article presents a research agenda for cryotourism-climate change nexus from a South–North perspective. The initial step toward this objective was an 18-days research visit in Chile and Argentina during January and February 2024. Drawing upon our field notes, current literature and the latest developments in ice and snow-based tourism, we propose three key dimensions for a research agenda, namely: (a) tourism mobilities and southward spatial substitution, (b) socio-ecological implications of cryotourism for local communities, and (c) governance challenges for tourism stakeholders and policymakers. We contend that interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to tourism and climate change research are key aspects to account for the global nature of tourism mobility flows, and the interlinks between local and global processes and impacts of climatic environmental transformations."

Data were collected through ethnographic methods in Puerto Raúl Marín Balmaceda. By using the concepts of promoted area and democratic engagement taken from the Convivial Conservation approach, we show how a network of local actors along with the State, NGOs, and research centers have progressed in: (a) reconciling economically significant activities with marine conservation and (b) developing a form of governance organised by a Local Management Council. The case shows the capacity of local actors to define and organise a marine protected area through links and networks with public and private organisations reflecting both national and global transformations in marine conservation."

Centering in innovation and biotechnological enhancement, the concept promises a future that makes compatible continual economic growth with environmental sustainability. In practice, however, the blue bioeconomy still mostly an object of imagination than a reality. In this paper we analyze a leading cause for such lack of effectiveness: the reductionistic ways in which most blue bioeconomy proposals engage with the agencies of marine entities. Adopting an analytical frame from science and technology studies (STS), we understand the multiple strategies oriented to produce neat and simple versions of marine beings as forms of “pacification” that enable the transformation of these beings in commodities that could be easily traded in global markets, at the expense of their sociobiological complexity. To explore the ways in which pacification works, the paper analyzes current attempts at renovating the seaweed industry in Chile. Especially we analyze two policy proposals – one focused on turning seaweed into the basis of a blue carbon economy and the other centered on the potential of seaweed as high-end novel foods for export – showing how they produce a highly pacified versions of seaweed that bear little resemblance with the complex beings populating Chilean seas. Pacified seaweed comes handy for market-oriented policy proposals but tend to fare quite poorly beyond them."
246,8,"TITLE: Countering salmon farming expansion: Network-making power in a nomadic marine space | KEYWORDS: Marine nomadism; Maritory; Network-making power; Resistance; Spatial boundaries | ABSTRACT: Promoted by the state, and national and international companies, salmon farming has spread to the south of Chile over the last three decades. This expansion has been resisted by local groups as social and environmental impacts in expanded territories of production and processing have been identified. Informed by a counter-territorialisation and network theory lens, we analyse how strategies by the state and national and international companies to expand salmon aquaculture have been resisted by a global network led by the Indigenous nomadic Yagán people. Data was obtained through participant observation and interviews gathered during three periods of fieldwork in the Region of Magallanes. Our research shows how network-making power was employed to resist state territorialisation at sea to reconfigure spatial boundaries and power relations at the border of the Chilean state. These findings extend an understanding of marine counter-territorialisation and contribute to a reorientation of marine policies to recognise networked spatial claims and territorial rights of Indigenous people of the sea."
247,6,"TITLE: Contested mobilities in the maritory: Implications of boundary formation in a nomadic space | KEYWORDS: marine territorialisation; nomadism; Patagonia; Protected areas; spatial claims | ABSTRACT: The mobility of nomadic Indigenous people has been systematically constrained over time by states seeking control over peripheral spaces and people. This is evident in the case of the Kawésqar nomadic ‘people of the sea’ who have been subject to a century of attempts by the Chilean state to spatially fix their movements over both their terrestrial territories and marine ‘maritories’. In this paper, we show how Indigenous groups like the Kawésqar can challenge and even regain partial control over their maritory by using spatial instruments of the state. We argue that by using these instruments to remobilise, the Kawésqar have been empowered to demobilise other groups and marine related sectors, such as aquaculture. These findings can reorient public policy to be more sensitive to Indigenous space and mobility. Instead of focusing exclusively on the establishment of spatial boundaries to exclude Indigenous communities, they can be used as a means of empowering these communities to exert control over actors and sectors seeking to limit their mobility."

However, the literature has scarcely addressed aspects of mobility in governing nature-based tourism. Taking the case of the National Park Torres del Paine we explore three aspects of mobility in nature-based tourism using the concepts of routes, frictions, and rhythms. Our findings show that the movement of tourists challenges spatially bounded forms of governance. Instead, we argue, new mobility-sensitive forms of nature-based tourism governance are needed that can complement the use of fixed-boundary conservation enclosures."

The case of the Angachilla wetland, Valdivia-Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Self-organization; Social-ecological systems; Urban green commons; Wetlands | ABSTRACT: This article focuses on self-organizing processes in contested urban social-ecological systems. It analyzes a wetland conservation program and civic management effort in the Angachilla sector of the city of Valdivia, Chile in a 15-year time frame. The aim is to understand what triggers collective actions and self-organization in the attempts of preserving an urban green common. The study uses a qualitative approach based on action-research methodologies. It examines key variables influencing self-organizing processes; including social-environmental crises, governance vacuums, wetland valuation, and leadership. It also discusses collective strategies for the transformation of negative feedback loops, such as norms and regulations detrimental to wetland protection, and those related to resistance to change of wetland surface area due to unregulated urbanization. From an Urban Green Commons perspective, this work illustrates the complexity of dealing with contested nature, making it a resource difficult to govern collectively given all the different interests and values in place. It also shows that there have been successful periods of active wetland management that have influenced active democratic processes regarding land use and land use change in the city."

Evidence from Chilean fruit exports | KEYWORDS: Chile; Fruit trade; Gravity model; Nontariff barriers; Sanitary and phytosanitary regulations; Standards | ABSTRACT: Increasing awareness of food safety issues has led to intensive use of sanitary, phytosanitary and quality-related regulations and standards, imposing a burden on exporting countries worldwide. This study assesses the impact of such regulations and standards estimating a gravity model for Chilean fresh fruit exports that incorporates a stringency-perception index that comprises different dimensions of trade requirements. Our results suggest that an increase in stringency has a negative and substantial effect on exported volumes, and the reduction is higher if stringency increases in developed countries. Results also showed that different dimensions have different effects on trade. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

An exporter's perception approach | KEYWORDS: Food safety; Fresh fruit markets; Harmonization of standards; International trade | ABSTRACT: Harmonization of trade regulations and standards is perhaps the most contentious issue regarding export markets due to the impacts that it can have on trade. We determine the extent of harmonization as perceived by exporters with respect to the major Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPSs) and quality measures which Chile faces in 16 international fresh fruit markets. The methodology combined qualitative and quantitative techniques. First, the most relevant safety and quality standards and regulations were identified and ranked. Second, a representative sample of exporters was interviewed to assess their perceptions regarding the level of stringency across markets and time for selected regulations. Perceptions were ranked on a likert scale and based on this scale a stringency index was constructed. The results show that Chile faces regulations which can be grouped into the following categories: (i) phytosanitary measures; (ii) tolerance limits for pesticide residues and contaminants; (iii) hygiene requirements; (iv) labeling, marking and packaging; (v) product and process standards; and (vi) registration procedures and other import requirements. The number of regulations varied among countries, ranging from 13 to 3 out of the 14 considered in the study. The most stringent country among the sample as perceived by exporters was México, whereas the least stringent was Saudi Arabia. Additionally, exporters agreed that stringency has increased over time with an average of 15% between 2005 and 2009. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

From the united states to Andean countries Origem e consequências da guerra contra às drogas dos Estados Unidos aos países andinos | KEYWORDS: Criminal Policy; Mass Imprisonment; War on Drugs | ABSTRACT: This paper aims to study the War on Drugs and its consequences in the Andean countries (Colombia, Peru and Bolivia). It analyses the way in which the United States internationalization of a criminal political discourse, resulted on a punitivist ideology separated from human rights when responding to the drug problem in these countries. The study begins with an incursion into the legal, political and social aspects of the origin of the discourse of the War on Drugs in the United States and the Andean countries. It continues with the presentation of the results and the current state of the political response to coca cultivation in each of these countries. The work closes with an exposition of the most visible consequences of the war on drugs in the Andean countries, characterized by the increase in prison overcrowding, the selective criminal prosecution of marginalized groups and mass incarceration. Regarding the methodology, it uses the inductive rationale through the bibliographic search. Consequently, it characterizes the punitivisim discourse against drugs and the ideologies that support it as a response lacking rationality within the framework of a Social and Democratic Rule of Law, whose implementation in drug-producing countries has caused structural damage to the legitimacy of the democratic systems of these countries, especially with regard to the respect for fundamental rights. This paper offers a study on the War on Drugs and its consequences in the Andean countries (Colombia, Peru and Bolivia). In particular, the way in which the United States internationalized a criminal political discourse that resulted in the establishment of an exceptional criminal prosecution system without a minimum standard when it comes to the constitutional guarantee of due process. In a second moment, this study approaches the different strategies assumed by these countries once the United States abandoned direct military intervention in policies. The paper ends analysing the visible consequences of this process, characterized by the increase in prison overcrowding, the selective criminal prosecution of marginalized groups and mass incarceration are exposed."

To achieve that goal, the article describes the ascriptive use of language in the institutional sense. At the same time, this article highlights the differences that this thesis has with alternative positions elaborated by Criminal Law scholars. Finally, it is exposed how the theory of language can explain the objectivation of the content of the imputation of intent and the renunciation of the valuation of the mental states."

Specially, about the possibility of extending the application of the rule to a decrease in psychic response abilities, specifically, in no-consensual sexual intercourse within contexts of drugs and alcohol intoxication, or, in cases of deep sleep. Finally it aims at signaling specific concerns regarding the validity of consent given by adults with mental disorders that do not constitute insanity or suffering from ""battered person syndrome""."

The mens rea of most criminal offences are: intent or purposely (which is the mostculpable mental state), knowledge, recklessness, and criminal negligence. In the European legal system of criminal law, intention is a label used not only for cases of purposely or knowledge; it's also includes cases of what the Anglo-American legal systems of criminal law would call recklessness. After a review of the common-law concept of culpability, this research shows the concept of intention andthe others state of mind categories."

Real images (as opposed to computer generated images and drawings) of child pornography are seen as a permanent record of the victim's abuse, and its creation and distribution is considered a serious crime in the United States Federal Code. The possibility of such use for grooming purposes is often used as a justification for the criminalization of possession of child pornography as well as for the criminalization of the creation, execution, distribution and possession of computer generated pseudo-photographs. In fact, there has been a great deal of public attention to child pornography offenders in recent years, particularly with the emergence of the Internet and pornographic content that it has made available. A particularly salient question is whether child pornography offenders are likely to commit a sexual offense involving contact with a child. This paper describes the legislative development in the United States and most important current literature on what is known about the risk of individuals using the Internet to commit felonies of sexual abuse or sexual contact with minors."

However, Chile's motivations and ambitious push to reach carbon-neutrality are complicated by a backdrop of severe drought, climate change impacts (i.e., wildfires, tree mortality), and the use of industrial plantations as a mitigation strategy. This has become more evident as widespread and severe wildfires have impacted large areas of industrial plantations, transforming the land-use, land-use change, and forestry sector from a carbon sink to a net carbon source. Consequently, Chile must diversify its climate actions to achieve carbon-neutrality. Nature-based solutions, including wetlands-peatlands and oceans, represent alternative climate actions that can be implemented to tackle greenhouse gas emissions at a national level. Diversification, however, must guarantee Chile's long-term carbon sequestration capacity without compromising the ecological functionality of biodiverse tree-less habitats and native forest ecosystems."

261,0,"TITLE: Winds of change? Understandings about capacity-building among actors in the public education system in Chile | KEYWORDS: Capacity-building; educational reform; intermediate level; professional development, Chile | ABSTRACT: Capacity-building has been promoted by the central level in Chile, through a reform that resembles school districts, where the intermediate level is intended to provide pedagogical support for schools. However, this has proven to be challenging due to different visions about what capacity-building looks like and how it relates to school improvement. As part of a project that sought to adjust and validate a ‘Capacity-Building Model’ (MDC1), a qualitative and exploratory inquiry about understandings of capacity-building was carried out. Data was produced through individual and group interviews with 32 professionals from the central and intermediate levels. Findings reveal that actors’ perspectives about capacity-building establish a distinction between capacity and practice. Participants also hold a vision of capacity-building aligned with the notion of pedagogical facilitation. Additionally, interviewees’ accounts show diverse challenges that must be faced to develop capacities at schools: low staffing; professionals’ lack of professional development; postponement of pedagogical issues to attend infrastructure and resource needs; disarticulation between improvement policies; and difficulties in assessing the progress of capacities. This study provides insights gained from a country that is in an initial stage regarding capacity-building approach, contributing with relevant knowledge about opportunities and challenges for other educational systems."

Method. Key studies exploring the intersection of both phenomena in public schools are identified, the objectives of the reviewed studies are classified, and the studies are categorized according to their main bibliometric attributes, conceptual approximations to multiculturalism, and positions associated with leadership roles. The review considered 104 documents published in the last 25 years (1994-2019), employing the PRISMA methodology. Results. Results allow the identification of tendencies and challenges for educational research in this field, among which it stands out that most studies focus both on the discourses of school communities facing their problems and on the decision-making processes or actions conducted in these contexts. Likewise, it is noticeable that scientific production is concentrated in anglophone countries (68%), predominantly reporting studies carried out in the US. Similarly, a large proportion of studies address multiculturalism from perspectives centered in indigenous-related topics and identify leadership roles associated with directive/management teams. Conclusions. These results show the need for more studies in scarcely addressed dimensions, particularly considering multiculturalism from the perspective of gender or socioeconomic diversity, as well as addressing school leadership more decisively regarding the role of teachers, considering increasingly more diverse educational scenarios."
263,0,"TITLE: Pedagogical mentoring in Chilean schools: an innovative approach to teachers' professional learning | KEYWORDS: Chilean school context; Coaching; Collaborative professional development; Pedagogical mentoring; Teacher learning | ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the conditions and challenges that facilitate teacher professional learning through the implementation of pedagogical mentoring (PM) within the Chilean school context. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a qualitative methods approach, utilizing an instrumental case study. As the primary data source, researchers conducted 14 individual, semistructured interviews. Participants included two comentors, six mentor teachers and six mentee teachers from two K-8 focal school sites. Data were examined using the content analysis method. Findings: Results revealed five aspects that contributed to PM's execution: the voluntary participation model, the reflective emphasis, the focus on teaching and learning, the facilitating role of the principal and comentor support. At the same time, the findings indicated three factors that hindered PM's success: interruptions due to schedule conflicts, limited dissemination throughout the school community and assimilation of the values embedded in the Chilean teacher evaluation system. Practical implications: PM holds great potential for collaborative professional development and continuous improvement of teachers' instructional practices, drawing on their experiences and resources and leading to the strengthening sense of professionalism in teaching and in teachers' social esteem. Originality/value: This is the first research to address a formal PM project in Chile aimed specifically at in-service teachers. Previous projects in the country have focused on novice teachers. Unlike other initiatives in the region, this project does not focus on teacher induction but on capacity building within schools through collaborative work. This research also adopts an approach based on support for teachers' professional development, while in Chile the main policies currently focus on teacher evaluation."
264,0,"TITLE: A systematic review on multiculturalism and educational leadership: similarities and contrasts in knowledge production across societies | KEYWORDS: educational leadership; Multiculturalism; social justice; systematic review | ABSTRACT: The intersection of multiculturalism and educational leadership, under a Social Justice (SJ) framework to understand diversity and equity issues, has received major attention in the academic world internationally. However, few is known about commonalities and differences between societies within this intersection. To address this gap, we reviewed 215 indexed articles from main databases, following PRISMA procedures. Results detected most research conceptualises multiculturality as indigenism, ethnicity or race, and less often as gender, religion, and disabilities. Also, the understanding of leadership generally focuses on principals and empowered teachers within formal K-12 settings. Furthermore, we found the hegemony of Anglo-Saxon publications, even among non-English speaking countries, giving insights of academic colonialism. We concluded the relevance of the relationship of educational leadership with multiculturalism as a research+development agenda. To reach equity and develop SJ inside of several diversity understandings, educational leaders need to address broad communities by a culturally sensitive leadership."
265,0,"TITLE: Ethical practice: A study of Chilean school leaders | KEYWORDS: Chile; Ethics; Leadership; Leadership development; Management development; Schools | ABSTRACT: Purpose: This article seeks to report on a research inquiry that explored the educational praxis of ethical school leaders in Chile. Behaving ethically is an imperative for school leaders. Being an ethical educational leader is something different. It is not only about behaving according to standards, but also rather involves an ethical way of being that engages the leader holistically in their attempt to do the right thing for students. Design/methodology/approach: A multiple case study design was employed to gain insight into the feelings, beliefs and thoughts of ethical school leaders in Chile regarding their educational experiences. To this end, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight identified ethical school leaders. The data focused on the commonalities and uniqueness within and across participants. Findings: Six main themes that reflect the experience of being ethical as a school leader in Chile were identified and included: holding personal and professional ethics as inseparable; ""consistently"" inspiring practice; valuing others; sustaining a humane view of education; being sensitive to the complex local context; and leading as serving. Originality/value: Ethical leaders in education have been shown to influence educational contexts from a moral imperative that is grounded in a critical and humanistic concern that deeply affirms ""others"" as a common good. Becoming and being an ethical leader is indeed an experiential journey that integrates the leader's personal and professional way of being. The findings provide key elements of ethical leadership within a Chilean school context that can influence current and future school leaders' practices and professional development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Los caminos a Valparaíso en 2009 | KEYWORDS: Challengers; Chilean congressional elections 2009; Congress; Electoral campaigns; Electoral expenses; Incumbents | ABSTRACT: In this research note we present the characteristics of twenty-six congressional electoral campaigns during the 2009 Chilean national elections and then use them to create a typology of campaign types for incumbents and challengers. The evidence was collected through participant observation and in-depth interviewing with key actors in each district. The statistical and Boolean analysis of these data yields the following results: different campaign profiles exist among incumbents and challengers; incumbents are the most successful candidates; higher amounts of electoral expenses increase the odds to win the district's seat; there is a generalized decrease in the use of party-symbols in campaigns.
267,0,"TITLE: It is not just your opinion. gender equity endorsement of Latin American students and their peers at school | KEYWORDS: Adolescents; Gender equity; Large-scale assessment; Sustainable developmental goals (SDG) | ABSTRACT: Promoting adhesion to attitudes toward gender equity is critical to achieving more equal societies, yet endorsement of gender equality among Latin American adolescents remains lower than global averages. This study investigates the role of school environments, civic knowledge, and authoritarianism in shaping gender equity attitudes among 8th-grade students in Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Peru, using data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2016. Fitting different regression models, we explore the relationships between individual socioeconomic status, classroom practices, and school-wide ideological climates on gender equity endorsement. Findings highlight the pivotal influence of civic knowledge and open classroom discussions as protective factors against authoritarian beliefs, which are negatively associated with gender equity support at both individual and contextual levels. Moreover, peer-group ideological climates significantly shape student attitudes, demonstrating the importance of school environments in fostering or hindering egalitarian beliefs. We discussed the role of school practices in the promotion of gender equity. These findings contribute to the global goal of citizenship education and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), particularly Goal 5, emphasising the role of schools in promoting democratic and gender-equitable values."
268,0,"TITLE: Is validation a luxury or an indispensable asset for educational assessment systems? | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Educational assessment and testing systems have become increasingly important in Latin America and their results are used for various purposes. However, are different interpretations and uses of these results appropriate? The content presented in this chapter introduces the current definition of validity, based primarily on the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (American Educational Research Association et al., 2014), and argues that validation should be a fundamental process in educational assessment and measurement systems to ensure legitimate interpretations and uses of their results. At the beginning of the chapter, the current concept of validity and validation is defined. The historical evolution of these concepts is then briefly reviewed, taking into account the contributions of Messick, Cronbach, and Kane. Subsequently, the types of validity evidence that can be part of a validation process are described: (a) evidence based on test content, (b) on response processes, (c) on internal structure, (d) on relations to other variables, and (e) on intended and unintended consequences. The chapter also explains how these different pieces of evidence should be integrated into a validity argument. Finally, the political dimension of validation is explained, pointing out the main difficulties encountered when research, policy, and practice converge as a validation agenda is created."

University students in 29 samples from 24 nations used a simple measure to rate their perceptions of the interpersonal cultural logic characterizing their local culture. The nomological net of these measures was then explored. Key dependent measures included three different facets of independent versus interdependent self-construal, relevant attitudes and values, reported handling of actual interpersonal conflicts, and responses to normative settings. Multilevel analyses revealed both individual- and sample-level effects but the dignity measure showed more individual-level effects, whereas sample-level effects were relatively more important with the face measure. The implications of this contrast are discussed."
270,2,"TITLE: Sex Differences in Self-Construal and in Depressive Symptoms: Predictors of Cross-National Variation | KEYWORDS: gender differences; gender equality; independence versus interdependence; religiosity; self-construal | ABSTRACT: Sex differences in aspects of independent versus interdependent self-construal and depressive symptoms were surveyed among 5,320 students from 24 nations. Men were found to perceive themselves as more self-contained whereas women perceived themselves as more connected to others. No significant sex differences were found on two further dimensions of self-construal, or on a measure of depressive symptoms. Multilevel modeling was used to test the ability of a series of predictors derived from a social identity perspective and from evolutionary theory to moderate sex differences. Contrary to most prior studies of personality, sex differences in self-construal were larger in samples from nations scoring lower on the Gender Gap Index, and the Human Development Index. Sex differences were also greater in nations with higher pathogen prevalence, higher self-reported religiosity, and in nations with high reported avoidance of settings with strong norms. The findings are discussed in terms of the interrelatedness of self-construals and the cultural contexts in which they are elicited and the distinctiveness of student samples."
271,0,"TITLE: Contextualism as an important facet of individualism-collectivism: Personhood beliefs across 37 national groups | KEYWORDS: cross-cultural differences; individualism-collectivism; measurement invariance; personhood beliefs | ABSTRACT: Beliefs about personhood are understood to be a defining feature of individualism-collectivism (I-C), but they have been insufficiently explored, given the emphasis of research on values and self-construals. We propose the construct of contextualism, referring to beliefs about the importance of context in understanding people, as a facet of cultural collectivism. A brief measure was developed and refined across 19 nations (Study 1: N = 5,241), showing good psychometric properties for cross-cultural use and correlating well at the nation level with other supposed facets and indicators of I-C. In Study 2 (N = 8,652), nation-level contextualism predicted ingroup favoritism, corruption, and differential trust of ingroup and outgroup members, while controlling for other facets of I-C, across 35 nations. We conclude that contextualism is an important part of cultural collectivism. This highlights the importance of beliefs alongside values and self-representations and contributes to a wider understanding of cultural processes. © The Author(s) 2013."

Various studies indicate inequalities in this regard. Wealthier people and women tend to exhibit greater pro-environmental attitudes and behavior. Moreover, literature on political socialization literature emphasizes the significant influence of families in shaping sociopolitical attitudes. This influence is particularly notable in aspects of social position and academic orientation. Hence, the study of willingness to act pro-environmentally must consider the potential gaps shaped by gender and socioeconomic status. In this chapter, students’ willingness to make personal efforts to protect the environment is assessed in relation to three main factors: students’ gender, parental education, and family scholarly culture (as indicated by the availability of more than 100 books at home). Additionally, immigration background was taken into account. International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2016 data were used and fitted to a series of ordinal logit models, assessing students’ willingness to act pro-environmentally in relation to these three factors. Results showed significant gaps: girls, students from more educated families, and students from more scholarly cultured families tend to display a higher willingness to act pro-environmentally."
273,0,"TITLE: Authoritative school climate as a context for civic socialization | KEYWORDS: Authoritative school climate; Civic engagement; School belonging; Student participation | ABSTRACT: This study represents a confirmatory attempt to classify schools based on the Authoritative Socialization Theory and test whether schools' classification is invariant across different structural characteristics of schools. Furthermore, it tests whether school typologies are related to school outcomes such as school violence, sense of belonging, and student participation. Through latent class analysis and a multilevel modeling approach, we analyzed data from a representative national survey in 1322 Chilean schools. Consistent with authoritative socialization theory and previous research, a four-class model was retained by considering two school climate dimensions: disciplinary structure and student support. These classes were named authoritative, indifferent, authoritarian, and permissive based on theory. In addition, classes showed to be invariant between schools considering the school administration and the school's religiosity; however, regarding the school size, the model showed to be partially invariant. Finally, the school levels of violence and belonging showed the expected pattern considering the theory and previous evidence; however, the average student participation levels showed an unexpected pattern. We conclude that the proposed methodology to classify schools is helpful and offers some advantages to the current classification methods under this theoretical framework. In substantive terms, our results show that not all students have the same probability of experiencing a nurturing school climate within a school system such as the Chilean one characterized by high levels of school segregation."

In the case of the Global South, the pandemic has developed along with growing South-South migratory movements, becoming another key factor that might reinforce social conflict in increasingly multicultural areas as migrants have historically served as “scapegoats” for unexpected crises as a way to control and manage diversity. Chile is one of the main destination countries for migrants from the Latin American and Caribbean region, and COVID-19 outbreaks in migrant housing have intensified discrimination. In such a context, there is a need for understanding how the pandemic has potentially changed the way non-migrants perceive and interact with migrant neighbors. Drawing on the national social cohesion panel survey study ELSOC (2016–2021, N = 2,927) the aim is to analyze the changes in non-migrants' attitudes toward migrants—related to dimensions of social cohesion—over the last years and their relation with individual status and territorial factors. We argue that social cohesion in increasingly multicultural societies is partially threatened in times of crisis. The results indicate that after the pandemic, convivial attitudes toward Latin American migrants decreased. Chileans started perceiving them more negatively, particularly those respondents with lower educational levels and who live in increasingly multicultural neighborhoods with higher rates of migrant residents."
275,0,"TITLE: The meaning of citizenship: Identifying the beliefs of teachers responsible for citizenship education in Chile | KEYWORDS: Citizenship education; good citizenship; teachers’ beliefs; youth political participation | ABSTRACT: Based on evidence from a 2019 survey of a sample of Chilean secondary education teachers responsible for citizenship education, this article examines their beliefs regarding citizenship and how these beliefs relate to their justifications of both legal and illegal protest actions in a societal context of wide socio-political crisis and mobilization. Using exploratory factor analysis, two types of citizenship are identified as structuring the beliefs of teachers: duty-based citizenship, related to what the literature conceives of as a minimalist or personally responsible-type of citizen, and activism-based citizenship, or the citizen type defined in the literature as justice-oriented. Then, exploring bivariate correlations with teachers’ justification of different protest actions, we found that duty-based citizenship beliefs are related to a pattern in which protest (legal or illegal) is considered less justifiable, whereas activism-based beliefs correlate positively with a greater justification of both legal and illegal (blockades of streets and strikes) protest actions. We examine these findings, distinguishing between teachers’ beliefs and justifications as educators and as citizens, arguing that the context of socio-political crisis and mobilization is a key factor for interpreting the tensions and dilemmas of teaching citizenship in Chile."

This study focuses on the role adolescents’ citizenship self-efficacy plays in linking civic knowledge and classroom climate to civic engagement. We use data from 4838 Chilean students (Mage = 14.16) who participated in the International Civic and Citizenship Study (ICCS). Using structural equation modelling, a mediational model with multilevel clustering showed that civic knowledge positively affects formal participation, but not civil participation, while an open classroom climate increases both forms of engagement during adolescence. Citizenship self-efficacy mediates the relation between classroom climate and both types of participation. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design citizenship education curricula for youth who live in contexts of inequality."

As such, this edited book examines the meaning of citizenship in an era defined by monumental global change. Chapters from across both the Global South and North consider emerging formations of citizenship and citizen identities among children and youth in formal and non-formal education contexts, as well as the social and civic imaginaries and practices to which children and youth engage, both in and outside of schools. Rich empirical contributions from an international team of contributors call attention to the social, political, economic, and educational structures shaping the ways young people view citizenship and highlight the social and political agency of children and youth amid increasing issues of polarization, climate change, conflict, migration, extremism, and authoritarianism. The book ultimately identifies emergent forms of citizenship developing in formal and non-formal educational contexts, including those that unsettle the nation-state and democracy. Edited by a team of academics with backgrounds in education, citizenship, and youth studies, this book will appeal to scholars, researchers, and faculty who work across the broader field of youth civic engagement and democracy, as well as international and comparative education and citizenship."

280,0,"TITLE: Measuring attitudes towards gender equality in international tests: Implications for their validity | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Large-scale international studies focus most of their efforts on measuring knowledge as academic achievement. For this reason, more attitudinal instruments, such as questionnaires for students, teachers, and principals, are left in an instead auxiliary role. In the case of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2009, in addition to measuring civic knowledge as academic achievement, a series of relevant instruments are considered within the concept of citizenship, aimed at measuring attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours. To encourage the use of the ICCS database incorporates' variables built based on composite indices (estimated with Item Response Theory [IRT]) of those scales that address the same issue, such as trust in institutions, participation, school climate, attitudes towards ethnic minorities, among others. Frequently ICCS's variables are used as they come in the database without stopping to analyse or problematize the validity of these measurements and their consequences in terms of contrasting hypotheses. Using the scale of attitudes towards equal rights between men and women, this chapter begins by describing, in general terms, the characteristics of ICCS and then moves on to factor analyses that show the possible validity problems that can arise from the use of the scores proposed by ICCS. The conclusions address the implications in terms of validity."

More specifically, we examine whether measures that were developed regionally exhibit better psychometric properties than other measures that were designed to work in a larger and more diverse number of education systems. First, we test the invariance of socioeconomic status (SES) scales across all the countries participating in each study, and then, we run the same test including only Latin American countries. The results suggest that none of the SES scales are invariant at the scalar level among all the countries participating in each study, and therefore comparisons between nations should be made with caution. As for the second group of analyses, our results show that when the analysis is restricted to Latin American countries, the invariance levels improve considerably. Finally, the levels of invariance achieved by each scale in each study and for each group of countries are discussed, as well as the type of comparisons that can be made given these results."

These authors possess extensive experience in analyzing and publishing from these datasets. The chapter begins by describing their professional, academic, and personal involvement with IEA's civic education studies. This is followed by an analytical review of peer-reviewed articles, books, as well as research projects that included ICCS data as part of their empirical evidence. It also describes the people, institutions, and research teams that have been involved in these projects. The result of this review is divided into two sections: a characterization of the topics that have proven relevant for the region, and mapping of the specific overlaps between these topics and the contents of the ICCS datasets. Finally, there are specific suggestions that could contribute to raising the profile of ICCS as a key resource for the discourse on civic education in Latin America."
283,0,"TITLE: Young Citizens Participation: Empirical Testing of a Conceptual Model | KEYWORDS: citizenship participation; civic engagement; measurement development; measurement invariance | ABSTRACT: A growing body of literature from different disciplines addresses concepts and measurement of citizenship. The present article seeks to contribute to this field by examining the issue of youth citizenship from a comparative international perspective and proposing a simplified conceptual model that can be operationalized. This model includes a community dimension, which refers to individual’s relationship with their community associations, and a civic dimension, concerning institutional processes such as voting and/or political activism. The model was tested using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis and measurement equivalence for eighth-grade students (n = 139.875) across 38 countries that participated in the International Civic and Citizenship Study (2009). Our results find support for the proposed conceptual model and its invariance across countries, and we discuss the implications for theory and further research."
284,-1,"TITLE: When nonactivists care: Group efficacy mediates the effect of social identification and perceived instability on the legitimacy of collective action | KEYWORDS: collective action; group efficacy; legitimacy; perceived instability; social identity | ABSTRACT: In recent years, multiple social movements have emerged around the world. In addition, public surveys indicate the highest recorded levels of support for protest. In this context of acceptance of collective action, we examine the role of nonactivists in the perceived legitimacy of social movements, as this “passive” support can contribute to social change. Given that antecedents of legitimacy have been neglected in the literature, we carried out a survey (N = 605) among a general sample of the population in Chile to shed light on this issue. We found that social identification with movements and perceived instability predicted the perceived legitimacy of protests by social movements, and that both variables had only indirect effects through group efficacy. This suggests that perceiving social movements as able to achieve success can lead nonactivists to perceive their actions as legitimate, highlighting the importance to movements of being seen to be effective."

Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis is used to estimate a measurement model of the egalitarian attitudes and its measurement equivalence across the 38 countries (n = 140,000 8th grade students) that participated in ICCS 2009. The results indicate that the original scales are non-invariant. Nevertheless, with some modifications, the proposed conceptual model was found to be invariant across countries. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and empirical implications of the model."

Assuming that attitudes toward such social groups are at least partly learned during the political socialization of school-age children, this chapter explores individual differences in equal rights attitudes using data from the last International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2009 on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of eighth grade students from 38 countries. Using structural equations and multilevel models, the analysis estimates regression models using a set of measures, with family status being the main independent variable. The results show that there are large differences across countries regarding the level of inclusive attitudes, and that parental education and the number of books at home are relevant predictors of more inclusive attitudes of children in most of the countries analyzed; however, patterns differ by gender and immigrant groups. The findings are discussed, taking into account current and future political issues associated with migration and demands for equal rights."

289,0,"TITLE: Teaching Tolerance in a Globalized World: An Introduction | KEYWORDS: Diversity; Egalitarian attitudes; International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS); International large-scale assessments; Tolerance | ABSTRACT: The increasing diversity of student populations is a global educational trend. The relatively recent rapid influx of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, coupled with issues of increasing intolerance, social exclusion and feelings of alienation, and extremism among young people, are posing complex challenges for educational systems around the world. Education has a key role to play in preparing future generations to address these problems and ensuring that young people acquire the social, civic, and intercultural competences needed for active and successful participation in society. This book presents five empirical studies, designed to examine differing factors and conditions that may help schools and teachers in their endeavors to promote tolerance in a globalized world. The 2009 International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) provided the research data. This introductory chapter describes the overall theoretical framework, discusses key constructs, and outlines the aims guiding the five studies, concluding with an overview of all chapters."

Pensémoslo de nuevo: ¿podemos comparar las escalas de antecedentes socioeconómicos? | KEYWORDS: Confirmatory factor analysis; Socio-economic scales | ABSTRACT: Using data from international large-scale assessments (ILSA), we evaluate the issue of country-level model-data consistency of background socio-economic scales, as well as the invariance across countries. To that end, we use data from PISA, TERCE, and TIMSS, as they operationalize socio-economic status somewhat differently. As part of our analysis, we examine whether TERCE, a Latin American study – with measures that are regionally developed – exhibits better psychometric properties than measures that are designed to function across a larger and more diverse number of educational systems. We also examine TIMSS, a trends focused study – that has historically emphasized consistency and comparison. Finally, we include PISA which has the largest number of participants and has changed and conceptualized a great deal of its background questionnaire depending on the study’s major domain and focus. Our findings suggest that none of the socio-economic background scales we analyzed are fully invariant in any of the three studies, and therefore comparisons across countries should be done with caution. The different levels of equivalence reached by each scale in each study and the type of comparisons that can be made given these results (e.g., comparison of average scale scores, comparison of relationships between the tested scales and other variables) are discussed in the full paper."
291,0,"TITLE: Mitigating the political participation gap from the school: the roles of civic knowledge and classroom climate | KEYWORDS: citizenship; civic knowledge; classroom climate; political participation; social background | ABSTRACT: Empirical evidence has consistently shown that political participation is positively related with socioeconomic background. Furthermore, recent research suggests that children who come from low status families are already less willing to get politically involved. The present paper aims to analyze the possible impact that schools can have in mitigating the effect of parents' socioeconomic status on students' expected electoral participation, focusing on two variables: civic knowledge and classroom climate. The analyses are based on a series of multilevel models using Chilean data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2009. The results support the influence of students' socioeconomic background on expected electoral participation. Furthermore, civic knowledge and classroom climate show a positive and similar influence on students' expected participation. However, classroom climate appears less affected by students' background than civic knowledge, opening the discussion about which strategy should be emphasized when aiming to mitigate the political participation gap."
292,0,"TITLE: Social inequality and changes in students’ expected political participation in Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; citizenship; political participation; social inequality; social origin | ABSTRACT: To what extent does social origin impact the disposition of students toward becoming politically involved in their future adult life? Using Chilean data from Civic Education Study, 1999 (N = 5688), and International Civic and Citizenship Education Study, 2009 (N = 5192), the present research analyzes, on the one hand, the impact of socioeconomic variables on attitudes toward future political participation and, on the other hand, explores to what extent the association between social origin and participation has changed over time. The analysis is performed in a multilevel framework, to account for both family socioeconomic status and individual school characteristics. The results support the hypothesis that social origin continues to have a strong influence on students’ attitudes toward political participation, in the context of the two measurement points. The resulting discussion focuses on the role of schools in reducing socioeconomic differences, an issue that acquires additional relevance in societies with high inequality such as Chile."
293,-1,"TITLE: We are all middle class on subjective social status in Chile Todos somos de clase media sobre el estatus social subjetivo en Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Chile has one of the highest levels of income inequality among countries worldwide. Given the association between economic inequality and patterns of social stratification, in such a context one would expect to find a large dispersion of subjective social status indicators in the population. Nevertheless, analyses of international surveys reveal a strong tendency to the mean of subjective status, that is, distortions of subjective status in respect to objective status. The present research attempts to tackle this phenomenon for the Chilean case, with a focus on the influence of status and class variables on subjective status. We analyze Chilean data from the social inequality module of the 2009 International Social Survey Programme. The results indicate a strong tendency to the mean of subjective status in the population, particularly among those with higher objective status. © 2013 by the Latin American Studies Association."

La influencia de los recursos personales en las donaciones de dinero | KEYWORDS: Chile; Helping behavior; Money donations; Socioeconomic status; Solidarity | ABSTRACT: In the public discourse it is commonly assumed that Chile is a solidary country, an assumption that is mixed with the idea of homogeneity in the country as far as helping behavior and solidarity values is concerned. The present paper is aimed at challenging this homogeneity assumption by proposing that helping behavior is associated to personal resources, which at the same time are linked to the position in the social stratification structure. Using data from the Solidarity Survey implemented by the assessment center MIDE UC of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in 2009, the paper focuses on a specific type of helping behavior: money donations. The analysis centers on the influence of personal resources such as income, education and networks on this kind of donations. Results indicate that individuals with greater resources are more given to donate, whereby the educational level plays a key role."
295,18,"TITLE: Individual and Contextual Predictors of Sexual Orientation Disclosure: Two Studies with Chilean LGBT + University Students | KEYWORDS: disclosure; family; LGBTQ+; social support; university students | ABSTRACT: This paper reports two studies that tested sexual orientation, residence context (urban/rural, living with parents), and perceived social support as predictors of sexual orientation disclosure in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority (LGB+) university students in Chile. Samples comprised 268 participants for Study 1, and 160 for Study 2, who were cisgender, transgender, or nonbinary. All participants answered an online questionnaire with sociodemographic questions, a perceived social support scale, and a list of individuals to whom they disclosed their sexual orientation. In both studies, the predictors of sexual orientation disclosure were being gay or lesbian (vs. bisexual and other sexual minority individuals), not living with parents, and perceiving social support from others outside family and friends. Our findings show the need to expand the social understanding of sexual orientation beyond heterosexual-homosexual dichotomies, and to strengthen sources of social support in higher education to foster safer environments for sexual and gender minority students."

However, data on the extent to which workplace and family support, family-to-work conflict, and family satisfaction were linked during the COVID-19 pandemic for workers and their families is still limited. This study explored the actor and partner effects between perceived workplace support for families and perceived family support, family-to-work conflict, and family satisfaction, in different-sex dual-earner parents with adolescents and the mediating role of parents’ family-to-work conflict. In the Metropolitan Region of Chile, 430 dual-earner parents and their adolescent child (mean age of 12.8 years, 53.7% female) were recruited for the study. Mothers and fathers responded to measures of family-to-work conflict and perceived workplace support for families and the Perceived Family Support Scale. The three family members answered the Satisfaction with Family Life Scale. Analyses were conducted using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model and structural equation modeling. Results showed that mothers’ and fathers’ perceived workplace support for families and perceived family support helped reduce their family-to-work conflict; no other association involving parents’ perceived workplace support for families was significant. By contrast, direct actor and partner effects were found between parents’ perceived family support and the three family members’ family satisfaction. Family-to-work conflict showed two significant mediating roles: One intraindividual in fathers and one intraindividual from fathers to adolescents. These findings indicate that resources both parents gain from perceived family support positively affect the three family members’ family satisfaction by different mechanisms and underscore the importance of family support for family satisfaction during the pandemic."
297,18,"TITLE: Links between heteronormativity dimensions and life satisfaction in Chilean lesbian, gay and bisexual university students Vínculos entre las dimensiones de heteronormatividad y la satisfacción con la vida en estudiantes universitarios lesbianas, gays y bisexuales en Chile | KEYWORDS: Heteronormativity; life satisfaction; self-discrepancy; sexual minorities; university students | ABSTRACT: Introduction: Lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people can hold heteronormative attitudes and beliefs, which comprise assumptions regarding gender essentialism and men and women’s expected behaviours in relationships. In this population, adherence to heter-onormativity may increase a sense of discrepancy between the “current” and the “ought” self. This self-discrepancy, in turn, has a negative impact on life satisfaction. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between two dimensions of heteronormativity –gen-der essentialism and normative behaviours– and life satisfaction, both directly and mediated by self-discrepancy. Method: A sample of 232 LGB university students in Southern Chile an-swered an online questionnaire that included the Heteronormative Attitudes and Beliefs Scale, the Self-Discrepancy Index, and the Life Satisfaction Scale. Structural equation models were performed to test these relationships. Results: Gender essentialism and normative behaviour were negatively and positively associated with life satisfaction, respectively. Likewise, self-discrepancy was negatively linked to life satisfaction. The analysis showed no evidence for the mediating role of self-discrepancy in this model. Conclusion: LGB university students can adhere to different dimensions of heteronormativity, which in turn may relate differentially to life satisfaction."

This gap in knowledge is more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the documented increase in family responsibilities in detriment of work performance, particularly for women. Job satisfaction has been identified as a mediator between the family and work domains for the individual, but these family-to-work dynamics remain unexplored at a dyadic level during the pandemic. Therefore, this study tested the relationship between family-to-work conflict and job and family satisfaction, and the mediating role of job satisfaction between family-to-work conflict and family satisfaction, in dual-earner parents. A non-probability sample of 430 dual-earner parents with adolescent children were recruited in Rancagua, Chile. Mothers and fathers answered an online questionnaire with a measure of family-to-work conflict, the Job Satisfaction Scale and Satisfaction with Family Life Scale. Data was analysed using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model with structural equation modelling. Results showed that, for individuals, a higher family-to-work conflict is linked to lower satisfaction with both their job and family life, and these two types of satisfaction are positively associated with one another. Both parents experience a double negative effect on their family life satisfaction, due to their own, and to their partner’s family-to-work conflict; however, for fathers, this effect from their partner occurs via their own job satisfaction. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed, indicating the need of family-oriented workplace policies with a gender perspective to increase satisfaction in the family domain for workers and their families."

Method: Structural Equations were used to explore the relationships between work-family conflict, negative emotional symptoms and family satisfaction in women from dual-income families. Questionnaires were administered to 430 women with paid work with at least one adolescent child in Rancagua, Chile, who responded to the work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict dimensions of the Work-Family Interface Scale; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21); and the Satisfaction with Family Life Scale. Results: The work-family conflict, in both directions, was positively associated with negative emotional symptoms, which, in turn, were negatively related to family satisfaction. Family-to-work conflict was directly negatively related to family satisfaction, while negative emotional symptoms showed a mediating role between work-family conflict and family satisfaction. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, to improve family satisfaction in crisis situations, interventions are needed to mitigate work and family demands, as well as to ameliorate negative emotions such as depression, anxiety and stress in women with paid work."

In this study, direct and indirect relationships were explored between work-to-family conflict and work-to-family enrichment, job satisfaction, satisfaction with family life and satisfaction with life, in a sample of 473 women with paid work and adolescent children in Temuco, Chile. Using structural equation modelling, results showed that participants’ satisfaction with life was associated with their satisfaction in both work and family domains. Evidence was also found for underlying mechanisms explaining the relationship between work-to-family conflict and life satisfaction, and between work-to-family enrichment and life satisfaction. These findings contribute to organizational-level knowledge for designing practices and strategies to promote favourable conditions to increase women’s work-to-family enrichment."
301,18,TITLE: The association between transgender-related fiction and transnegativity: transportation and intergroup anxiety as mediators | KEYWORDS: fiction; Indirect contact; intergroup anxiety; prejudice; transnegativity | ABSTRACT: Fictional narratives can serve as an indirect contact strategy when direct contact between two groups is not feasible. This study investigated whether exposing cisgender individuals to transgender-related fiction was associated with reduced transnegativity. Two emotion-related mediators were examined in this relationship: transportation into the story (proximal to fiction exposure) and intergroup anxiety (proximal to contact theory). Cisgender participants (N = 84) viewed or read stories involving transgender characters or read a science article. Those who encountered transgender characters reported lower transnegativity than those who read the control story. Transportation into the story and intergroup anxiety serially mediated this relationship. The findings suggest conditions under which a fictional story can expand an audience’s social world and thereby serve as a strategy for prejudice reduction.

It is hypothesized that family support is a protective factor of the person’s life satisfaction, directly and through other variables such as family meals and satisfaction with family life. In this regard, the aim of this study was to examine the serial mediating role of the atmosphere of family meals and satisfaction with family life in the relationship between family support and satisfaction with life, in women and men with paid jobs. Method: The Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (family subscale), a measure of Atmosphere Scale of Family Meals and the Satisfaction with Family Life Scale were administered to a sample of 236 women and 236 men with paid jobs in Temuco, Chile. The statistical analysis considered a serial mediation model with a 95% Confidence Interval. Results: Family support and satisfaction with life significantly correlated with one another. In addition, a significant indirect effect of the atmosphere of family meals and satisfaction with family life was obtained in the relationship between family support and life satisfaction. The atmosphere of family meals and satisfaction with family life are serial mediators in the relationship between family support and life satisfaction in this group of workers. Conclusions: Results suggest that variables related to the family domain and to social aspects of food consumption have a positive impact in workers’ life satisfaction."

Moreover, the children’s perceptions of this conflict contribute to shaping the family dynamics, which in turn can influence the assessment that family members make of their family life. This study establishes a systemic viewpoint in which the family satisfaction of dual-earner parents and their adolescent children is affected by the parents’ work-to-family conflict, and by the adolescents’ perception of their parents’ work interference with the parent-child relationship. A sample of 473 families composed of different-sex dual-earner parents and one adolescent child were recruited in Temuco, Chile. The parents responded to a measure of work-to-family conflict; the adolescents responded to a measure of perception of each parent’s work interference in the parent-child relationship; the three family members responded to the Satisfaction with Family Scale. Analyses were conducted using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model and structural equation modelling. Results showed that parents’ work-to-family conflict negatively affected their own family satisfaction, but not that of their adolescent child. However, parents’ work-to-family conflict was positively linked to the adolescent’s perception of the parents’ work interference in the parent-child relationship. This latter variable, in turn, had a mediating role between parents’ work-to-family conflict and the adolescent’s family satisfaction. Other effects of this perception of interference varied by the parent’s gender. These findings expand the knowledge on the relationship between work and family domains, showing that adolescents are actively involved in their parents’ experiences of the work-family interface."

Method: The sample was composed of 269 dual-earner parents with one child between 10 and 17 years of age in Temuco, Chile. Results: A cluster analysis was used to distinguish three family profiles: “mothers moderately satisfied with their food-related life, and fathers and adolescents satisfied” (Group 1, 32.7%), “families extremely satisfied with their food-related life” (Group 2, 55.0%) and “mothers and fathers satisfied with their food-related life, and adolescents moderately satisfied” (Group 3, 12.3%). Groups differed in the way that the three family members’ perceived family functioning, both parents’ work-life balance and perception of the financial situation of the household, as well as in the mother’s depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Conclusions: The results of this study can guide research on the links between food-related life and other life domains, and it may provide guidelines for campaigns and interventions to promote healthy eating habits and practices in different age groups."

The questionnaire included the following scales: Family Resources scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Satisfaction with Food-related Life and Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS). Using factor analysis, two dimensions were detected on the Family Resources scale: intangible resources (Cronbach’s α = 0.886) and tangible resources (Cronbach’s α = 0.824). A cluster analysis applied to the Z-scores from the factor analysis classified three typologies: students with high support in tangible resources, satisfied with their life and their food-related life (18.2 %), students with low support from their families, moderately satisfied with their life and their food-related life (20.7 %), and students with support in intangible and tangible resources, satisfied with their life and their food-related life (61.1 %), who scored significantly higher on the SHS. The typologies differed in the place of residence during the period of studies, socioeconomic level, need to work while studying, frequency and time available for having lunch in the place of residence, and body mass index. The family support students receive as tangible or economic resources is positively related to life satisfaction and to the domain of food, whereas family support in intangible or social resources is related to happiness."
306,2,"TITLE: Materialism in Pedagogy Students in Chile | KEYWORDS: Material values; Material values scale; Materialism; Pedagogy students; Psychometric properties | ABSTRACT: Many studies have used Richins and Dawson's (J Consum Res 19: 303-316, 1992) Material Values Scale (MVS), applying it to different types of populations that exhibit a particular psychometric behavior, and showing little stability in their factorial structure. In the present study, 1,070 pedagogy students from the northern, central and southern regions of Chile answered the MVS. This sample was randomly divided in two. Using the first sub-sample (N = 539), an exploratory factorial analysis was carried out, from which a structure of nine items was grouped into two factors called ""Social Success"" and ""Personal Happiness"", which presented adequate reliability. Later, with the second sub-sample (N = 531), the factorial structure indicated above was put to the test through a confirmatory factorial analysis. The data from the model show that the scale contains 8 items in total, grouped into two dimensions. The factorial loads are significant at the level of 1 %, which indicates that the 2-factor structure can be confirmed. Finally-using the proposed structure-the presence of the students' material values was evaluated. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

313,0,"TITLE: Dissenting from what? the rupture of Chilean teachers with the long-term consensus on teacher professional development | KEYWORDS: Chile; dissent; performance-based accountability; Teachers’ movement; teachers’ policy | ABSTRACT: This article examines the division within Chile’s main teacher organisation caused by a dissident movement during the development of the new National Teaching Policy (PND), which occurred between the years 2014 and 2016. It focuses on the teachers’ collective awakening and the internal logic of neoliberal teacher policies. Through interviews and policy analysis, the study concludes that the dissident teacher movement has made visible the exclusion of teachers’ experiences in PND discussions, undermining the so-called consensus on teacher professional development. However, while we argue that these findings illustrate the importance of teachers’ unions as policy actors, we also suggest that this latter role is limited if they do not develop, in addition to the necessary critique, a shared political-pedagogical project."

Theoretically, the conceptual metaphor of bonsai pedagogy is proposed to understand teachers’ processes of subjectivation enacted by neoliberal discourses, policies, and practices. The article aims to understand the relationship between the processes of (de/re)-professionalisation and the subjective experience of malaise, suffering, and sickness lived by teachers in the exercise of their work. Bonsai pedagogy is offered as a complementary category of analysis and interpretation of these processes that is more sensitive to teachers’ subjectivity. The research is based on 35 narrative interviews with Chilean dissident schoolteachers who are members of teachers’ political organisations. I analyse three strategies used by the bonsai pedagogy: i) controlling and saturating teachers’ time; ii) managing and guiding teachers’ practices; and iii) obstructing teachers’ creativity. I discuss how the bonsai pedagogy reduces the capacity of teachers to unfold and construct their subjectivity in alternative ways. Since Chile has implemented neoliberal reforms in education longer than any other country, understanding how neoliberalism operates through and around Chilean teachers can contribute to furthering our knowledge of how teachers worldwide can resist and deal with neoliberalism."

Whilst this scholarship has generated new knowledge about what happens to people, contexts and educational systems when they are regulated by neoliberal logics, it has also subsumed the sociological imagination under what this episteme considers valuable. The paper aims to challenge this excessive focus on the neoliberal episteme by broadening our research scope to recover the subjects’ magmatic expression in SOE research. To do this, we introduce Hugo Zemelman’s notion of subject to examine how SOE can overcome this neoliberal closure. The paper discusses three epistemic movements: focusing on the subject, researching the undetermined possibilities of the present in a given order, and, paying attention to the evocative and symbolic aspects of thinking and language."
316,0,"TITLE: An autonomous teacher subject as a force of pedagogical renewal: two historical moments of activation of the teacher's movement in Chile | KEYWORDS: Autonomous Subject; Chile; Pedagogical Renewal; Social Movements; Subjectivity; Teachers | ABSTRACT: Based on Hugo Zemelman's notion of the autonomous subject as the ability to react to circumstances, this article offers a theoretical reading of two historical moments of the Chilean teachers' movement where processes of pedagogical renewal are unfolded through the activation of a teacher subject. The first moment takes place in the first half of the 20th century with the emergence of pedagogical experimentation and its ability to renew pedagogical «normalism» The second takes place at the end of the 20th century with the emergence of a Pedagogical Movement and its ability to renew a teaching policy configured by the economic parameters of neoliberal precariousness. Methodologically, I turn to secondary sources to analyse both historical moments. Rather than obeying a historiographic work, the analysis consists of a theoretical reading of both historical moments, and it illustrates that an autonomous teacher subject, capable of thinking critically about its circumstances, is key to unfolding processes of pedagogical renewal. By way of conclusion, I argue that both teachers' movements share a process of activation and pedagogical renewal of the educational thinking of teachers. I also briefly refer to the political, theoretical, and practical challenge emerging from the analysis: how to keep autonomy flowing."

We reflect on specific experiences during ethnographic fieldwork. First, the entrance or access to schools is addressed, which requires a negotiation process where the context, actors and ways of interacting conditions the future of the ethnographic research. Second, we reflect on positions attributed to the researcher by actors of the educational community once inside the school. These circumstances influence the viewpoint of the ethnographer and his or her relationship to school culture and its agents. Given the lack of similar work in Chile, this article is expected to contribute to the development of greater reflexivity in ethnographic work."

We conducted our work through an ethnographic approach, using material produced in two ethnographies of municipal schools. We used the analysis of the metaphor ""the school as a sick body"" in order to articulate the analysis of the policy as texts and as a discourse. The main findings were: i) students are simultaneously desired since they entail additional resources and rejected since they are responsible for enrollment reduction and increased teaching hardship; ii) school communities recognize the need to receive external help, but they criticize the intervention. Finally, we conclude that discourses about school efficacy improvement and accountability are subordinate to the discourse on education as a market good."

An ethnographic study in two schools classified as in recovery Transformaciones en la cultura escolar en el marco de la implementación de políticas de accountability en Chile. Un estudio etnográfico en dos escuelas clasificadas en recuperación | KEYWORDS: Accountability policies; Priority school voucher law; School ethnography; School improvement policies | ABSTRACT: Priority School Voucher Law (SEP) is part of the goal of educational policy in Chile to improve the quality and equity of learning by giving more resources to those schools that receive students from the poorest third of the country. The inclusion of schools in the SEP regime involves mechanisms destined to generate changes in them, especially in those that have been classified as emerging or recovering. What changes in school culture is generating the implementation of the SEP? To answer this question we are conducting a three year ethnographic study (2012-2014) in two schools classified, in 2012, as in recovery. We present the results of the first year of study, which revealed two major findings: schools perceived as endangered, and a lack of dialogue in the Councils of Teachers, a discussion of its implications for improving the situation is presented."
320,9,"TITLE: Integrating mental health and psychosocial support into economic inclusion programming for displaced families in Ecuador | KEYWORDS: Economic inclusion; Forcibly displaced persons; Mental health and psychosocial support; Poverty alleviation | ABSTRACT: Background: Poverty is a key social determinant of mental health among forcibly displaced persons. This study aimed to design and pilot test a strategy to integrate existing mental health and economic inclusion interventions for displaced families in Ecuador. Methods: We conducted a series of qualitative interviews (n = 30), focus groups (n = 6), and workshops (n = 3) to develop a set of strategies for integrating cross-cutting and focused mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) strategies into an existing economic inclusion program for displaced families in Quito. We non-randomly assigned two field offices in Quito to (1) integrate cross-cutting strategies focused on improving economic outcomes or (2) integrate both those cross-cutting strategies plus focused MHPSS strategies into an economic inclusion program. We measured site-level implementation outcomes (adoption, appropriateness, acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, reach, retention, usability) and participant-level psychosocial (wellbeing, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, functioning) and economic inclusion outcomes (financial resources, diet diversity, social capital/networks, self-reliance) over six months. We conducted a mixed-methods analysis to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the integration strategies and the ability to evaluate their effects in a future cluster randomized trial. Results: We developed a toolkit that included 10 strategies for integrating MHPSS into economic inclusion interventions. Fifty displaced persons participating in an existing economic inclusion program (25 per study condition) were enrolled and 88% remained in the study through the six-month follow-up. Participants and implementers reported that the integration strategy was appropriate, acceptable, feasible, and usable. Implementers, including people without prior experience in delivering mental health services, were able to deliver the intervention with high fidelity. Integration of focused MHPSS intervention components into an economic inclusion program appeared to improve MHPSS outcomes, the strength of social capital and networks, and engagement in economic and other programs. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of the acceptability and feasibility of integrating MHPSS into economic inclusion programs for displaced people. We found evidence supporting evaluation methods that can be employed in a future study to definitively test the added value of integrated approaches to mental health and economic wellbeing for displaced persons."
321,2,"TITLE: Cross-cultural adaptation of four instruments to measure stigma towards people with mental illness and substance use problems among primary care professionals in Chile | KEYWORDS: Cross-cultural adaptation; instruments; mental illness; stigma; substance use problems | ABSTRACT: Stigma toward people with mental illness and substance use problems is a significant global concern, and prevents people with these conditions from accessing treatment, particularly in primary health care (PHC) settings. Stigma is a cultural phenomenon that is influenced by particular contexts and can differ by country and region. The majority of stigma research focuses on Europe or North America leading to a lack of culturally relevant stigma research instruments for the Latin American context. The present study describes and discusses the methodology for cross-culturally adapting four stigma measurement scales to the Chilean context. The cross-cultural adaptation process included nine phases: (1) preparation; (2) independent translations; (3) synthesis 1 with expert committee; (4) focus groups and interviews with researchers, PHC professionals, and PHC users; (5) synthesis 2 with expert committee; (6) independent back translations; (7) synthesis 3 with expert committee; (8) pilot with PHC professionals; and (9) final revisions. The adaptation process included an array of diverse voices from the PHC context, and met three adaptation objectives defined prior to beginning the process (Understandability, Relevance, and Acceptability and Answer Options). The resulting, culturally adapted questionnaire is being validated and implemented within PHC settings across Chile to provide in-depth insight into stigma among PHC professionals in the country. The authors hope it will be useful for future research on mental illness and substance use stigma in similar settings across Latin America."
322,2,"TITLE: Including culture in programs to reduce stigma toward people with mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries | KEYWORDS: interventions; low- and middle-income countries; mental illness; stigma | ABSTRACT: Stigma is one of the main barriers for the full implementation of mental health services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Recently, many initiatives to reduce stigma have been launched in these settings. Nevertheless, the extent to which these interventions are effective and culturally sensitive remains largely unknown. The present review addresses these two issues by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of interventions to reduce stigma toward mental illness that have been implemented in LMICs. We conducted a scoping review of scientific papers in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCO, OVID, Embase, and SciELO. Keywords in English, Spanish, and Portuguese were included. Articles published from January 1990 to December 2017 were incorporated into this article. Overall, the studies were of low-to-medium methodological quality—most only included evaluations after intervention or short follow-up periods (1–3 months). The majority of programs focused on improving knowledge and attitudes through the education of healthcare professionals, community members, or consumers. Only 20% (5/25) of the interventions considered cultural values, meanings, and practices. This gap is discussed in the light of evidence from cultural studies conducted in both low and high income countries. Considering the methodological shortcomings and the absence of cultural adaptation, future efforts should consider better research designs, with longer follow-up periods, and more suitable strategies to incorporate relevant cultural features of each community."
323,0,"TITLE: Do Cultural Values Affect Quality of Life Evaluation? | KEYWORDS: Crosscultural; Cultural values; Quality of life; Spanish speaker | ABSTRACT: Schwartz defines cultural values as motivational types, where each value reflects goals and objectives to be achieved. According to Schwartz, cultural values are related to an orientation that is individualistic (values referred to as power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation and self-direction), collectivistic (benevolence, tradition and conformity) or mixed (security and universalism). Today, there is a theoretical consensus that cultural values are mediators in the evaluation of quality of life (QOL); nonetheless, there are few published studies to date relating them to QOL. To determine whether a significant relationship exits between cultural values and QOL in three Spanish-speaking countries. A total of 821 persons participated: 321 from Chile, 200 from Spain and 300 from Cuba. The Schwartz Cultural Values Survey and the WHOQOL-BREF Quality of Life Scale were used. Analysis of variance, and correlation and regression analyses were preformed after collecting data. Only hedonism was significantly correlated with the global evaluation of QOL in Spain and Chile. Few correlations were found in all three countries between cultural values and the QOL domains evaluated, with the exceptions of the value of self-direction, which was related to physical well-being, and the value stimulation, which was correlated with psychological as well as social well-being in all three countries. Certain values may be associated with a better perception of QOL, depending on the particular culture of the population evaluated. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
324,14,"TITLE: Critical minerals versus major minerals: a comparative study of exploration budgets | KEYWORDS: Critical metals; Geological scarcity; Mineral exploration; Non-renewable resources; Q30; Q38 | ABSTRACT: Disruptions in the minerals supply chain play a central role in defining the future stock of minerals; therefore, an in-depth analysis of the outcomes and variables affecting exploration is required. In comparative terms, the exploration of critical minerals and major minerals presents geological and technical differences; thus, exploration budgets for critical minerals should be expected to depart from those observed in other minerals. In this context, the main goal of this paper is to contrast how exploration budgets differ between critical and major minerals when considering a set of key variables. We take a multivariate statistical analysis approach based on firm-level budget exploration data to show four key findings: exploration budgets allocated for critical minerals remain consistently lower than major minerals even when controlling for other factors. Moreover, they present a higher sensitivity to fluctuations in commodity prices. Besides, the investment made by larger companies in critical minerals significantly lags behind those made by junior companies. Additionally, the focus of exploration activity for critical minerals predominantly lies in the earlier stages of the exploration process. We expect these initial results to be used as a step forward to facilitate the discussion about exploration policies and, consequently, the reliability of the supply chain."
325,-1,"TITLE: Job training in polarizing job markets: A longitudinal analysis using administrative microdata | KEYWORDS: job polarization; job training; knowledge-to-digital-economy transition; technological change | ABSTRACT: Developed nations have experienced a longstanding trend of reshaping the labour market's occupational structure. This trend, named job market polarization, describes how middle-level jobs have decreased their relative share of the labour market in favour of high- and low-complexity jobs. The literature has pointed to technological change as the main factor in setting this configuration, which accompanied the transition to a knowledge economy as a source of competitive advantages. Still, the narratives of technological change are anchored to specific technologies and times that do not fit the emerging challenges of the fourth industrial revolution and the increasing relevance of the digital economy. In this paper, I explore how job polarization dynamics have interacted with active labour market policies' effectiveness by focusing on job training skill premiums. I use nationally representative data to evaluate cross-sectionally and longitudinally the relationship between job training access, job polarization, and wages. The results show that polarization poses a wage penalty while it increases the relative value of training skill premium. I discuss how the setting of a polarized market could be considered for future skill-based interventions concerning digital technologies."

By applying a systematic review under PRISMA guidelines, it identifies thematic trends and institutional challenges shaping the regional epistemic community. The findings highlight systemic gaps, including limited journal specialization and underrepresentation of regional voices within the global PA discourse. The study emphasizes theoretical and methodological contributions addressing civil service reforms, PA education, and institutional development while critiquing the pervasive influence of epistemic colonialism. By proposing strategies to integrate local and global perspectives, this work advances the decolonization of PA, fostering inclusive and contextually relevant paradigms. These insights aim to enhance Latin American contributions to global PA debates, bridging disciplinary divides and addressing regional priorities."
327,-1,"TITLE: Turning fragments into a lens: Technological change, industrial revolutions, and labor | KEYWORDS: Industrial revolutions; Job market polarization; Technological change; Technological unemployment | ABSTRACT: During the last fifty years, the world has experienced the full effects of the third industrial revolution (workplace computerization and ICTs) and the beginnings of the fourth industrial revolution (automation and digitalization of the production process). As massive transformations for societies and national economies, those technological disruptions have brought several changes for companies' and individuals' interactions in the labor market. The relationship between technology and work has been primarily studied from economics, sociology, and managerial perspectives. However, the dispersion of the narratives of technological change and the disciplinary perspectives provides a complex standpoint for analyzing the phenomenon between both moments of technological disruption. This paper presents a history of how the labor market has evolved in the context of technological change."
328,-1,"TITLE: Wage heterogeneity in the graduate market: Industry and public-private differences in Chile | KEYWORDS: Graduate market; higher education expansion; public employment; workforce policy | ABSTRACT: Lifelong education has proven to be a significant challenge in the policy arena. The combination of formal education and labor-centered institutions has pressed the development of different mechanisms to understand the role of human capital accumulation in socioeconomic mobility and organizational performance. While the narratives of lifelong education have primed labor and educational studies across developed economies, in the case of developing economies, those logics appear contested by development economics conditions. In this paper, I use the context of the expansion of the graduate educational market and its policy reforms to analyze how a developing economy copes with a change in the availability of a highly educated workforce. Using panel and pseudo-panel data, I examine the evolution of educational returns for the graduate workforce in Chile between 1990 and 2018, considering the differences between industries and public and private sectors. The results point out that there are no public-private differences and high heterogeneity across economic sectors. The policy- and individual-level consequences are discussed."
329,-1,"TITLE: Educational mismatch, labor market completeness, and gender: Evidence from Chile | KEYWORDS: Educational mismatch; Human capital; Incomplete markets; Labor discrimination | ABSTRACT: This paper examines educational mismatch in Chile, a stable developing economy in Latin America, through the lens of incomplete markets. I offer three significant contributions to the field. Firstly, I develop a theoretical framework rooted in the job competition model and incomplete markets theory, placing educational mismatch in a historical context. This perspective broadens the discourse beyond conventional economic and sociological viewpoints, considering factors like the timing of higher education. Secondly, I explore the connection between educational mismatch's impact on wages and labor market discrimination, particularly gender-based disparities. This sheds light on how female workers are affected by educational mismatch. Lastly, I address methodological concerns by utilizing longitudinal data to refine our analysis, responding to critiques about using cross-sectional data to estimate educational mismatch. This study enhances the understanding of educational mismatch, offering insights specific to Chile's developing economy and contributing to a more comprehensive view of this issue in emerging economies."

These data are used to test for different patterns of use for policy vs management knowledge. Findings suggest that journal quality positively affects policy use but negatively affects management use and that topics suggested by practitioners affect management use but not policy use. The researchers’ degree of motivation to have their work used is important in both types of knowledge use. Overall, the results suggest there may be greater spillovers to practical use derived from standard academic publishing pursuits than generally believed."
331,-1,"TITLE: Assessing job training effectiveness in Chile: A longitudinal approach | KEYWORDS: human capital; knowledge-to-digital-economy transition; policy evaluation; training system | ABSTRACT: The process of technological change brings significant challenges to societies. While private sector organizations seek to include new technologies in their production processes, individuals and government agencies look for possibilities for adaptation. In the context of highly unequal countries such as those in Latin America, the way the adaptation occurs can play a significant role in social mobility and family wealth creation. As the literature suggests, one of the essential policy tools to cope with changes in the labor market lies in job training policies. In this article, I assess the effectiveness of the Chilean training system, focusing on how training affects wages. Using the Casen household survey and the Social Protection Survey longitudinal versions, I estimate a training skill premium near 11%. While the different data sources show that job training has an effect, differentiation of this effect lies with the decision maker in the training process."
332,0,"TITLE: Are we ready? Labour market transit to the digital economy | KEYWORDS: credential inflations; Educational mismatch; fourth industrial revolution; job polarisation | ABSTRACT: Industrialised countries are currently facing the knowledge-to-digital economy transition. That transition is strictly defined by how the labour market is organised and operates in the national economy. Some old to new phenomena are determinants of those dimensions, such as educational mismatch, credential inflation, and job polarisation. These phenomena affect the relationship between schooling and earnings, carrying consequences for social mobility, household welfare, and an individual's social progression perspective. Those phenomena remain understudied in the context of Latin America. Chile's case has gained relevance in the region due to the highly deregulated organisation of its educational market, the quality increase in its higher education institutions, and its funding policies for higher education. This work attempts to provide an extended diagnosis of the Chilean labour market, considering the impact of these emerging issues on the educational market and policymaking. The results show that 83.6% of Chilean employees experience an educational mismatch (overeducation and undereducation); credential inflation has depreciated the value of education over five of the six occupational categories – besides the polarisation index for industrialised countries such as the United Kingdom."
333,1,"TITLE: Does the expansion of higher education reduce gender gaps in the labor market? Evidence from a natural experiment | KEYWORDS: Gender wage gap; Glass ceiling; Higher education expansion | ABSTRACT: In 2005 Chilean congress approved a bill that established a new funding tool for higher education funding through a “private system” of student loans (named CAE). The system aimed to support higher education inclusion among students with academic merits overcoming the lack of resources for ensuring access. Politicians have referred to this reform in higher education funding as a critical factor for expanding higher education enrollment. By its immediate results, it is a great strategy to cope with inequality and social mobility issues. However, there is little empirical evidence about labor market variables' overall effects, such as gender discrimination. This work attempts to estimate the new instrument's impact on the three standard measures of gender labor discrimination: labor participation, the gender wage gap, and the glass ceiling. The empirical strategy uses a difference-in-difference approach to provide estimates. The results indicate that the CAE policy changed women's labor market participation and contributed to close the gender pay gap in the labor market. However, the glass ceiling increased in the entire labor market, but not in the white-collar job market in specific."
334,1,"TITLE: Does credentialism affect the gender wage gap? Evidence from Chile | KEYWORDS: educational credentialism; gender wage gap; human capital | ABSTRACT: The expansion of higher education across the globe changed the dynamics of social inclusion and exclusion during the last century. As a result of the increase in higher-education enrollment, societies have reduced social gaps in education and labor. Moreover, higher-education expansion policies have led to a diversification in the quality of higher-education institutions and workforce configurations, which has allowed for the increased participation of women in the education and labor market. Evidence on higher-education expansion has shown only a minor decrease in gender gaps in the labor market. One explanation is the presence of credential market configuration, where degrees signal social status. This research focuses on how educational credentialism affects the gender wage gap, using the CASEN Household Survey of Chile. It aims to assess the effects of a credential on earnings, using a regression framework and data set between 2013 and 2017. The results point to a differential effect of credentials across genders, interpreted as a systematic bias toward human capital pricings, with particular effects on the gender wage gap."
335,0,"TITLE: About the (non) existence of a lifelong education system in Chile | KEYWORDS: active market policies; human capital; lifelong education; Public policy | ABSTRACT: This article aims to present the lifelong education system of Chile from a functional and institutional point of view, in an attempt to describe its strategy. This paper covers both formal education and graduate studies, which were analyzed systematically from the institutional framework and experience of Chile. A comprehensive review of open access data of Chilean higher education was performed, analyzing human capital investment and access to post-secondary education. The main findings are based on the lack of coordination between the educational levels and postsecondary education which make career progression and integration difficult, obstructing tenure and qualifications valuation by employers. In an ageing society such as that of Chile, workers may be forced to take up continuously training courses to sustain their situation inside the labour market. If there is no coordination between training and educational system, workers will face major difficulties in being considered as employable. This work opens the question of lifelong education policies in less developed countries such as Chile, which is facing the same demographic phenomenon as developed countries, but without the same level of resources or institutional development. This article concludes with the requirements for the design of this kind of educational policy."

We propose the construct of contextualism, referring to beliefs about the importance of context in understanding people, as a facet of cultural collectivism. A brief measure was developed and refined across 19 nations (Study 1: N = 5,241), showing good psychometric properties for cross-cultural use and correlating well at the nation level with other supposed facets and indicators of I-C. In Study 2 (N = 8,652), nation-level contextualism predicted ingroup favoritism, corruption, and differential trust of ingroup and outgroup members, while controlling for other facets of I-C, across 35 nations. We conclude that contextualism is an important part of cultural collectivism. This highlights the importance of beliefs alongside values and self-representations and contributes to a wider understanding of cultural processes. © The Author(s) 2013."
338,1,"TITLE: Perceived Fairness of Couples’ Division of Housework: Evidence From a Multi-Factorial Experiment in the United States | KEYWORDS: fairness; gender inequality; household labor; survey experiments | ABSTRACT: Although the ratio of women’s to men’s housework hours has declined, women still spend more time than men doing household tasks in most high-income contexts. This article examines one of the hypothesized mechanisms underlying the persistence of housework disparities—fairness perceptions—via a survey experiment in the United States. We ask: What factors contribute to fairness assessments of unequal divisions of housework in different-sex couples? Given increasing trends in gender-egalitarian attitudes, do people still think it is more fair for women to do a larger share of the housework? To address these questions, we relied on a multi-factorial vignette experiment on a nationally representative sample of 1,502 adults, in which respondents rated the fairness of the divisions of housework among hypothetical couples. Our results demonstrate that respondents engage in trade-off calculations that, to some extent, justify unequal divisions of housework. Spouses’ relative earnings and work time were assessed as contributions that justify doing fewer housework chores for both men and women. Contrary to our expectations, we find that people perceive arrangements where women perform a higher proportion of housework as less fair than scenarios where men do so. These results suggest a shift in public opinion regarding prescriptive gendered norms about housework divisions, contrasting with the decreasing but persistent gender gap in housework disadvantaging women."
339,1,"TITLE: No End to Hypergamy when Considering the Full Married Population | KEYWORDS: assortative mating; education; homogamy; hypergamy; Latin America; marriage | ABSTRACT: The worldwide expansion of female educational opportunities in recent decades has prompted demographers to assess the frequency with which women marry up (hypergamy) or down (hypogamy) with regard to education. A series of articles documented dramatic and nearly universal declines in hypergamy over time and across female educational advantage. However, this previous work investigated hypergamy only in the context of unequal educational pairings, excluding couples with equal levels of education (homogamy) from their analyses. Here, we argue that the prevalence of hypergamy should instead be assessed in relation to all marriages. We apply this approach to the case of Latin America, where women have made important gains in schooling relative to men. Using census microdata spanning 105 birth cohorts in 16 countries, we demonstrate that, rather than declining, hypergamy has increased in most countries over time and remains relatively stable across female educational advantage. Meanwhile, the prevalence of educational homogamy has declined considerably in most countries and across the axis of female educational advantage, an important trend that emerges only when homogamy is incorporated into the analysis."
340,9,"TITLE: Marrying across Borders in Latin America: Visualizing Intermarriage Flows | KEYWORDS: intermarriage; Latin America; migration | ABSTRACT: The authors propose an adaptation of the well-known “circular plot,” traditionally used to quantify international migration flows, to visualize patterns of intermarriage within Latin American countries. The authors present data on intermarriage flows between partners’ countries of origin using data from recent household surveys from five Latin American countries. The visualization allows an easy-to-grasp snapshot of marital pairings considering partners born in different countries, as well as the identification of their spatial patterns. In some countries, such as Colombia and Peru, most intermarriage occurs between natives and Venezuelans. Conversely, in Chile, Ecuador, and Uruguay, there is much wider heterogeneity in country-pair combinations. In Chile, no country-pair combination dominates, reflecting the more balanced nature of migration flows from a broader set of countries. Overall, the results aid the interpretation of trends and patterns in marriage across country lines by placing them within a comparative regional context. This is a flexible tool that could be easily adapted to multiple other countries within or outside of the region, to analyses over time, and to a heterogeneous array of couple-level characteristics."
341,1,"TITLE: Mass Education and Women’s Autonomy: Evidence From Latin America | KEYWORDS: Compulsory schooling; Gender; Instrumental variables; LatinAmerica; Women’s autonomy | ABSTRACT: Most low-and middle-income countries have implemented mass education reforms in the last few decades. Demographers and policymakers have posited that mass schooling would enhance women’s autonomy and, therefore, accelerate population transformations in the Global South. However, gains in women’s schooling may have unexpected implications for female autonomy in contexts where hypergamy norms—the ideal that men should marry down and women should marry up in education and other markers of status—are still dominant. This study addresses difficulties in evaluating the causal impact of additional education on women’s autonomy by leveraging the timing of compulsory schooling reforms in three Latin American countries: Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. Using Demographic and Health Surveys, I implement an instrumental variable design using random exposure to compulsory schooling laws as an instrument for years of education. Results show that for women who entered the school system as a result of compulsory reforms, further schooling decreased their level of autonomy in all countries—especially among women from rural Bolivia and Peru. Additional analyses suggest these results are explained by changes in the selection into schooling and the formation of unions defying hypergamy norms. Together, these findings highlight the importance of examining the returns to mass schooling considering population heterogeneity and the contextual meaning of women’s education."

However, the conventional approach to model selection and specification suffers from at least two limitations: reliance on oftentimes equivocal diagnostics yielded by fit statistics, and the inability to identify patterns of association not covered by model candidates. In this article, we propose an application of Lasso regularization that addresses the aforementioned limitations. We evaluate our method through a Monte Carlo experiment and an empirical study of educational assortative mating in Chile, 1990–2015. Results demonstrate that our approach has the virtue, relative to ad hoc specification searches, of offering a principled statistical criterion to inductively select a model. Importantly, we show that in situations where conventional fit statistics provide conflicting diagnostics, our Lasso-based approach is consistent in its model choice, yielding solutions that are both predictive and parsimonious."
343,19,"TITLE: In the Hands of Women: Conditional Cash Transfers and Household Dynamics | KEYWORDS: decision-making; family policies; gender; housework; international; quantitative methodology | ABSTRACT: Objective: This study examines the effect of welfare payments provided to women on intra-household decision-making, female autonomy, and perceptions of responsibility for housework, by exploiting the case of Mexico's Progresa conditional cash transfer program. Background: Although past scholarship has extensively studied the relationship between wives' labor market earnings and household dynamics, fewer studies have analyzed the causal impact of women's welfare payments on these outcomes. These resources have become increasingly important as policy initiatives, especially in developing countries, have focused on implementing targeted programs promoting women's economic empowerment. Method: A sample of married and cohabiting couples participating in Progresa was constructed using the National Survey of Household Characteristics (N = 9,751 unions). Random assignment to the program allowed to estimate the causal effects of Progresa payments after 1.5 years, controlling for unobserved factors. Results: Progresa cash transfers had a positive effect on attitudinal measures of housework and female autonomy, while they did not change household decision-making. Progresa payments did not generate a gender backlash response among treated families—such as pushing women further into unpaid labor, as some critics expected. Conclusion: In the short-run, Progresa cash transfers improved women's position in the household. These findings are consistent with both resource-based and time constraints perspectives. Implications: This study illustrates how can we exploit field experiments to answer sociological questions concerning the family."
344,1,"TITLE: Fearing Such a Lady: University Expansion, Underemployment, and the Hypergamy Ideal in Kampala, Uganda | KEYWORDS: Africa; culture; gender; marriage; romantic relationships | ABSTRACT: In Uganda, the cultural norm of hypergamy, which dictates that husbands should have higher economic and social status than wives, is pervasive and influential. Yet hypergamy has recently been challenged by women’s gains in education relative to men and by an unemployment crisis leaving educated young men unable to find steady work. Using interviews with recent university graduates in Kampala, we investigate how highly educated young adults navigate frictions between the hypergamy ideal and these recent transformations in gendered status. Some women reduce the salience of hypergamy by preventing their relationships from becoming serious, while other women intentionally perform the role of submissive housewife while preserving their autonomy. Men reframe their romantic circumstances to underplay their inability to achieve economic hypergamy, portraying educated women as undesirable and characterizing their partners as nonmaterialistic. These findings reveal how demographic and economic changes reconfigure relationship norms, gendered power dynamics, and family formation processes."

This paper examines this question in Mexico, which enacted two important school expansion plans between 1959 and 1992. Using the 2011 Mexican Social Mobility Survey, I analyze how intergenerational mobility changes under different phases of expansion reform, and how do these trends vary according to the particular stage of the schooling process. Main findings indicate that mobility patterns are not stalled across cohorts, as reproduction theories predict. However, they do not reflect equalization at all levels of education either, as modernization hypotheses anticipate. Expansion reforms, especially the “11-year plan,” are associated with positive trends in mobility in primary and lower-secondary schooling, but also with a decrease in intergenerational mobility at higher levels of education. Thus, these findings are consistent with the maximally maintained inequality hypothesis."
346,0,"TITLE: Short-run effects of accountability pressures on teacher policies and practices in the voucher system in Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; School accountability; teacher policy; vouchers | ABSTRACT: This research analyzes the impact of the Adjusted Voucher Law´s school rankings on low-performing schools in Santiago, Chile, and provides evidence on the effects of the pressures of accountability systems on teacher policies and practices. The empirical strategy is based on the fact that schools are ranked according to their position on a set of thresholds. We used a generalization of the traditional regression discontinuity design for the case where treatment assignment is determined by n variables. To gather information on teacher policies and practices, we conducted a survey of 4th-grade teachers in the Greater Santiago area. The results indicate that low-performing schools responded to the treatment by implementing policies that seek to improve their results in the short term. We also found no significant effects on teaching practices, suggesting that many of these changes are implemented top down from the school administrators, without involving teachers in the process."

Critics counter that choice may exacerbate inequities as advantaged parents are more likely to choose the best schools. Rio de Janeiro and Santiago provide unique institutional contexts in which to explore how choice may affect equity. We use datasets with information on home addresses to compare the choices of parents with different backgrounds. We find that disadvantaged parents in both cities are less likely to choose high achieving schools. The differences are more pronounced in Santiago than in Rio. These results suggest that choice policies will likely not reduce inequities and the design of the program influences behavior."

Climate sensitive planning and design draws attention to the consideration of climate parameters for decision making. Seeking to contribute to the above, this research set out to identify the effect of urban design features (e.g., vegetation cover and construction density) on air temperature behavior. We conducted a case study, selected the Renca municipality located north-west Santiago, Chile, which represents a Mediterranean urban area affected by an intense daytime and nighttime urban heat island (UHI). We developed simple linear regression models to estimate air temperature per block in four different present and future scenarios: summer and winter and for day (16:00) and night (23:00). The urban-environmental variables were evaluated with the air temperature data series, measured in 21 points in the commune which were representative of urban and natural local climatic zones (LCZ). The results were evaluated and validated. We observed that variables such as vegetation, surface temperature or relative humidity are important explanatory factors for air temperature at the block scale in Renca across all four models. Models represent a tool that allows the evaluation of different design and urban planning alternatives at the scale of a city block, providing useful information for climate-sensitive decision-making."
351,6,"TITLE: Perception of thermal comfort in outdoor public spaces in the medium-sized city of Chillán, Chile, during a warm summer | KEYWORDS: Environmental comfort; Perceived thermal comfort; Public space; Socioeconomic status | ABSTRACT: The study of thermal comfort in Latin American cities has been gaining great relevance for urban environmental planning. Some studies have evaluated the relationship between environmental and perceived comfort; however, the causes and social determinants of the different perceptions of the population have not been explored. The perception of thermal comfort in public spaces in the city of Chillán (Chile), which has an inland Mediterranean climate, is discussed in this context. First, we measured the environmental thermal comfort, adapting the Actual Sensation Vote index. A survey of 362 users of the five selected public spaces was carried out between 29 January and 01 February 2016 to obtain perceived comfort and relate it to the individual climatic history, use of public space and place of residence in the city. The results show that perceived thermal discomfort dominates over comfort on summer days; however, those users who visit public spaces for recreational purposes feel more comfortable, as well as those living in low socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods. On the other hand, users living in areas with higher socioeconomic status, have higher expectations regarding thermal environmental conditions."

In both, the horror is based on the relation between mother and sons, whose tension can be understood from the concept of the abject (Kristeva, 1980). In The Babadook, the horror materializes in the maternal body that is represented as an abject: she appears bathed in blood, puking and chasing her son in order to annihilate him. Also, it develops the traditional metaphorical link between the house and the maternal body (Hormigos, 2010) with the purpose of representing her threatening aspect: the space is imaginated as a confinement that may engulf the body of the self. The film shows the danger of sinking into the mother's body, joy that is forbidden by the also frightening -and also abject- presence of the Father. On the other hand, in Ich seh, ich seh we see the violence that involves the separation of Elias from the law of the mother through the failed elaboration of a sinthome. Also here the signifiers of the abject threaten to annihilate the subjects, and they are represented as elements that contrast with the cleanliness of the domestic space, which is protected from the invasion of the animal and the wild, in order to guard the proper body from. Este artículo busca analizar la representación de la madre como figura terrorífica en dos filmes de terror actuales: The Babadook (2014) e Ich seh, ich seh (2014). En ambas, el horror se fundamenta en el vínculo entre madres e hijos, cuya tensión puede entenderse a partir del concepto de lo abyecto (Kristeva, 1980). En The Babadook, el horror se materializa en el cuerpo de la madre que es representado como un abyecto: aparece bañada en sangre, vomitando y persiguiendo a su hijo para aniquilarlo. Se desarrolla además el tradicional vínculo metafórico entre la casa y el cuerpo materno (Hormigos 2010) a fin de expresar su aspecto amenazante: el espacio se piensa como encierro que amenaza con engullir al cuerpo del yo. El filme expone el peligro de hundirse al interior del cuerpo materno, goce que es impedido por la también aterradora -y también abyecta- presencia del Padre. Por otra parte, en Ich seh, ich seh, presenciamos la violencia que implica la separación de Elias de la ley de la madre por medio de la elaboración fallida de un sinthome. También aquí los significantes de lo abyecto amenazan con aniquilar a los sujetos, y aparecerán representados como elementos que contrastan con la limpieza del espacio doméstico, que es protegido de la invasión de lo animal y lo salvaje, a fin de resguardar el cuerpo propio."

A convenience sample was taken with a non-experimental correlational design of a transversal character. The final samples were composed of 1631 students in the year 2015, 1518 in 2016 and 1707 in 2017. The Instruments used measured depression, anxiety, stress, hopelessness, alimentary restraint, and functional social support. Reliability analysis, descriptive and polynomial contrast analysis which searched for linear and quadratic trends through ANOVA were perform. The results indicate a sustained rise in the percentages of symptomologies and a decline in the perception of social support. There are also statistically significant differences between men and women surveyed, with women showing more symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress over the three years studied. The results are concurrent with findings on a global level concerning the prevalence of mental health problems in university students. This data has allowed university professionals to better direct their efforts in supporting and treating students and promoting health in general."

The 15-hour documentation is currently deposited in the Endangered Language Archive (ELAR) and corresponds to Phase One of a long-term initiative that is currently progressing to a post-doctoral project (Phase Two). Both phases are supported and funded by the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme. Since the objective of the project is to document the endangered migratory lifestyle and language of the Pewenche people, we will reflect on how the territorial inaccessibility imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic challenged the project’s elemental strategy, which relied on several documentary journeys to the lands that are seasonally occupied by the Pewenche during the summer for transhumance purposes. We will show why the collaborative workflow sustained by self-documentation practices evolved from an auxiliary tool to a regular and essential element of the team’s current and future projects."

However, the potential impacts of chemical pollution on PAs are seldom mentioned in the scientific literature. Research on the extent of the occurrence of chemical pollution inside PAs and in-depth assessments of how chemical contaminants may adversely affect the maintenance of species abundance, species survival, and ecosystem functions are scarce to nonexistent. We investigated 1) the occurrence of chemical contaminants inside 119 PAs in Latin America from publically available databases, and 2) reviewed case studies of chemical contaminants and pollution in 4 Latin American PAs. Cases of chemical pollution and contamination inside Latin American PAs mostly originated from sources such as mining, oil, and gas extraction. To date, the focus of the research on chemical pollution research inside Latin American PAs has been primarily on the detection of contamination, typically limited to trace metals. Where management actions have occurred, they have been reactive rather than proactive. Protected areas established in wetlands are the most affected by chemical pollution. Based on the information from the pollution and/or contamination occurrence and the case studies analyzed, Latin American PAs are not well safeguarded from chemical pollution, resulting in both challenges and opportunities to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems.

Here we determine the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and some organochlorine pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorobencene (HCB), heptachlor, and endrin aldehyde in penguin excreta. Animal exposure to these environmental contaminants was determined through porphyrins in penguin droppings. Stool samples of Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) and gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) were collected on two locations of the Antarctic Peninsula area: Base O'Higgins (Antarctic Peninsula) and Ardley Island (King George Island). Despite POPs have been banned more than three decades ago, the levels (ng g-1 ww) of PCBs (1.45-2.35), DDTs (1.33-1.76), HCB (0.51-1.70), endrin (0.48-0.71) and heptachlor (0.97-2.40) showed that these pollutants are still present in Antarctica. Porphyrin levels in excreta (4.6-6.7 nmol g-1 dw) were significantly correlated to POPs, indicating certain chemical exposure on penguin colonies that inhabit the Antarctic Peninsula area. The levels of heptachlor found in penguin guano may be affecting some biota in terrestrial sites next to nesting places. Further studies and better understanding of POPs impact on animal performance in Antarctic biota are recommended."

Specifically, it focuses on the tension between the disruptive aspect of constituent power and its alleged authority. Paying special attention to the Chilean social outbreak and the constitutional process that followed, the article draws inspiration from Robert Brandom's recent work to examine a constituent moment in action and argues that the constitutional paradox can be productively addressed if the pragmatic and semantic dimensions of the constituent moment are both distinguished and harmonised. By aligning these two aspects, the article offers a novel version of a ‘relational’ approach to the paradox, revealing the potential for reconciling the disruptive and authoritative elements of a constituent moment, and providing fresh insights into the Chilean case."

So, in the first place, objections are put forward to the harmonization efforts undertaken by eclectic theories, then a retributive conception of punishment is defended, whose compatibility with the achievement of normative restoration is adequately explained to the extent that punitive practice should be understood as a ""regulatory"" institution, whose particular goal requires its operation as if it were a ""institutive"" institution. Finally, it is addressed the problem concerning the lack of a real community of interests, as fundamental presupposition in legitimizing criminal blame, indicating that the existing distance between the emancipatory theory of an institution and its effective practical operation, must be understood as the mark of a deficit in our political practices."

Then, the possibility to explain the treatment given to the different cases of criminal reiteration from the purposes posited by the different theories of punishment is analyzed. Thus, five cases of criminal reiteration are distinguished and the distinctive quality of each is determined: the apparent concurrency (including specialty cases, subsidiarity and consumption), the continuing offense, the real concurrence, recidivism and ideal concurrence. This allows analyzing the treatment that each theory of punishment should grant to every criminal reiteration case in order to support the central role attributed to criminal punishment."

The origins of the concept in Birnbaum's work are thus reviewed and the main dogmatic positions regarding the legal good's content are explained. Consequently, both the diverse theories related to a critical or material vision of the legal good -where the legal goods' protection is a condition of legitimacy- as well the theories in which said concept is identified with the ratio legis and according to which the function of Penal law is to reaffirm the validity of the infringed norm. After analyzing the theories that use new criteria and principles of legitimacy that seek to complement the role of the legal good, the article concludes attempting to show the dilemma facing the legal good theory: without independent content provided by the legislator it cannot be limited, but with independent content it rises as a countermajoritarian barrier that affects democratic principles."

Method: The sample comprised of 110 students divided into an experimental (n = 68) and a control (n = 42) group. Pre-and post-inter-vention measurements were considered, within the framework of a pilot financial education programme for students of Pedagogy of History and Geography. Analyses included Multilevel Mixed Effects Analyses, which evaluated the predicting power of attitudes towards purchasing, materialism, self-discrepancy and levels of financial literacy regarding behavioural change in responsible consumption. Results: The results set forth rationality (a subscale of attitudes toward purchasing), and centrality (a subscale of materialism) as significant predictors of behavioural changes in purchasing. Conclusions: These results suggest guidelines for interventions to promote responsible consumption in university students."

To show this approach's potential, we employ Wikipedia as a ‘reflexive tool’, i.e., an external artefact of self-observation that can help sociologists to notice conventions, biases, and blind spots within their discipline. We analyse the collective patterns of the 500 most notable sociologists on Wikipedia, performing structural, network, and text analyses of their biographies. Our exploration reveals patterns in their historical frequency, gender composition, geographical concentration, birth-death mobility, centrality degree, biographical clustering, and proximity between countries, also stressing institutions, events, places, and relevant dates from a biographical point of view. Linking these patterns in a diachronic way, we distinguish five generations of sociologists recorded on Wikipedia and emphasise the high historical concentration of the discipline in geographical areas, gender, and schools of thought. Drawing on these results, we discuss the potential of using digital repositories and methods to enhance reflexivity within sociology."

However, there is no theoretical framework to organise this complexity consistently. Based on writings by Foucault, Deleuze and Tkacz, we interpret Wikipedia as a 'field of visibility' and provide a framework to systemise its content gaps. Then we use that model to organise the complexity of the content gender gap on Wikipedia, performing a systematic overview of the asymmetries tested in empirical research. We suggest that this analysis is relevant for the effective planning of governance processes that seek to avoid female or non-male subordination in digital platforms' discourses."

This article reviews the individual conditions that favor happiness of the Latin Americans and how they could explain the apparent contradiction in the macrosocial indicators of well-being. Firstly, it is noted that for the Latin American people there is less association between economic and human development with happiness; secondly, it is suggested that greater subjective well-being in the region is due to the higher density and quality of the family ties."

It makes use of the National Socio-Economic Characterisation Survey (CASEN), which includes information about quintiles income, age, sex and overall life satisfaction. Results show that subjective well-being was higher in Magallanes than Arica and higher than the rest of country, even after controlling by age, sex and income. Differences in well-being due to sex and income are lower in Magallanes, suggesting that a strong collective identity and positive emotional climate from this region lessens the impact of status and income asymmetries. This study contributes indirect evidence about the existence of a positive social or collective regional identity in Magallanes, which acts a protective factor for well-being."
370,4,"TITLE: Nurturing and Balancing the World: A Relational Approach to Rock Art and Technology from North Central Chile (Southern Andes) | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Technology has been a central theme in archaeological discussion. Different approaches have been developed in order to understand and better explain the processes that lead to the production of objects and things. The anthropology of technology has been one such effort, with its focus on technological style and the chaîne opératoire. In this paper we argue that, despite their many contributions, these approaches tend to isolate the process of production, as well as to see it as the imposition of culture over nature. Instead, we propose a relational approach to technology, one that considers the multiple participants in the social actions involved, stressing the affective qualities of the different entities participating in the process of making. We focus this discussion on the production process of rock art in North Central Chile by Diaguita communities (c. ad 1000-c. 1540), arguing that making petroglyphs was a central activity that aimed at the balancing of the world and its participants, creating a mediating space that facilitated connectedness between the multiple members of the Diaguita world, humans and other-than-humans."
371,4,"TITLE: The dance of the lines: On the rhythms of making petroglyphs | KEYWORDS: correspondence; dance; lines; material culture; rhythms; rock art; techniques | ABSTRACT: One of the main routes that anthropology has taken to study the production of material culture has been the anthropology of techniques. Although different scholars had recognized several problems and elaborated proposals to overcome them, it is still possible to recognize a temporal, spatial and technical conception grounded on a modern ontology that emphasizes a metronomic, abstract and mechanical understanding of them. To overcome this problem, this article proposes introducing the idea of rhythm into the analysis of the production of material culture. In order to do so, the author first elaborates a rhythmical approach to techniques. After which, the article’s focus falls on the rhythms of making petroglyphs in Cuesta Pabellón, a rock art site located in the Limarí Valley, Chile. The results suggest that rock art production is a rhythmical practice that involves a bodily itineration along different gestures, intensities, pauses, disruptions and spatial orientations which resonate and correspond with the way people produce this element of material culture. It is argued that the production of rock art resembles a way of dancing in which the engraver, the emerging line, and the previous lines made by others enter into the process of correspondences in which rhythms play a substantial role."

We built a set of analytical units and variables that render visible the repetitions of technical actions and the aggregation of motifs on the blocks, tested through the analysis of a specific rock art site located along the Ponio River, in the central north of Chile. We consider the repetition of technical actions in each petroglyph and the aggregation of them per block. Bringing rhythms into the study of technology of rock art opens new pathways through which to approach a multiplicity of aspects related to how people lived and produced a spatio-temporal world."

The rock shelter in the foothills of the Southern Andes Mountains is in a semi-arid environment. Since the 1960s there has been much archaeological interest with major excavations occurring between 1960 and 1970 (Ampuero and Rivera 1971). As part of a detailed survey of the rock shelter walls, many prehistoric painted pictographs), have been discovered and recorded, probably dating to the late Holocene. In July 2013 an Anglo-Chilean/Argentinean team further explored the walls and ceilings of the rock-shelter in order to experiment with different photogrammetric recording techniques, including microscopy and post-site digital analysis. This paper gives a synopsis of the long archaeological history of the site, along with observations and analysis of a number of selected painted panels that are located within the central section of the rock shelter. The various methodologies employed assisted in further understanding the underlying reasons that would have led people to paint in this rock-shelter."

However, a third kind of mark on rock has been described in the region: linear incisions which are occasionally superimposed on petroglyphs. In this paper, the chronology and social logic of this particular kind of rock art are discussed. Through formal, stratigraphic, and technological studies we argue that these marks are an historical (post-colonial) practice which breaks the technological and visual logic of previous rock art. The characteristics of these marks suggests an intention to reject a relationship with the past, yet the reuse of ancient rocks marked with petroglyphs builds a network between past and present."

Based on the study of settlements, museum collections and rock art, a sequence of transformations and development between the Early Archaic and Inca Period is observed that differs from what is traditionally known of the area. In this time frame, social changes such as the adoption of pottery and the constitution of an agrarian way of life, occur at different paces in both time and space within the same Limari valley. We discuss spatial and representational characteristics of rock art in relation to pre-hispanic social processes, emphasizing the links between audiences, flows of information and the dynamics of social life."

With the intention of establishing categories of intensity, experimentation with different techniques, instruments and types of strokes was undertaken in order to evaluate the amount of time and work required to produce the petroglyphs. The results were compared to the rock art produced by two different societies that inhabited the semi-arid region of Chile, specifically in the Limarí valley. The results of these analyses allowed us to observe two distinct temporal organisations of rock art production, corresponding to two different types of societies: Hunter-gatherers and peasants. At the same time, we discuss the relevance of these experiments and their implications for the identified temporal differences in social terms."

The basic idea is that a social capital loss is attached to the decision to out-migrate, and said loss increases migration costs because benefits received from the local network at the origin disappear. To test this hypothesis, we estimated conditional and mixed logit models for the decision to out-migrate. The results supported the hypothesis: members from religious organizations with strong intra-community and weak intercommunity ties tended to out-migrate less than others.

Design/methodology/approach: This research adopted a qualitative approach, drawing on data collected through 26 semi-structured interviews, the revision of 4 policy documents and 15 promotional videos. The data were analysed thematically, adopting the cultural political economy framework as a lens to guide the analysis. Findings: Findings show that the problematisation of TVET’s perceived value is rooted in the system’s development history and cultural ideas. A communication campaign was one of the means to address this problem. Initial campaign messages appealed to the benefits prospective students could enjoy because of choosing TVET programs. However, later, the message gradually shifted to highlighting the collective benefits for the country, depicting TVET as a fulfilling and valuable education path. Originality/value: This article is the first to critically analyse the reasons for and use of a communication campaign to enhance the TVET’s perceived value in a global south context."
382,0,"TITLE: Reflection in Educational Interactions: analysis of scientific inquiry practices from the ALACT model Reflexión en las Interacciones Educativas: análisis de prácticas de indagación científica desde el modelo ALACT | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: In science education, educational interactions are crucial to raise alternative conceptions and move towards a responsible and literate citizenship. However, traditional scientific paradigms limit the ways in which science teachers exchange meanings about reality with their students. Therefore, science teacher reflection is an opportunity for the development of inquiry practices in accordance with current educational demands. The present hermeneutic study seeks to identify and characterize reflective elements that arise from the visualization of educational interactions through scientific inquiry activities. Stimulated recall interviews were conducted with two teachers based on video recordings of their classes, whose transcripts were analyzed using the ALACT reflective model. The results indicate that teachers reflect and mobilize their practices by rethinking interactions involving everyday worldviews, technology, dialogue, collaborative work, the value of question-answers, as well as emerging student initiatives. The realization of reflective cycles gives meaning and value to the teaching practice that, from a situated, communicative and epistemological perspective, calls for further longitudinal studies that capture the reflective trajectories of teachers in the framework of their continuous professional development."

Usually supported by international organisations, their implementation seeks to involve different stakeholders in skill formation. However, there is little empirical evidence about how key stakeholders have responded to these bodies and thus enacted the policy. This study addresses this issue and explores how employers and TVET providers have interpreted and reacted to these bodies in two sectors in Chile and if their responses fulfil the policy expectations related to skills identification and development. The findings from in-depth interviews indicate that both actors presented diverse responses to these bodies, partially fulfilling the policy expectations. Employers responded positively to the expectation of providing information on their skills needs. However, their responses have been varied to the expectation of changing their organisational practices according to sector skills standards. Similarly, TVET providers value employers’ information but do not always agree to adjust their programmes according to these standards. The article concludes by discussing enablers and barriers to fulfilling the policy expectations and questions the continuing skills supply-led approach underpinning this policy."

A longitudinal study (2010–2021) on building trust in a professional learning community of science teachers in Chile | KEYWORDS: professional development; Professional learning communities; science education; teacher collaboration; trust | ABSTRACT: Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) are valuable spaces for collaboration and reflection to promote the transformation of teaching practice and resilience to change. In PLCs that are sustained over time, trust-building is a key element. In Latin America, school systems and educational models are based on mistrust, which in Chile is consistent with a highly unequal, individualistic, and competitive school system, making the generation of PLCs particularly complex. Through a longitudinal study, we describe how trust is built and maintained in a Chilean PLC of science teachers who meet regularly to share and reflect on their practice. We analysed 18 group sessions, six focus groups, and four interviews conducted over 11 years of this PLC. The results show relevant elements to initiate trust, such as building an initial bond of trust between some participants, recognising one’s limitations, and negotiating common meanings and objectives. In the second stage, the free expression of experiences and emotions, reflecting on practice and validating its members’ experiences allows for the construction of a genuine and highly valued space for professional development, which promotes practice transformation."

Considering a Cultural Political Economy analytical approach, we use the adoption of Sector Skills Councils in three Chilean sectors (mining, wine, maintenance) to examine the different factors that explain the process. We draw on interviews with key informants at the sectoral and national levels, sectoral documents, and press articles. Our analysis shows that the framing actions of a local policy entrepreneur and their interaction with neoliberal political-economic institutions were key to explaining the policy’s attractiveness for private actors. Furthermore, economic and organisational conditions at the sectoral level explain why these three sectors adopted SSCs. We offer further insights about the TVET policy transfer process from the perspective of local and sectoral actors, and in particular, the role of non-state actors."
386,1,"TITLE: Towards a gendered STEAM education approach: building a comprehensive model to strengthen girls’ and students with non-conforming gender identities’ STEAM trajectories in Chilean public schools | KEYWORDS: comprehensive model; culturally responsive STEAM education; girls and non-conforming gender identities; participation and democracy | ABSTRACT: There is worldwide recognition of the gender gap in STEAM careers. Throughout the world, women are under-represented in STEAM jobs. The explanation for this lies much earlier in girls’ educational trajectories. The characteristics traditionally attributed to the feminine and the masculine are reproduced through the preservation of stereotypes in textbooks and teaching practices, which question the meaning of education for girls and students with non-conforming gender identities. By theoretically assuming gender not as a binary but as a mobile category that includes non-conforming gender identities, we sought in this study to construct a comprehensive model to strengthen the trajectories in STEAM areas of girls and those with non-conforming and socially marginalised gender identities in public schools in a semi-rural zone in Chile. We introduce the theoretical foundations of the model and its relevant dimensions and key indicators of development. As a result, this model (in construction) considers the following dimensions: a strategy of collective awareness-raising for the local communities; teacher education in STEAM education; implementation and use of FabLabs and a community centre; and an institutional strategy of accompaniment for schools and students. These are addressed in four moments of participatory research: diagnosis, design, implementation and validation. We discuss the challenges of developing a culturally responsive STEAM education by building a comprehensive model of the above-mentioned groups using a gendered approach that places the binary reproduction of the sex/gender system in tension with the principles of participation and democracy."

This discussion is illustrated with an experience that began in August 2020 with a master’s course and continued with the practice of teaching biology to students in a school science classroom and to teachers-to-be at the university, both with a focus on the natural, the human, and the nonbinary features of the nonhuman. Finally, the implications of these experiences for our practice and a broader context of teaching biology are discussed."

As such, the purpose of this article is to show a provocative way in which I organised my thoughts and analysis during my PhD process, attempting to engage with the sociopolitical call. In so doing, a dialogue between Paulo Freire, Judith Butler, and myself emerged as a way to understand, from a different perspective, what happened in a continuous professional development curse in which I was a teacher educator alongside a group of 12 colleagues and 21 science schoolteachers. I conclude this proposal by suggesting a new teacher–student–subject subjectivity where the double hyphen means the inseparability of the three as a subject that is learning/teaching and experiencing/becoming through an affective response."

Purpose: This study explores the conceptualisation and practice of the use of Big Ideas of science education by primary and secondary teachers in Chile. Sample: A total of 63 science teachers (a purposive sample) from pre-school, primary and secondary education in Valparaíso Region in Chile participated in the study, with 38 of them answering all the questions in the research instrument and 25 answering some of them. Design and methods: The research instrument was a questionnaire with open-ended questions. Results: The use of Big Ideas was seen as the ‘natural way’ to teach science, mostly related to the students’ daily lives. Many of the teachers had their own understanding of Big Ideas. They were very positive about Big Ideas, seeing them as a possible way of connecting with the daily lives of students and facilitating progression in students’ learning of science. The teachers also saw Big Ideas as enabling students to work collaboratively and make links between different parts of the curriculum, helping them to understand how science works, and preferable to having to teach an overloaded science curriculum that lacks such an organising framework. Conclusion: The teachers were more interested in their own creation and development of Big Ideas rather than simply adopting the existing, official published framework and adhering to what is said in the Chilean curriculum regarding the approach of Big Ideas. These results indicate the need to explore in-depth such varied conceptualisations of schoolteachers regarding the approach of Big Ideas. In turn, this can offer empirical insights into the way Big Ideas are treated in policy documents in Chile and elsewhere."

The thesis aimed to explore the visions of pre-service biology teachers and teacher educators regarding sex education and gender diversities, recognising the relationship between those subjects and their possible tensions. In the thesis production cycle, there was an attempt to decolonise sex education in pre-service teacher education, a process of decolonising the context of academic supervision happened too. This paper illustrates the research process’ particularities, especially how queering [enfletando] the supervision process incorporated decolonial cracks through fleta reflexivity."

This article aims to illustrate another way of organizing and being in academia with a concrete example of multicultural, collaborative, and multidisciplinary work towards decolonizing how we position ourselves in shaping a feminist and inclusive practice. Educational resources developed by an international foundation were adapted to a combined/blended teaching-learning format, considering the conditions of distance education during the health emergency scenario caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The resources were developed incorporating gender perspective, inclusive approach, and aspects of our Latin American identity. This work was carried out collaboratively with specialists from different Latin American countries. Given the current scenario of global challenges, collaborative work between countries allows us to rescue strategies and solutions with a territorial stamp, highlighting our knowledge and putting it at the service of educational resources relevant to each context and science education."
392,0,"TITLE: Facing neoliberalism through dialogic spaces as sites of hope in science education: experiences of two self-organised communities | KEYWORDS: Communities; Democratising dialogue; Hope; Neoliberalism; Science teachers | ABSTRACT: In this paper, we discuss the role of dialogue in two layers; first, in relation to two self-organised communities of science teachers in which we participated and, second, our process of coming together during our PhDs to analyse these communities, a dialogue about the dialogue. Regarding the first layer, there is much to learn from science teachers and science teacher educators when they are organised in sites of learning that can be spaces of hope, beginnings, and becoming, as is illustrated in the case of these two self-organised communities. Regarding the second layer, we discuss the value of dialogue and the possibilities it offers to develop ideas for science education in a way that might be democratising, emancipatory, and offering counter-narratives in a neoliberal Chile. By engaging in this dialogue revisiting the practices of our communities, we gained a sense of agency within the field of science education. However, we realised that we need to move towards a critical view within our communities, and more contextual and transformative science education by translating these sites of hope to our educational praxis today. For us, this relates both to developing a collective view of how to make science education provide pedagogical conditions and experiences for critical and engaged citizenship and thinking how we can act and engage with different settings in solidarity. One way of moving towards this is by developing a political knowledge of our disciplines through a collective scientific conscientisation. Our communities are the departure points to achieve this."
393,0,"TITLE: Developing biology teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge through learning study: the case of teaching human evolution | KEYWORDS: learning study; nature of science; Pedagogical content knowledge; professional development programme; teaching human evolution | ABSTRACT: This work explores how pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) on evolution was modified by two biology teachers who participated in a professional development programme (PDP) that included a subsequent follow-up in the classroom. The PDP spanned a semester and included activities such as content updates, collaborative lesson planning, and the presentation of planned lessons. In the follow-up part, the lessons were videotaped and analysed, identifying strategies, activities, and conditions based on student learning about the theory of evolution. Data were collected in the first round with an interview before the training process, identifying these teachers’ initial content representation (CoRe) for evolution. Then, a group interview was conducted after the lessons, and, finally, an interview of stimulated recall with each teacher was conducted regarding the subject taught to allow teachers to reflect on their practice (final CoRe). This information was analysed by the teachers and the researchers, reflecting on the components of the PCK, possible changes, and the rationale behind their actions. The results show that teachers changed their beliefs and knowledge about the best methods and strategies to teach evolution, and about students’ learning obstacles and misconceptions on evolution. They realised how a review of their own practices promotes this transformation."

The last three decades have seen a growing diversification of theoretical and methodological approaches to lithic studies, as well as new analytical techniques, used to study issues including lithic production systems, technical variability, tool manufacturing and management, raw material economy and circulation, among others. Recent studies on lithic industries are exemplified by discussing Southernmost Patagonia's first human occupations, dated ∼13,000 cal BP, and Middle Holocene early marine explorations, dated ∼8000–7000 cal BP. An overview and comparison of Southernmost Patagonia's early hunter-gatherer lithic technologies is made."

Although the zooarchaeological context is largely concordant with summer hunting forays, the preparation and use of diverse lithic artefacts suggests other activities were performed at the site, besides its use as a hunting stand. A 2720±25 BP radiocarbon date at the base indicates also that this area was occupied earlier and perhaps more regularly than previously thought. Although the relationship with the eastern plains is confirmed, we observe also the use of local raw materials."

The article tackles the cases of Chile and the United States, both countries in which neoliberal economic policies are linked with the expansion of tough criminal policies. With regards to values, the analysis suggests that prison privatization promotes a tainted commercial alliance between the State and private sector, generates a deep conflict of legitimacy and fosters an unsustainable concept of the common good. In terms of results, prison privatization, in all of its forms, has failed to fulfill the promise of relieving States' budgets and providing decent incarceration conditions. Without empirical reasons to sustain prison privatization, the article concludes by highlighting the need of an ideological debate of the values implicated in this manifestation of neoliberal penality."

Although the topic has also been treated by others (other terms used are ""standing high jump""or ""squat jump""), the present paper shows how a smartphone can be used to capture video of a jump and determine the jump height. A crucial assumption often made in analysis of the SVJ is the constancy of force or acceleration during the stand-up phase. This is, however, not a trivial assumption in view of the changing geometrical configuration of the legs during standing up. We show that indeed the acceleration of the center of mass is nearly constant during the stand-up phase of the jump, a finding that has so far only been possible by much more expensive measurements (force plates)."

In current studies on social-ecological systems linked with trees, we commonly find two approaches: the first focuses on ‘biological entities’, examining the ecological dynamics of tree species and associated biodiversity. The second approach focuses on people, analyzing ‘human agency’ along with historical and contemporary political or other forces shaping human-tree relationships. In this paper, we explore social-ecological systems associated with the Pewen (Araucaria araucana), one of the most iconic and sacred trees from the southern Andes. We first describe some of our own research findings on Pewen for both approaches described above. We then develop a third perspective, that we call ‘relational’, which highlights biocultural relations and has the potential to overcome both the ‘ecological/social’ and the ‘biological entity/human agency’ dichotomies. Our relational approach allows a closer enquiry on how actors (e.g. trees and their seeds, wildlife, and people, among others) interact in complex and sympoietic biocultural networks, recognizing the biocultural memory of the system that emerges as an on-going complex of dynamics relations that must be enacted and performed on a daily basis. Furthermore, it stresses that people-pewen networks are continuously built and rebuilt in open systems subjected to historical and contemporary drivers of change."

Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile) has a complex societal and ecological history and marine resources have always been exploited; nevertheless, little is known about relationships between these resources and Rapanui islanders. This study aims to explore the historical and contemporary role of sea turtles on Rapa Nui, contrasting it with information from other Pacific region societies. We triangulated information through a literature review, semi-structured interviews, and participant observations. Our results show a strong cultural connection between Rapa Nui and other Pacific islands, with turtles represented in their art, culture, mythology, symbolism, popular traditions, and ritual and spiritual life. Use of these animals on Rapa Nui has varied historically, and nowadays turtle consumption is widely rejected among Rapanui community members. Currently, sea turtles have a crucial role in tourism, constituting an opportunity for local development, further knowledge, and conservation of natural heritage."

This is particularly true for developing economies with fragile institutions. In this context, recent studies on Indian pharmaceutical markets provide evidence suggesting that the sector is a hub for substandard quality of medicines. Departing from these prior studies which use randomly collected samples, we reinvestigate this question using novel pan-India market sales data of banned medicines from 0.75 million pharmacists and chemists in India. We find that indeed such medicines get sold in India even after bans are imposed on them in the period 2007 to 2013. However, there is a general decline in demand post ban for our focal molecules suggesting broad adherence to bans. We also observe regional heterogeneity in prevalence of banned medicines sold between rich and poor regions of India with the former counterintuitively showing more sales. That said, while Ozawa et al. (2018) argue that prevalence of substandard medicines is around 13% in low and middle-income countries, we find an infringement ratio which is more muted in India at about 5%. Finally, a regression-based examination suggests that prior firm presence in therapeutic markets and popularity of molecules positively impact the likelihood of sale of banned medicines in India. Our results are robust to alternative explanations and are substantiated with a theoretical set up examining firm trade-offs in the decision to infringe. India has recently been under the lens of the global access to medicines debate and our findings have important policy implications for global health."

Through a critical reading, different institutional documents related to education and school philosophy are explored to show the weak transformation that the subject has undergone since the dictatorship. Firstly, the notions of critical thinking and citizenship corroborate the continuity of the main ideas of Pinochet's education, namely the naturalised link between the market and democracy as the main axes of citizenship education. Secondly, the current curricular bases are presented and an analysis of the influence that different social actors in philosophy had in their construction is proposed. The third part explores the curricular prioritisation of philosophy in the pandemic context, emphasising the relevance given to the psychological dimension of students to the detriment of philosophising as a practice of collective thought. And, fourthly, a political-philosophical analysis of the document Educating philosophically in times of crisis is developed, in which new meanings are presented and, therefore, didactic forms of Philosophy that argues the idea of the knowledge-producing subject of the current programmes."

Southern Chilean elites come from European immigration, settled in the territory and actively participating in the economic, political, social, cultural and institutional life of their communities and territorial spaces. This exploratory-descriptive quantitative research focuses on the educational space given its relevance in the conformation and reproduction of the elites, and investigates the transition from school to university of students from private schools in the southern zone, describing the main transformations and continuities of this transition for the period 2011-2021. The results show an important heterogeneity, which expresses distinctions and verticalities within this reduced group, explained by the independent variables considered, exhibiting similarities and discontinuities over time (compared with itself) and with the central zone of the country."

The working hypothesis was that empathy among two individuals translates into a synchronic process impacting on pitch values. This was studied by recording 27 dyadic interactions assigned to one of two experimental conditions (labeled as Empathic and Non-Empathic). The evolution of pitch in time was observed in some of the questions used to guide the conversations. In each conversation pitch was analyzed for both participants to determine whether phonetic convergence occurred or not. Descriptive and inferential analyses were implemented, the results being consistent with the manipulation devised to distinguish each experimental condition. The final data support the existence of a relation between some phonetic features of speech and dispositional dimensions that although typically overlooked by classical models of cognition are largely present in everyday interactions. Also data support the idea of a stronger empathy effect on mixed-gender dyads than on same-gender dyads."

This component has been characterized as a negative deflection which responds differentially to profits and losses in terms of expected and unexpected outcomes. Thus, while some studies have defined the idea of ""expected outcome"" as the probability to win vs. to lose, others have defined it as the expected size of rewards. How these alternative interpretations of ""expected outcome"" affect the fERN's research, and the effects of their interaction under a specific model of ""expected value"" has not been properly assessed. This work contextualizes the general study of neural mechanisms involved in decisionmaking processes, putting the fERN studies in context; besides, it reviews the two main approaches to its research; and finally, it explores the possibilities to further expand the fERN studies, in the context of the transdisciplinary rising field of neuroeconomics."

This difference, which in principle appears to be merely technical and based on better computer performance issues, gets political and social standing, reclaiming values such as collaboration and altruism. Results reveal novelties about the features of classical social movements, mainly about their organization, the degree of participation and the roles of their constituency, the diffusion of their principles and the way in which they observe societal changes."
412,6,"TITLE: Trans-Sector Livelihood Resilience in an Urban Small-Scale Fishing Community | KEYWORDS: Cancun; coastal development; ethnography; Mexico; small-scale fishery; urbanisation | ABSTRACT: Many coastal small-scale fishing (SSF) communities in low and middle-income countries are experiencing urbanisation due to global development and migration patterns. Scholars have documented how processes related to urbanisation present SSF communities with a unique series of opportunities and challenges. However, it is still poorly understood how SSF communities perceive and pursue resilience while adapting to these changing conditions. To address this gap, we conduct ethnographic research among the members of a fishing cooperative in Cancun, Mexico. We find that four factors related to Cancun’s pattern of development have incentivized local fishers to adopt a trans-sector perspective of livelihood resilience through which they view fishing as a lucrative but fleeting opportunity, with some actively planning a transition to non-fishing livelihoods. These four factors are the depletion of local fisheries, rising land values, the proliferation of non-fishing livelihood opportunities, and regional migration patterns. Whether local fishers ultimately prove resilient to the stresses of urbanisation depends partly upon the degree to which local governance and support systems align with this perspective. By contextualizing these findings within the broader literature on SSFs and urban development, we develop a heuristic to hypothesize to what extent these findings are generalizable beyond the study context."
413,6,"TITLE: An archipelago with sphere potential: the anatomy of the community in an intermediate city in Chile ¿Un archipiélago con potencial de esfera?: anatomía de lo comunitario en una ciudad intermedia de Chile | KEYWORDS: associativity; community networks; Community sphere; intermediary city; sociability | ABSTRACT: Assuming the approach of the production of the common and community frameworks, this article explores the “anatomy” of the community in the city of Talca (Chile). Based on the analysis of data from a probabilistic survey applied in 2023, we propose that – despite their strong presence in the different areas observed – community networks have a limited capacity to produce the common beyond the area of daily life. While family relationships act as a force that attracts subjects to familiar, safe environments, making it difficult for them to expand their relational circles, in the neighborhood and work environment, relationships of daily collaboration and closeness are privileged, over those that imply an associative commitment. Faced with this, we pose the challenge of generating greater porosity and articulation between daily community relations and the associative forms that exist at different territorial scales and thematic areas."

This has its origin in a sociopolitical process that has fostered a heteronomous, contained, depoliticized and bureaucratized organizational culture, sustained by a neoliberal idea of neighborhood-community and framed in legislation that does not recognize its public function. But in the last fifteen years this hegemonic form has given way to more articulated and flexible community experiences, which discuss the scales of action, the type of relationship with the State and the established modes of organization. Integrating results from research carried out between 2014 and 2023, the article identifies potential for the transformation of community culture expressed in forms of networks that occur in different areas and scales: primary ties and daily neighborhood life, territorial-based organizations and heterogeneous territorial networks. The above allows us to propose the idea-horizon of the Community Sphere, which would allow us to discuss the fragmentation with which the community is observed and experienced in current Chile."

Casos en Concepción y Talca (Chile)* | KEYWORDS: collective needs; community networks; Community sphere; sociohealth crisis | ABSTRACT: From a relational perspective of the community, we explore the relationships that allowed sustaining life in spaces of proximity during the Covid-19 pandemic in Chile. From a qualitative methodology and the study of cases, one in Concepción and the other in Talca, it is observed that in the face of the rupture of daily life, community relationships are reconfigured to adapt to the new scenario. This plasticity allows them to adapt their production of relational goods to meet needs arising in the crisis and, thus, their action replaces and/or complements state and mercantile actions that diminish their protagonism. Finally, these multiple relationships and the goods they produce can be understood as a social sphere with its own meaning: the community. This plays a central role in the satisfaction of individual and collective needs and the reproduction of life, particularly in contexts of crisis."
416,6,"TITLE: Resisting the neo-liberal neighbourhood's straitjacket: Relational neighbourhood geographies in Chile and Spain | KEYWORDS: Barcelona (Spain); relational neighbourhood geographies; social networks; Talca (Chile); urban community | ABSTRACT: This article proposes a critical and complex reading of the configuration and reconfiguration of the neighbourhood (barrio) based on a comparative analysis of two case studies in Spain and Chile. Neighbourhood life is assumed to be organised around complex, open and dynamic relationships articulated in different relational geographies and not limited to a restricted space-time frame. We propose the concept of 'relational neighbourhood geographies', understanding it as an expansive and malleable socio-spatial field. In both case studies we observe that relational neighbourhood geographies exist beyond the limits of geographically narrow territories and can be expanded by constructing new geographies and territorialities. Consequently, the configuration of the neighbourhood is relationally conditioned by the forms and dynamics that weak and strong ties adopt in given spaces and times. The historical analysis of our case studies shows ways in which relationality is context-sensitive and how bottom-up resistance produces relationality. Although the importance of the relational is observed in both cases, their characterisation, intensity and complexity are different, which creates distinct capacities to produce territorialities and engage and impact city politics."

We highlight those fostered by feminist organizations, i.e. actions motivated exclusively by women, who propose to be mutually supportive to tackle multidimensional vulnerability increased by the pandemic. Thus, this paper explores three communitarian actions led by feminists in three Chilean cities from the center-south zone (Rancagua, Talca and Chillán), in order to learn and understand their arrangements to deal with the most urgent needs during the pandemic. This exploration was developed through online interviews with some leaders of the three initiatives. Among the main findings, we found a strong conviction for politicizing the intimate sphere, constructing a network of solidarity deemed safe for women, which allows them to stick together against any adversity. All this takes place across horizontal social relations, and mutual and self-care."

Nou Barris (Barcelona) y Las Américas (Talca, Chile) | KEYWORDS: Community; Neighborhood; Social networks; Territory | ABSTRACT: In the framework of the neoliberal agenda and its re-escalation policies, the neo-ecological conception of the neighborhood was assumed in the 1980s by various governments in America and Europe. From there it has been consolidating as a hegemonic conception of the neighborhood. This article argues, however, that the neighborhood is only one of the possible ways of structuring urban local relations. From a relational understanding of the neighborhood sphere, we assume that it can produce different lattice structures at a given time and space. These ve neighborhood geographies'will in turn produce various forms of territoriality. From this perspective, two cases are reviewed, one in Chile and one in Spain. In them, neighborhood relations cross the limits imposed by the notion of neighborhood and climb, weaving geographies of more complex relationships and territorialities with greater power to influence the urban. We conclude that a more complex neighborhood geography, which articulates different scales, makes social actors more capable of influencing urban governance."
420,6,"TITLE: The neighborhood action beyond the neighborhood: The case of Nou Barris district in Barcelona La acción vecinal más allá del barrio: el caso del distrito Nou Barris en Barcelona | KEYWORDS: Geographies of neighborhood action; Neighborhood; Neighborhood networks; Neoliberal urbanism | ABSTRACT: The neoecological conception of the neighborhood was adopted in the 1980s by various governments in Europe using the framework of the neoliberal agenda. Assumed in an uncritical way as a privileged (if not unique) scale for urban governance, the idea of the neighborhood has both legitimized and institutionalized a fragmented and depoliticized neighborhood action, with little capacity to produce an urban context. From a critical position to this notion of neighborhood and its implicit way of conceiving relations between communities and urban policies, this article proposes a multiscale and political approach of the neighborhood, by applying the concept of geographies of neighborhood action. To illustrate this approach, the case of the district of Nou Barris, in Barcelona, is analyzed, where the actions of the organizations go beyond the limits of the hegemonic notion of the neighborhood, constituting more complex relationships and broader territorialities that seek to influence the urban. It is concluded that the neighborhood action can adopt different 'geographies' and constitute new relational configurations not constrained by limiting spatialities. It can scale its fields of action from the immediate residential proximity to the entire city, and play a key role in intermediating between the everyday life and the political system."

This historic process of neighborhood empowerment was abruptly interrupted due to the coup d’état in 1973. The post-dictatorship era did not mean a re-articulation of the neighborhood power. Instead, the collective faculty to discuss and modify the neoliberal urban agenda was further undermined. Nonetheless, a scenario favorable to the public discussion about the neighborhood issues and their role in building the right to the city and democracy is nowadays evinced. In this context –and analyzing experiences of reshaping the frameworks for the neighborhood collective action– this article proposes that, as the neighborhood space is a key political arena for the production of the urban, reconstituting the neighborhood influencing power can contribute to institute new ways of relations between citizens and urban policies."
422,6,"TITLE: Fragmentation policies vs. Articulation practices: Limitations and challenges of the neighborhood as a neoliberal planning device in Chile Políticas de fragmentación vs. prácticas de articulación: Limitaciones y retos del barrio como dispositivo de planificación neoliberal en Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Neighborhood; Neoliberal planning; Open neighborhood | ABSTRACT: The dominant neighborhood conception, based on the neo-ecological approach of the Chicago School, assumes that neighborhood relations occur in delimited spaces, virtually disconnected from urban totalities and around significantly homogeneous and cohesive communities. This article demonstrates that: 1) In Chile, the ideological use of this neighborhood concept has become hegemonic in public policies and in the academic sphere, has legitimized and reproduced the fragmentation of the associative social fabric, and has reduced the capacity of the actors to participate in the production of the urban; and 2) In spite of the institutionalized restrictions, it is possible to dispute the meaning of the neighborhood based on territorial praxis. The article analyzes two case studies in which, from a fragmented organizational base, the actors were able to articulate themselves in ways that made their spatial frames more complex, diversified the forms and levels of linkage, and improved the communities' capacity for advocacy. Both cases show that neighborhood relations can be understood beyond the predominant idea of neighborhood, that is, not constrained by physical delimitations (what we call 'closed neighborhood'), but with expansive flexibility beyond them ('open neighborhood'); not limited to homogeneous communities, but organized in networks that articulate different types and modalities of community."
423,24,"TITLE: Contesting TINA: Community Planning Alternatives for Disaster Reconstruction in Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; community planning; disaster (un)fix; earthquake; neoliberal reconstruction; Talca | ABSTRACT: Talca, Chile, has been negatively impacted by both a major 2010 earthquake and the ensuing reconstruction process. Talca’s poor have been forced out from their neighborhoods and relocated to remote areas where employment, public transportation, and basic services are limited. Based on extensive community development work in Talca, this article analyzes the dynamics that have led to these conditions and the insufficiently supported alternative community-based initiatives that could have allowed Talca to redevelop in more sustainable and equitable ways. Planners need to systemically understand the implications of programs often pushed in times of emergency as urgent and inevitable that may not favor a healthy long-term redevelopment of communities recovering from disasters, be politically savvy and courageous to denounce and resist them when necessary, and work with/for communities to define and promote more just and sustainable postdisaster futures."

Drawing upon the categories of old and new regions, as well as functional and deep identities (Passi, 2011; Terlouw, 2011), the territorial effects related to the Chilean process of regionalization, started in the 1970s are reviewed. Using different sources of information, the inequalities generated in the territory by this process are shown, conceptualized as the constitution of the new region, based in the two main cities of the region; and the precarization of the old region, represented by the old provinces. The first region is developed at the expense of the second one. Despite these differences, two hybridations are observed; the new region includes the old one, and vice versa. It is concluded that the management of this dichotomy is key to the processes of regional development."

Drawing upon direct observation of four experiences of parties and fairs in the city of Talca (Chile), and interviews with their organizers and participants, we attempt to understand the possibilities and limitations of festive occupations of the space, in terms of their ability to intervene and activate the neighbourhoods&#39; collective life. We conclude that public parties are actually able to stimulate processes of neighbourhood identification and community empowerment, as long as they: 1) imply the construction of a mobilizing discourse and purpose; 2) are based on a flexible administration model of self-management; 3) have a territorial orientation; and 4) generate processes of learning directed at the action itself."
426,-1,"TITLE: Ethical living: relinking ethics and consumption through care in Chile and Brazil | KEYWORDS: care; choice; Ethical consumption; ethical living; everyday life practices; sustainability | ABSTRACT: Mainstream conceptualizations of ‘ethical consumption’ equate the notion with conscious, individual, market-mediated choices motivated by ethical or political aims that transcend ordinary concerns. Drawing on recent sociology and anthropology of consumption literature on the links between ordinary ethics and ethical consumption, this article discusses some of the limitations of this conceptualization. Using data from 32 focus groups conducted in Chile and Brazil, we propose a conceptualization of ethical consumption that does not centre on individual, market-mediated choices but understands it at the level of practical outcomes, which we refer to as different forms of ‘ethical living’. To do that, we argue, we need to depart from the deontological understanding of ethics that underpins mainstream approaches to ethical consumption and adopt a more consequentialist view focusing on ethical outcomes. We develop these points through describing one particular ordinary moral regime that seemed to be predominant in participants’ accounts of ethics and consumption in both Chile and Brazil: one that links consumption and ethics through care. We show that the moral regime of care leads to ‘ethical outcomes’, such as energy saving or limiting overconsumption, yet contrary to the mainstream view of ethical consumption emphasizing politicized choice expressed through markets, these result from following ordinary ethics, often through routines of practices."

The reconstruction after the 2010 earthquake and tsunami responded to the emergency largely according to these same principles. While official reports on the reconstruction effort show a state that is complying with its goals, evidence from fieldwork in the city of Constitución illustrates that this method is highly inadequate in the context of a natural disaster. Chile should establish a social policy structure for natural disasters that allows for a rapid response to a social emergency based on universal or near-universal allocation criteria."
429,-1,"TITLE: Human development and decent Work: Why some concepts succeed and others fail to make an impact | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This article examines the impact of the International Labour Organization's concept of Decent Work on development thinking and the academic literature. We attempt to answer the question of what makes a development initiative successful by comparing the decent work approach to the United Nation Development Programme's Human Development concept (in conjunction with the human development indicator). We consider that the latter has been one of the most successful development concepts ever to have been launched, while the impact of decent work by comparison has been limited. Our hypothesis relating to the question of what makes a development initiative successful has three fundamental components: first, a solid theoretical foundation has to justify the launch of a development concept. A second vital factor is the availability of sufficient national and internationally comparable data that enables researchers and policy makers alike to apply the concept, preferably by means of a synthetic indicator. Third, the political will and institutional structure of the development institution that launches a concept is a key factor, particularly if data availability is limited as countries then have to be persuaded to generate new data."
430,-1,"TITLE: Beyond the “deficit discourse”: Mapping ethical consumption discourses in Chile and Brazil | KEYWORDS: Ethical consumption; everyday consumption; Latin America; south and north | ABSTRACT: This article challenges the longstanding trend of much empirical material on ethical consumption originating from the global North, offering instead rich data on ethical consumption and practices in Chile and Brazil. Drawing on data generated from 32 in-depth focus groups (179 participants in total) in both countries, the article identifies similarities and differences between these two countries and with the global North. We identify how ethical consumption in Chile and Brazil is conceptualized mainly at two different scales, namely first, the everyday ethics of consumption at household scale and, second, a more global scale of discourse on environmental problems and the negative effects of globalisation. At the household scale, narrative themes include those of prudence, of avoiding overconsumption, family health, and focus on quality. At a more national and international scale, respondents from all classes in both countries discussed labour conditions associated with Chinese imports. Further, particularly university-educated and well-travelled respondents had adopted international environmentalist discourses. Employing a relational geography to discourses, the article calls for research to both include and transcend cross-country comparisons, and binaries of global North and South."

The design was instrumental. A total of 2,516 adolescents from two previous projects were part of the study. The offender sub-sample (25.36%) was recruited by non-probabilistic convenience sampling and the non-offender (74.64%) by proportional and stratified by conglomerates sampling. We identified 47 items that are risk factors for delinquency and antisocial outcomes, and we grouped them into six theoretical dimensions. We obtained good content coherence, acceptable internal consistency, adequate factor structure, convergent associations with theoretically related constructs, and predictive capacity for some dimensions. The logistic regression analysis showed that adolescents who accumulated more risk factors had an augmented risk of being an offender. The hierarchical multiple regression indicated that four of the six dimensions were predictors of violent antisocial behavior. As evidence of three validity sources and reliability were demonstrated, we recommend using the scale for detecting events that are risk factors of antisocial and delinquent behavior in adolescents and for intervention to prevent violent criminal and antisocial conduct."

This research, developed over more than two decades, first qualitatively and then quantitatively, allows identifying particularities in the process of identity construction, which make it possible to propose a criminal identity formed during a long-standing process in children and adolescents who live through the experience of social maladjustment, showing different persistent trajectories over time. In adolescents who construct an identity that validates delinquency as a way of life, although risk factors are identified at various levels, similar to those highlighted in the literature, in the reality studied there are important contextual conditions (family dynamics, neighbourhood conditions, school experiences and intervention programmes, etc.) that play a relevant role in validating and reinforcing this identity."

However, its effectiveness in improving academic performance remains inconclusive. Objective: This study investigates the impact of FF on student perceptions and academic performance in an undergraduate anatomy course using a mixed-methods approach. Methods: A convergent parallel design was employed, integrating qualitative and quantitative analyses. Qualitative data from open-ended questionnaires and focus groups were analyzed through thematic coding using ATLAS.ti, resulting in 140 initial codes, later refined into 34 key themes. A coding network was constructed to map students' perceptions. Quantitative analysis compared students' pre- and post-feedback academic performance using paired Student's t-tests in GraphPad Prism 9.0. Results: Qualitative findings indicate that students perceive FF as beneficial for reinforcing anatomical concepts, improving study techniques, and fostering self-regulated learning. However, concerns about superficiality, lack of specificity, and cognitive overload were frequently mentioned. Quantitative analysis revealed no significant differences in grades before and after FF implementation, suggesting that while FF is valued by students, it does not necessarily translate into measurable academic gains in the short term. Conclusion: FF positively impacts student engagement, motivation, and learning strategies, yet its academic benefits may depend on feedback structure, specificity, and integration into assessment frameworks. Enhancing dialogic and visually supported feedback mechanisms may optimize FF's effectiveness in anatomy education."

To achieve this, two HBCWs consisting of a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland, followed by a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (VSSF-HSSF) were evaluated. Two saturation levels were used: (a) partially saturated HB1:VSSF1 (0.6 m)-HSSF1 (0.15 m), (b) saturated HB2: VSSF2 (0.8 m)-HSSF2 (0.25 m). Each unit was planted with Schoenoplectus californicus and was operated for 297 days. The removal efficiencies in HB1 and HB2 were above 70%, 86%, 77% and 55% for chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), nitrogen as ammonium (NH4+-N), and total nitrogen (TN), respectively. For VSSF, a higher level of saturation (from 0.6 to 0.8 m) meant a decrease of 17% in the TN removal efficiencies, and for HSSF, an increase from 0.15 to 0.25 m of saturation meant a decrease of 11 and 10% in the NH4+-N and TN removal efficiencies, respectively. Thus, the increase of saturation level in HBCWs reduces the transformation and/or removal of components of the wastewaters to be treated, particularly nitrogen. Through this research, the possibility of optimizing the transformation of nitrogen with partially saturated hybrids can be examined."

This analysis was carried out in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of a rural community where they implemented two technologies in parallel: AS and a pilot plant of horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) constructed wetlands. In this case, these systems were fed by the same influent and the removal efficiencies of 14 OMPs, including analgesics/anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, stimulants, antifungals, fragrances, plasticizers, and transformation products, were evaluated in each system. Regarding the presence of OMPs in the wastewater, the concentrations of these compounds in the influent ranged from 0.16 to 7.75 μg/L. In general, the removal efficiencies achieved by the AS system were between 10%-95% higher than those values reported by HSSFs with values above 80% for naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, caffeine, triclosan, methyl dihydrojasmonate, bisphenol-A, 2-hydroxyl ibuprofen, and carboxy ibuprofen (p < 0.05). This behavior can be related to the aerobic conditions that promote the AS system with oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) values above -281 mV and 0.24 mg/L, respectively. However, the removal of galaxolide was greater in HSSF system than in AS with significant difference of 70% (p < 0.05). Despite these results, this study reveals that comparing both technologies, AS had the best removal performance of these OMPs studied."

It explains how women's international organisations presented reports and information about human rights abuses during Genera Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship (1973–1990). By using their publications, oral interviews, memoirs and press reports, the study sheds light on the extensive efforts deployed by the WILPF and WIDF to disseminate knowledge and promote actions designed to improve the lives of Chilean women. The article shows that women's international organisations promoted inclusive ideas of rights, including women's particular experiences under military rule, and that such efforts built in the organisations' previous experiences of human rights activism."

Networking, mentoring, and support groups play a major role in bettering women’s careers in the security industry. Learning from peers and superiors, sharing ideas, and working toward common goals outside the workspace allow people the opportunity to explore and understand the specific skills sets required to grow as a professional."

The article aims to demonstrate that this theory is evidence for a movement toward cooperative values, instead of individualism, as the base to face human problems. In that sense, the ""social philosophy"" that underlies his socialist proposal would have been clearly developed in his first widely distributed intellectual work."
445,3,"TITLE: Public transport and urban structure | KEYWORDS: Income groups sorting; Mode choice; Monocentric city model; Public transport | ABSTRACT: Public transport is central to commuting in most cities. This paper studies the role of public transportation in shaping the urban structure. Its main contribution is to propose a tractable model as a tool to study urban regulations and transport policies in the long-run. Using the classic monocentric city framework, we model public transport as a mode that can only be accessed by walking to a set of stops. By incorporating a discrete transport mode choice and income heterogeneity, the model remains simple yet can reproduce non-monotonous urban gradients observed in cities with public transport, and well-observed spatial patterns of sorting by income and use of public transport. For example, it can reproduce an inverted U-shape of transit usage along the city. To highlight the relevance of the model, we study the effects of pricing pollution externalities together with extending the public transportation network on the urban structure."
446,3,"TITLE: The Mohring Effect | KEYWORDS: Access time costs; Bus provision; Mohring Effect; Public transportation; Public transportation pricing; Public transportation subsidization; Urban transportation; Waiting time costs | ABSTRACT: The Mohring Effect is the result that an increase in the demand for public transportation induces a decrease in the waiting time costs for all users when it is dealt with an increase in the frequency of the services. The use of the term Mohring Effect is also associated with other positive indirect effects of increased demand, such as an increase in route density that leads to reductions in access time costs. The Mohring Effect, which is, to some extent, analogous to a positive externality, is the most important argument from an economic efficiency standpoint for public transport subsidization. Recent empirical evidence shows that between 50% and 60% of the optimal subsidy for off-peak bus services in cities such as Washington, Los Angeles, and London is due to the Mohring Effect. The evidence also shows that the Mohring Effect is more significant for buses than rail and subways and for off-peak periods than for peak periods."

Based on the analysis of press articles and other documentary sources, I describe the role played by the main fraction of the Partido Colorado (Red Party) led by Luis Batlle Berres in promoting polarisation of the Uruguayan political system in those years. My findings contradict the conventional depiction of Batlle Berres as a moderate who tried to prevent the polarisation provoked by other agents."

Established in 1910, the NPA was a pioneering government social policy for the time and for the region. Some have argued that the design of the NPA law followed the secular and republican model instituted in France at the end of the nineteenth century when France established the Assistance Publique, particularly regarding the extent of public assistance to the poor, the role of the state in the provision of health care (as opposed to charity-based provision) and the centralization of health-care services (as opposed to a decentralized health-care system). We analyze how these revolutionary ideas were discussed by the technicians and politicians who participated in the process that culminated in the approval of the law in Uruguay discussed these revolutionary ideas. We explore the factors that motivated the creation of the commission that developed the law. We also review available documentation on the drafting of the bill and the parliamentary debate that culminated in its approval. We find that the design of the NPA included many ideas diffused mainly from France. The French model was not simply emulated, however. Rather, the authors of the NPA thoroughly analyzed and considered the features and main consequences of the Assistance Publique, suggesting that diffusion in this case was more a process of learning than of simple mimicry."

This paper analyzes this process, paying special attention to the political dynamics between the new multi party coalition government and the opposition, under the regional context of the rise of conser-vative parties. The paper shows that the new government managed to take advantage of the pandemic to successfully implement its agenda of reforms both in terms of effectiveness, the cohesion of the ruling coalition and the evaluation of public opinion. At the beginning of 2021, the deterioration of health, social and economic indicators poses a more complex scenario for the government."

This article analyzes the effect of local democratic institution building on the political attitudes and behavior of citizens living in small towns in Uruguay. More specifically, using a natural experiment design, this research seeks to establish the causal impact of recently established elections of local authorities on individuals' political engagement. It develops a comparative case study analyzing the consequences of this institutional innovation in two towns. It shows that individuals from the town where citizens have the opportunity to elect their local authorities have more positive attitudes toward politics than those from the town without such elections."

On the basis of the typology introduced in this special issue, we conclude that the PDC has oscillated between the ""progressive"" and ""conservative"" types. Meanwhile, the UDI represents an uncontested example of the conservative type. However, both parties share a number of traits. First, they both emerged as youth movements in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, where a sizable portion of the country's elite are educated. Second, they both represented movements that sought to break with established political forces, by occupying a specific (and untapped) ideological niche, and by engaging in innovative mobilization strategies. Third, a short time after their creation, both parties witnessed rapid electoral growth, which they consolidated over time. Both parties remain electorally successful today, even in the wake of increasing levels of secularization in Chilean society. Our comparative analysis of both parties describes their historical trajectory in the party system, as well as their contemporary organizational and ideological characteristics. We also analyse each party's doctrinaire influences and their relation to the Chilean and global Catholic Church. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

We are interested in knowing who these women were, what organizations and demands they built, and how they articulated with other movements or political parties. The article stresses, from a decolonial and intersectional feminist perspective, the struggle for local civil and political rights, in a context of consolidation of the Chilean nation-state in Wallmapu, with its colonialist and racist practices. Methodologically, we work with documentary and content analysis of the local press and the letters of the MEMCh. The research results show that women organized themselves politically in a diversity of tendencies, linking themselves to the traditional parties, but also building their associations. Likewise, we observe that a sector of Mapuche women was organized preferentially in their own groups with demands associated with the processes of racialization, sometimes coming together with the demands of Chilean women, which would account for some tensions typical of the colonial experience they lived."

Although the results obtained were for Spanish given names, the method presented here can be easily replicated and used for names in other languages. Most methods reported in the literature use pre-existing lists of first names that require costly manual processing and tend to become quickly outdated. Instead, we propose using corpora. Doing so offers the possibility of obtaining real and up-to-date name-gender links. To test the effectiveness of our method, we explored various machine-learning methods as well as another method based on simple frequency of co-occurrence. The latter produced the best results: 93% precision and 88% recall on a database of ca. 10,000 mixed names. Our method can be applied to a variety of natural language processing tasks such as information extraction, machine translation, anaphora resolution or large-scale delivery or email correspondence, among others."

The relationship between citizenship, sustainable development, and willingness to act pro-environmentally is explored, elucidating how the latter might account for newer forms of citizenship and the role of educational systems in this process. Building upon these considerations and utilizing data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2016, the differences between countries in the willingness of eighth graders to act pro-environmentally in the future is analyzed and compared with various other participatory intentions. The chapter provides insights into the percentage of students willing to make efforts to sustain the environment when they become adults across all participating educational systems in ICCS 2016 and explores the relationship of this distribution with key country attributes, such as national richness and pollution indices."

However, its history has been marked by significant bureaucratic dysfunctions that cyclically call into question its global leadership. In this scoping literature review, we map 36 studies published in the last decade in WoS and Scopus databases to understand the distinctive and contradictory nature of UNESCO's global governance in the school education sector. We classified the studies according to their objectives and identified recurrent themes. The article reveals an interest in understanding UNESCO's governance at various institutional dimensions and topological scales. However, few studies focus on its influence in countries of the Global South, a space that also challenges the organization's global scripts. Likewise, the studies analyzed draw attention to the expressive weakening of UNESCO's humanistic orientation in favor of neoliberal visions. The article concludes with a preliminary assessment of UNESCO's governance, suggesting the need to investigate the role of its regional enclaves and the normative influence that the organization exerts at the level of school educational experience."

A normative policy instrument perspective | KEYWORDS: Chile; Educational policies; market system; policy trajectories; privatization | ABSTRACT: Chile is a paradigmatic case of market-oriented educational policies. This has led to a prolific research agenda aimed at understanding the trajectory and trends during the country’s dictatorial period and after the return to democracy. Generally, these studies have focused on comparing the main educational policies across different governments. In contrast, this article employs a normative policy instrument perspective to analyse the trajectory of Chilean educational policies from 1990 to 2022. The focus is on disentangling the inertia/change binomial in the implementation of educational policies, considering policy development within and between governments. Thus, the article seeks to understand when, how, and why subjects of educational policies, financial priorities, and ideological orientations change or persist over more than 30 years. The findings challenge the belief that educational policies are coherent and consistent within governments, identifying grey areas in each period. Additionally, the paper provides evidence of historical inertia in educational policies that transcends the ideologies of the governing parties. Finally, it is observed that changes in market-oriented educational policies have been more pronounced in the last decade, particularly during periods of political alternation between left- and right-wing governments."
461,19,"TITLE: Implementing Proximate Welfare Programs in Weak Institutional Contexts: Lessons From the Global South | KEYWORDS: activation programmes; frontline professionals; proximate welfare; weak state institutions | ABSTRACT: This article examines the implementation of proximity programmes in the Global South, particularly through Chile's Familias programme, to investigate the challenges faced by frontline professionals in weak institutional contexts. Drawing on interviews with Integral Family Supports implementing the programme, the study reveals that relational and spatial proximity are used to mitigate institutional weaknesses, compensating for the lack of available programmes and services. Whilst these proximate relationships provide families with emotional support, containment and motivation, they also temporarily reconfigure and heal State-citizen relations by humanising and bridging the public-private divide. However, these compensatory practises enable the programme to function despite deep structural deficiencies. In doing so, they risk obscuring institutional shortcomings whilst potentially reinforcing the very inequalities the programme aims to address. The study's findings offer valuable lessons for countries from the Global North undergoing welfare retrenchment and activation transformations, highlighting the potential risks of relying on proximate programme strategies in the absence of strong institutional support."

Analyzing the expansion and role of the EdTech sector in the Chilean educational system | KEYWORDS: Chile; Comparative education; Digital Governance; EdTech; Privatization | ABSTRACT: This article analyses the network of actors involved in the contemporary digitalization of the Chilean school system and the role of private EdTech corporations in this ecosystem. Using a framework based on new modes of education governance and contributions from the cultural political economy, three sources were triangulated: i) 22 semi structured interviews with key actors and policymakers, ii) a database of startups in the EdTech sector in Chile and iii) a systematization of the main digital education policies implemented in the country. The findings reveal a poorly coordinated network of actors, which has allowed the inorganic and heterogeneous growth of EdTech corporations, whose role encompasses not only the production of technology but also its articulation and management. To this form, EdTech companies play a central role not only as producers of technology, but also as articulators and administrators, illustrating a displacement of the State from some of its historic functions."

La Ley de Inclusión en Chile | KEYWORDS: education policy; education reform; Ideas; semiosis | ABSTRACT: The article explores the role of ideas and discourses that allowed the agenda-setting and enactment of the Inclusion Law in Chile in the year 2015, which can be conceived as a countercultural change in one of the most marketized educational systems worldwide. Based on the framework of discursive institutionalism, the investigation analyses sixteen interviews with key actors (ministers, academics, legislators, advisers) involved in the enactment of such policy, and the analysis of parliamentary acts and other official documents. The findings show that the debate of ideas that allowed the approval of the law included the mobilization of ideas such as the right to education and the end of the educational market, the generation of discursive strategies of persuasion about technical elements of the program and the generation of consensus on its implementation times, highlighting the importance of the processes of construction of common meanings in the implementation of complex educational laws."

Regímenes De Justificación En Las Universidades De Élite Chilenas | KEYWORDS: Chile; elites; Higher education; justification regimes | ABSTRACT: Few studies focus on understanding the role of universities in the elites’ legitimation processes. This article examines how elite universities-in the context of Chilean tertiary education massification-actively create privileged statuses. Focusing on eight case studies, we examine how these universities justify their roles and existence, generating distinctions that promote highly exclusive spaces, replicating elite privilege. Through 48 semi-structured interviews, this article focuses on understanding the justification arguments employed by faculty and deans from these elite institutions. Following Boltanski’s and Thévenot’s theoretical model, the results illustrate three different justification regimes: i) arguing for their elite status within the university system; ii) justifying the role they fulfil within Chilean society; and iii) defending their existence in the social structure. These regimes combine arguments relating to social justice, efficiency and market system performance in an eclectic and pragmatic way."
466,0,"TITLE: Are the school choices of indigenous students affected by discrimination? Evidence from Chile | KEYWORDS: ethnic discrimination; parents’ preferences; School choice; school segregation | ABSTRACT: A common criticisms of school choice programs is that, instead of improving student achievement, they would increase school segregation. Parents may use different criteria to choose a school, such as proximity, school quality, or the school's ethnic/racial composition. As a result, the system would be segregated based on the parent's preferences. This research examines the school preferences of indigenous parents and whether ethnic discrimination influences their decision-making process. Longitudinal national-level data from Chile were analyzed using OLS with fixed effects. The results show that indigenous students, particularly those who have suffered ethnic discrimination in middle school, prefer high schools with a higher percentage of indigenous students. Furthermore, it was found that the level of acts of discrimination occurring in middle schools increases as the percentage of indigenous students rises. However, when the proportion of indigenous and non-indigenous students is similar, indigenous students are less likely to face discrimination."

We rely on a structural feature of the school system: A considerable number of students who complete primary school must change schools to start their secondary education. Cardinality matching was performed to account for confounding variables. Sensitivity analysis was performed to address the fact that differences in unobserved variables could bias our findings. Results show that attending a school that groups students by ability causes a reduction in the average scores obtained in 10th grade of 0.07 SD for reading and 0.08 SD for mathematics. Students matched by their observed covariates could differ in their odds of attending a school with or without ability grouping by 15% for mathematics and 10% for reading, without altering our conclusions. Disadvantaged students are the most affected, whereas best-performing students do not benefit from this policy either."

Proposing a reflection based on the Antología del pensamiento crítico ecuatoriano contemporáneo (Anthology of contemporary Ecuadorian critical thought), edited by Gioconda Herrera (2018) and published by the Latin American Council of Social Sciences in the context of its fiftieth anniversary, this paper shows the marked link between critical thought in Ecuador and the institutional development of the social sciences. Important levels of academic professionalization are exhibited without implying a diminishing or limitation of the field’s transformative and contesting role. At the same time, analysis shows that, despite the pluralization of thought-with a corresponding diversification of the social actors of change and themes addressed-Ecuadorian critical thought has remained anchored to debates of concrete reality over time. Thus, contrary to what might be expected, politicization does not hinder the development of the social sciences, nor does professionalization depoliticize it."

This chapter aims to analyze the role of the spatial dimension in the trajectory of protests in the education sector during the Chilean post-dictatorship (1990-2019). Methodologically, the research carries out a Protest Event Analysis (PEA) of a novel database of more than 1.700 protests. The findings show that the spatial dimension (e.g., regional distribution, degree of rurality, types of places of protest, etc.) mediates not only the characteristics and the nature of actors who participate in protest events but also the strategies and repertoires of collective action deployed by social movements."

Based on a survey applied to more than 1.200 students from universities and careers traditionally associated with the economic, political, and cultural elites in Chile, this article analyzes their cultural tastes and practices to assess the validity and applicability of Bourdieu’s theses in this context. Employing both Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Latent Class Analysis, this paper identifies seven response profiles regarding the cultural taste, consumption and practices of students attending elite universities and careers. While some profiles follow the patterns of highbrow and lowbrow culture, others reveal more heterogeneous tastes and practices, questioning both omnivores and traditional Bourdieusians perspectives. Additionally, the results show that, while social class and school of origin are not related with these cultural profiles, gender, university, and career do. This leads to reevaluate the relative importance of familiar factors and the strong socializing role of elite educational contexts for cultural tastes and practices."

Two segregation indices, the dissimilarity index and the square root index, are used to meet these objectives. The results show high and persistent segregation for high socioeconomic status students, in contrast to the moderate and decreasing segregation levels seen in the low and middle socioeconomic groups. Besides, the decomposition exercise posits the universities as the focus of segregation in this system, where both the institution and the degree program constitute relevant factors in understanding the unequal distribution of high socioeconomic status students. These results invite an in-depth look at the mechanisms that hinder social integration in this area, with a particular emphasis on the segregation of the highest socioeconomic status students, whose place in this system promotes their academic and social differentiation."

Viejos y nuevos movimientos sociales en el campo educativo. Un análisis de la trayectoria de los marcos de acción colectiva en Chile (1990 - 2014) | KEYWORDS: Chile; collective action frames; educational field; protests; social movements | ABSTRACT: As a consequence of the neoliberal reforms initiated in the 1980s by the Pinochet dictatorship, education in Chile has become a highly controversial issue. Despite the extensive literature on social movements and education in Chile, there is still little evidence on the role of classic social movements and new social movements (NMS) in the educational field, and there is even less evidence on the evolution of the collective action frames of these actors over time. To contribute to this discussion, this article seeks to examine the trajectory of the discursive frameworks of collective action (diagnosis and prognosis) developed by different educational actors (teachers, university students and high school students) between 1990 and 2014. Methodologically, the article is based on a descriptive quantitative analysis of a database that follows the Protest Event Analysis (AEP) method, including 1,468 protest events. The results show the hybridization of the discursive tactics deployed in the protests by the classic social movements (teachers) and NMS (student movement) and the differences that exist concerning the protests' discursive frames over time of these groups. In this way, the article identifies convergences and divergences between actors and certain transversal changes over time, which allows discussing the potentialities and limitations of the theory of old and new social movements."

(2010). PISA 2009 Results: What Students Know and Can Do - Student Performance in Reading, Mathematics and Science (Vol. 1): OECD.). This trend has been accentuated in a global context of educational reforms aimed at improving academic performance through standards-based quality assurance systems (often built on the results of standardized national tests) and strengthening the links between productive development and the quality of education (ECLAC. (2010). La hora de la igualdad. Brechas por cerrar, caminos por abrir. Santiago: CEPAL.). The evidence gathered at the international level conclusively shows the direct negative short-, medium-, and long-term effects of school segregation on these objectives (Gorard and Fitz, Research Papers in Education 15:115-132, 2000; Harker, The effects of Student Composition on School Outcomes, Massey University, New Zealand.

This movement was a key actor in education reform debates in that period. Based on the perspective of political process theory, the article focuses on the contextual, organisational and discursive dynamics that define the Rosa Sensat movement, and its role as a sociopolitical actor in three historical periods: (i) the moment of emergence, linked to the dissident schools (1965–1970); (ii) the process of transition to democracy and educational decentralisation, marked by the difficulties in reforming public education (1970–1977); and (iii) the post-transition period, marked by the new constitution, the integration of dissident schools into the public system (1978–1990) and the marginalisation of the movement.

In terms of education policy as a whole, a process of reforms has been carried out in recent years that, not without difficulties and resistance (Bellei in RASE: Revista de la Asociación de Sociología de la Educación 9(2): 232-247, 2016), has sought to create institutional and organizational transformations in the education system that was implemented in the country in the early 1980s and which has remained largely untouched for more than 30 years (Bellei & Vanni in Education in South America, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2015; Falabella in Educação & Sociedade 36(132), 2015; Villalobos in Democracia versus neoliberalismo. 25 años de neoliberalismo en Chile.

To this end, we analyze eight highly prestigious and selective universities, focusing on three aspects: the evolution of the enrollment rate, the concentration of high socioeconomic status students on each institution, and the changes in the enrollment socioeconomic composition. The results show an expansion of the elite universities in the Región Metropolitana, which have concentrated a growing share of high socioeconomic status students. In addition, however, those universities that have developed deeper equity and inclusion initiatives have reached greater social heterogeneity levels, not so those that have not developed this kind of initiative and are geographically isolated. Finally, universities located outside the Región Metropolitana have been more socially diverse during this time."

MACROSOCIAL EXPLICATIVE FACTORS OF THE CHILEAN UNIVERSITY STUDENT MOVEMENT IN THE POST-DICTATORSHIP (1990-2019) PROTESTANDO EN LA CUNA DEL NEOLIBERALISMO. FACTORES EXPLICATIVOS MACROSOCIALES DEL MOVIMIENTO ESTUDIANTIL UNIVERSITARIO CHILENO EN LA POSTDICTADURA (1990-2019) | KEYWORDS: Latin America; Neoliberalism; Protest event analysis; Social movements; Student protest | ABSTRACT: The recent rise of social protest in Latin America has con-tradicted the hypotheses that predicted neoliberal reforms would weaken social movements in the region. In this re-spect, the Chilean student movement is paradigmatic both for its massiveness and for emerging in one of the coun-tries with the greatest neoliberal consolidation. Using a da-tabase that collects the university protests registered in 30 years (1990-2019), the article analyzes some factors that could explain the protest cycle. The results show that the level of public spending in higher education, the number of student aid education recipients, and the economic growth have relevant effects on the annual frequency of protests (although with different strengths). These findings illustrate how social and political pressures from new social groups constituted under the wing of neoliberal reforms exert an influence over protest cycles, in the context of an increase of expectations and demands."

It does this through three axes: the first is multidisciplinary, including historical, anthropological, sociological, and pedagogical, to account for varied aspects of the Chilean intercultural education. The second is the consideration of multiple indigenous peoples, analyzing students’ groups or indigenous peoples, such as the Rapa Nui, Aymara, or Mapuche. Finally, the book has a multilevel perspective that recognizes that educational policy involves different actors, from the central government to local communities. The book incorporates study material enriched with the experience and analysis of different perspectives and methodologies of its authors, being useful for understanding intercultural education in the country. It is a versatile resource for understanding this topic, as well as a support for the development of programs and policies."

Un Meta-Análisis de la Investigación sobre Política Educativa en el Chile Post-Dictadura (1990–2019) | KEYWORDS: Chile; educational policy; educational system; marketization; systematic review | ABSTRACT: Starting from the idea that research and who carry it out affect the construction of the educational system, this article seeks to describe and understand what the main patterns of academic publication on educational policy in post-dictatorship Chile (1990–2019) are. Through a systematic review of more than 300 articles about educational policy, the paper analyzes who publish, the methods used and what has been investigated during the last three decades. The results show that research on educational policy is characterized by being a masculinized and individualized space, dominated by elite universities and characterized for a disciplinary autonomy. In addition, research in educational policy is highly descriptive and tends to use a qualitative approach as a way of approaching the phenomena it studies. Finally, it is observed that, even though most of the studies have a critical stance towards the market, in general they seek to correct it rather than remove it. This exercise allows deepening the reflection on the reconfiguration of the relationship between research and educational policy, as well as the mechanisms of influence that educational researchers develop on educational policy."

Social workers have been key to addressing the multiple vulnerabilities the population has faced during the political uprising and pandemic. From a critical perspective that analyses precarity, precariousness and resistance as a continuum, this article examines SWs’ employment and intervention conditions during the pandemic and the resistances that have emerged in this context. Drawing upon a mixed sequential study that included an online survey (N ¼ 872) and forty-two semi-structured (online) interviews, we identified that precarity and precariousness affecting professional interventions have persisted. However, findings indicate that (i) younger and less educated frontline SWs were most affected by worsening employment conditions; (ii) the shift towards tele-intervention has not only led to transformations in professional roles but also in the emergence of new surveillance mechanisms and (iii) new types of professional resistances emerged that have been identified as individual and spontaneous but nevertheless explicit in nature. We conclude that the pandemic and the on-going political crisis present social work with an opportunity to advocate for dignified working conditions as well as changing the historical subordinate position of the profession."

In this regard, gaps in academic test scores are frequently perceived to be a fundamental transmission channel of socioeconomic segregation from secondary to postsecondary education. Within this framework, the purpose of this study is to analyze whether and to what degree socioeconomic segregation is reproduced in the transition from secondary to postsecondary education and how much of the socioeconomic segregation is related to academic segregation in the latter. Using a modified Dissimilarity Index to quantify the segregation of three Chilean cohorts, we find that, unlike in secondary education, academic performance is more decisive than socioeconomic background in the distribution of students in postsecondary education, with a notable reduction in the socioeconomic segregation levels in the transition to the latter. However, using a pioneering approach, we also find that less than half of the socioeconomic segregation in postsecondary education is related to academic sorting, suggesting that factors other than academic admission criteria are more relevant in explaining unequal distribution of students from different socioeconomic background in postsecondary education."

Based on an approach that stresses the agency of the actors in the process of social (re)production, we conducted six biographical interviews with members of the political- intellectual elite, alumni of Economics, Law, and Civil Engineering at the two most prestigious Chilean universities. The results show that these universities are configurated as spaces that allow subjects to activate knowledge and networks that are key to reach their current positions of political-intellectual decisions. This activation of privilege occurs through socially expectable educational trajectories, the development of relevant social relations, the openness to the social diversity that the university space provides, and the cosmopolitan experiences promoted in these elite universities. In this fashion, this paper contributes to the study of the university elite, emphasizing the agency of the actors in the process of social (re)production."
488,0,"TITLE: Elite universities in Chile: Between social mobility and reproduction of inequality | KEYWORDS: Chile; elite; reproduction of inequality; selection mechanisms; social diversity; social mobility; universities | ABSTRACT: The Chilean Higher Education System can be considered an exemplary case of massification based on the privatisation and heterogenisation of universities. These processes have created a dual system, with a large group of universities for mass education versus a small group of universities focused on educating elites. In this context, this paper aims to analyse the ethos and missions of elite universities and programmes, their selection mechanisms, and students' socioeconomic and cultural background. Eight case studies were selected, and different data collection techniques were used: interviews with academics, non-participant observations, students' survey and secondary data analysis. Results show that these elite universities (characterised by overrepresentation of students from the upper and middle-upper classes, high levels of excellence and prestige, and academic selection processes or high fees) respond to their own market niche's needs, differentiating themselves not only from 'mass universities' but also from each other. To achieve this, each elite university has its own vision, set of values and practices. Despite these differences, all the elite universities and programmes seek to face the current tertiary massification scenario by opening up to student social diversity ensuring, however, that these changes do not structurally modify their sociocultural composition or their institutional mission."

However, despite neoliberalism’s global reach, the scholarship on social work professional resistance has been largely limited to the Global North. Taking into consideration this absence in the literature, this article seeks to explore the possibilities for professional resistance in the Global South, specifically, in Chile, a country in which neoliberalism was forcefully imposed and that has experienced an exponential growth in social movements over the past two decades. The following article explores the structural and material conditions that have historically shaped social work resistances, arguing that the current social and political climate, specifically, the constitutional process under way, presents a space from which new resistances are possible and necessary in order to challenge neoliberal hegemony."

The study follows the comparative method to identify the convergences and divergences between the Alto al SIMCE movement in Chile, the teacher protest movement in Mexico, and the Green Tides movement in Spain. The results indicate that the adoption processes and the specific forms of test-based accountability policies can influence, condition, and constrain social movements’ protests and the possibilities for social change, underlining the interdependent relationship between action and social structure, which is key to explaining social a protest’s success or failure."

A survey was administered to 1,828 students enrolled in 11th and 12th grade. The results show that students share a multidimensional idea of excellence. Five dimensions are identified but, according to students’ perceptions, there were two constructs that stood out the most: “effort and self-improvement’” and ‘”social commitment and thoughtfulness.” We find that variables such as expectations about the future and perceptions about schools explain the dissimilar ideas of excellence shared by students. This research gives voice to students on a current topic of the educational agenda –the concept of excellence– and invites researchers to re-think this construct from perspectives other than academic achievements"

Based on a systematic review and a coding process of 260 papers, the study analyzes academic collaboration at three levels: countries, institutions, and researchers. In each level, the degree of centrality, betweenness, and closeness of each actor are calculated, in addition to the density of the network and the visualization through network maps. The results show that collaboration patterns are relatively low at all levels, although they show variations. Thus, while international collaboration networks focus on countries from the Global North, showing low levels of collaboration with Latin America countries, in the case of institutions, collaboration tends to focus on those with greater prestige and tradition, although including increasingly broad and differentiated clusters. Finally, academic collaborations at the level of researchers present low density and a scarcity of connections, although the existence of key actors."

It employs the methodology of sociological portraits. The results show that while these youngsters regard their entrance into an elite university as a meritorious achievement, they face, in turn, strong pressures from their families, a constant anguish about being socially maladapted to the ambit of an elite university and expectations that they will wholly devote themselves to their studies, at the sacrifice of the normal leisure activities and social life of youngsters of their age."
494,7,"TITLE: Front-Line Social Workers’ Practices Under the Political and Sanitary Crisis in Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Front-line professionals; Mixed methods; Neoliberalism; Precarious employment conditions; Social programs | ABSTRACT: In October 2019, mass civil protests erupted in Chile questioning the country’s vast and historically rooted inequalities and injustices. These protests, which sought structural changes to Chile’s neoliberal ethos, were abruptly brought to a halt by the arrival of COVID-19 in March 2020. The political, social, and economic impacts of the pandemic have only intensified the country’s historic inequalities and injustices, hitting hardest in areas with higher levels of vulnerability. Increased unemployment, food insecurity, violence, and mental health crises are only a few of the many issues social workers face in the current context. Furthermore, social distancing measures and forced quarantines have caused social programs to rapidly alter strategies to meet the needs of service users, requiring front-line professionals to adapt quickly. To examine and analyse these rapid changes in the delivery of social programs as well as their impact on front-line professionals, a mixed-methods study was undertaken that included the application of an online survey and follow-up interviews with front-line social workers. We found that social workers reported greater workloads and employment precarity within the current context, that programs were changed to meet the immediate tangible needs of individuals and families, and that changes were primarily designed in a nonparticipatory and centralised manner. This chapter analyses the study’s results and discusses the challenges social work faces in the current and future context."

In this context, a growing number of studies has pointed out that the experience of learning at home is an essential factor influencing their subjective well-being, raising the importance of parental involvement in the educational process of their children. This article explores the formal and informal parental practices of home learning during school closures period in 19 countries and their explanatory factors, with the further aim of discussing their implications for children’s subjective well-being. The study uses the International COVID-19 Impact on Parental Engagement Study (ICIPES) database and develops a regression analysis of family, child, and school factors predicting parental involvement in homeschooling. The main findings show that parents’ socioeconomic status is a critical predictor of both formal and informal parental practices. In addition, the results denote the impact of other factors, such as the level of parental confidence with the use of technology and children’s age and gender (in the case of informal activities). Based on these findings, the article discusses policy implications to promote parental involvement and children’s subjective well-being."

This article seeks to map the elites in the Chilean university field, identifying the main undergraduates programmes and universities where this group is concentrated and, furthermore, typifying how these institutions promote (or not) processes of mobility and reproduction of the elites. Through a diversified statistical analysis, it is concluded that the academic and social elites are mainly concentrated in two select groups: a few traditional institutions, with high prestige and a high level of selectivity; and in new institutions, privates and focused on capturing the country's social high class. Additionally, the results show that the Chilean education system promotes low levels of social mobility of the elite, structured in a system that allows to perpetuate the reproduction processes of this group."

The massive students’ public demonstrations in Chile in the last ten years and the low rate of young voters’ turnout in elections have raised the question about young people’s preparation to participate as citizens in society. The results show that students’ civic and political background has the greatest influence in political participation, while the influence of school is mainly related to school governance and teacher practices. This discussion focused on the challenges that these results could mean for schools in Chile."

The sample was composed of 528 seventh to ninth graders (Mage = 15; 64.1% girls)from 12 classrooms (four in each category of ability grouping)across two waves in five schools in Chile. The effects of academic performance and school misconduct on receiving academic and friendship nominations were examined, as well as the interplay between academic and friendship relationships. Furthermore, the extent to which similarity in adolescents' academic performance and school misconduct contributed to the formation and maintenance of academic and friendship relationships was examined. Sex, socioeconomic status, and structural network features were also taken into account. Longitudinal social network analyses (RSiena)indicated that (1)in high-ability classrooms students chose high-achieving peers as academic partners; (2)in high-ability classrooms students avoided deviant peers (i.e., those high in school misconduct)as academic partners; and (3)academic relationships led to friendships, and vice versa, in both high- and low-ability classrooms. Whereas the interplay of friendship and academic relationships was similar in high- and low-ability classrooms, the formation and maintenance of academic networks unfolded differently in these two types of classrooms."

In order to contribute to this gap in knowledge, this study sought to identify the individual, family and programme variables associated with not meeting conditionalities of Chile’s CCT.The study found that certain variables related to family vulnerability were associated with not meeting conditionalities. These findings uncover an important contradiction in Chile’s CCT programme, since while seeking to guarantee social inclusion the programme may in fact be contributing to greater exclusion."

To this end, a systematic review of the scientific production published on the Chilean student movement is made. This movement is one of the most relevant in Chile's recent history. 149 publications were systematized, published between 2000 and 2016. The results show that the capacity of the Chilean social sciences to deal with these contradictory demands is partial, since their critical analyzes tend to be uniforms and limited in time, while their empirical studies do not always have the levels of internationalization and complexity currently demanded in international publishing circuits."

Since their boom in the 1990s newer modalities have emerged, incorporating some innovative components. The following study sought to examine one particular CCT program heralded as innovative due to its psychosocial and socio employment accompaniment components: Chile's Ethical Family Wage program. Utilizing administrative data from the Ministry of Social Development this exploratory study sought to examine family trajectories in the program with a particular focus on those families who were terminated from the program due to not meeting conditionalities. Findings from the study indicate that the program deviates sharply from its theoretical implementation. Furthermore, the probabilities of program termination increased in those families headed by younger adults, female and single-headed households, households with higher levels of education as well as larger families. However, a greater number of children decreased the probabilities of program termination as was homeownership. Implications of the findings for policy and practice are discussed."

From a comparative perspective, these may be analyzed to provide the distribution, concentration and spread of immigrant students among schools and countries. Here three methods of analysis were employed: (1) descriptive analysis, (2) construction of segregation indices, and (3) multilevel analysis. In general, countries do not implement systematic policies to concentrate or segregate immigrant students, although there are important differences between countries; instead there is a need to appreciate strong relationships between levels of segregation and inequality or human development indexes, and consider geographical, cultural and economic factors. Schools appear to have a limited effect in transforming attitudes toward immigration."

However, the debate regarding the actual capacity of schools to fulfill this task, set against the role of families and individual preferences, is still open. To analyze how the characteristics of schools may shape student attitudes toward diversity in terms of gender, immigration and ethnic groups, a multilevel model that takes into consideration the characteristics of the school, such as the composition of diversity, school climate and teacher practices, and individual characteristics, such as socioeconomic background and civic interest, was used. Schools seem to have a limited leverage in promoting attitudes toward diversity, due to the fact that variance in attitudes occurs mainly within schools. The main findings are discussed in terms of research, policy and practice."

Through quantitative analysis, three types of grouping are identified: a) at the beginning of the school year, b) the reorganization of students, and c) the non-random distribution of new students. The results suggest that grouping by ability is the most frequent during the final years of compulsory education, especially in the first and third years of secondary school or in the final years of secondary school. Grouping by ability is the most frequent at schools with the greatest vulnerability and size."

It uses data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study. The results show that in Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, teacher practices and attitudes relate to the civic outcomes. Although teachers' practices and attitudes significantly predict students' civic knowledge, this relationship does not seem relevant for students' expected participation and students' attitudes toward diversity. Still, the democratic environment of the school is a relevant variable in the case of expected participation of students and their attitudes toward diversity, which shows a possible indirect influence of teachers through the school environment. The results are discussed in relation to the civic education curriculum in place in the countries analyzed."

In this context, the paper analyzes four different programs from Bolivia (Intercultural Community Indigenous Universities), Brazil (Quotas´ Law), Chile (Follow up and Effective Access to Higher Education Program) and Ecuador (Scholarship Program based on Quotas) aimed at improving the participation of marginalized students in the university from three different perspectives. First, conceptually, the paper analyzes the governance of these programs in terms of what are the institutional arrangements that define who is responsible for solving this source of inequality in higher education. Second, the study looks at the concepts of equality, fairness, merit, need and diversity behind the different initiatives presented, using the social justice debate. Thirdly, the paper uses the framework of analysis of different types of access programs to study the scope, components and arrangements of the policies. The results show a high level of heterogeneity in the characteristics and focuses of the programs, which allows to deepen the discussion on the role of access to higher education in the region."

To do this, first we review the discourses and practices that have developed in Portugal to promote the commercialization, competitiveness and accountability. Subsequently, we describe the implementation process and main consequences of the Chilean case, as privatization of the system, the increase of socioeconomic and academic segregation, a limitation of freedom of choice and the reduction in the role of education which this model has generated in more than 30 years of application. Considering this, in the last section the similarities and differences between the two countries and processes are discussed, showing the existence of discursive points of convergence but structural differences in the way of implementation of these policies, allowing some elements to deliver promotion a-grounded, broad and democratic debate on the role and significance of education in Portugal."

Composición de género en establecimientos escolares chilenos: ¿Afecta el rendimiento académico y el ambiente escolar? | KEYWORDS: Co-education schools; Gender composition; School effectiveness; Single-sex schools | ABSTRACT: This study analyzes the differences in academic achievement and school environment of a special feature of school composition: the gender of the students. Regarding the discussion about efficiency and effectiveness in co-educational and single-sex schools in the USA and Europe, this paper examines the effects on academic and social outcomes of schools with different gender composition in Chile. To analyze net differences of gender composition, a Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method was used. The results show no statistical differences in academic achievement and school environment between co-education and single-sex schools in different grades (4th, 8th in primary and 10th in secondary), although we found statistical differences in some grades in academic self-esteem in favor of single-sex schools. This evidence suggests new challenges to the national educational policy and future research in this area."

The article shows how this system is organized from the resignation of the role of the state in education, the centrality of private schools, the implementation of demand subsidies and the implementation of strong accountability, which has enhanced and deepened educational segregation, reducing the freedom of choice and generating social mobilization in the country, producing marked changes in the structures, processes and educational outcomes. Against this reality, we discuss the necessity and possibility of building a new educational logic, based on reflectivity, development of critical thinking, intelligent accountability and integral education."

The principle of deference brings with it the idea of restricting the work of the courts in the analysis of the constitutionality of the norms. In this work, the origin concept and foundations of this principle will be analyzed, in addition to considering that it should be attenuated when, in the analysis, it collides with human rights, giving them primacy even over democratic decisions."

In light of this novel context, the present work aims to propose recommendations for the New Constitution to regulate the incorporation of international human rights law based on a model of interaction with domestic law. For this purpose, it is necessary to study the current situation of the incorporation of international norms into Chilean law, reviewing the current constitutional regulation and the application of such norms in different judicial venues. To achieve this objective, we will resort to a descriptive and prescriptive dogmatic methodology, since we will analyze the current problem and propose solutions that allow progress in the protection of the person, along the lines of a transformative constitutionalism. We will also apply a comparative methodology, analyzing how other legal systems deal with this problem. According to our conclusions, the Constitution currently omits to expressly regulate the hierarchy of international human rights law, existing different doctrinal and jurisprudential positions in this regard. Thus, while the Constitutional Court maintains an infra-constitutional hierarchy, the ordinary courts defend the constitutionality block. To overcome this complex situation, it is necessary for the New Constitution to include provisions that grant greater recognition to the process of incorporating the sources of international human rights law, establishing the principles of conforming interpretation and pro homine. Finally, it is necessary that the regulation of powers and procedures on the incorporation of such sources reason with a logic of interaction between international law and domestic law."

This study aimed 1) to test the effects of 6 weeks of concurrent exercise including high-intensity interval plus resistance training (CTHIIT+RT) on the arterial stiffness condition of individuals with different blood pressure controls, and 2) to compare the magnitude of exercise adaptations among different blood pressures and vascular characteristics. An experimental clinical randomized study was conducted in six categories (three controls and three experimental groups) of adults who were divided into six groups: control hypertensive (CG-HTN, n=10), control elevated blood pressure (CG-ELE, n=10), control normotensive (CG-NT, n=10), experimental hypertensive (ExG-HTN, n=10), elevated blood pressure (ExG-ELE, n=10), or normotensive (ExG-NT, n=10). The participants underwent 6 weeks of concurrent training with 5 min of high-intensity interval plus 5 min of resistance training (CTHIIT+RT), where systolic pulse wave velocity of the brachial artery (PWVba) (primary outcome) and additional secondary blood pressure, body composition, and vascular outcomes were measured before and after 6 weeks of intervention. After 6 weeks of CTHIIT+RT, significant reductions in ΔPWVba were reported in ExG-HTN vs. ExG-NT (diff. 0.86 m/s-1) and between ExG-ELE and ExG-NT (diff. 0.76 m/s-1). In conclusion, 6 weeks of CTHIIT+RT reduced arterial stiffness in adults with different blood pressure controls, but with a superior magnitude in HTN patients. Additional benefits include remission of high blood pressure in patients with hypertension."

This study aimed 1) to describe and compare the HR during exercise between HTN and normotensive adults and 2) to describe the endothelial function and related vascular parameters in both groups. A descriptive clinical study was conducted with 64 adults (men and women) who were divided into three groups: arterial hypertension (HTN n=26), elevated blood pressure (Ele n=16), or normotensive control (CG n=22). The participants underwent an incremental cycling exercise test of 5 stages, where HR (primary outcome) was measured, and secondary vascular outcomes (percentile classification of the pulse wave velocity (%ILEPWVba), maximum carotid intima-media thickness (cIMTmax), and arterial age among others were measured. In stage 2 of the test (50-100 watts), the HTN group showed significantly higher HR vs. CG (+14 beats/min; p<0.05) and vs. Ele group (+15 beats/min; p<0.05), and in stage 5 (125-250 watts), HTN group showed higher HR vs. CG (+22 beats/min; p<0.05). HTN group showed a higher arterial stiffness by %ILEPWVba classification and arterial age estimation than the CG group. In conclusion, HTN patients reported a higher HR response only in two out of five (monitored) stages of the Astrand cycling exercise test than normotensive peers. Moreover, all groups showed a higher HRpredicted than real HRpeak obtained from the exercise test. These results are displayed with more altered vascular parameters in the HTN group."

We evaluated: number of published articles; the number of publications divided by the number of people in science and technology (number pub/number peo); the top incidence of research subjects; public or private institution al predominance; impact factor (IF); average citations per document per country; and frequency of published articles per journals per country. Brazil showed the highest number of published articles, followed by Argentina. Bolivia showed the highest number pub/number peo, followed by Peru. Most studied themes were physiology, orthopedic and rehabilitation. Public institutions showed a higher published articles number than did private institutions. Peru and Bolivia were the only countries with a mean IF of 2 or higher. Average citation was higher in Peru (higher coefficient variation). In conclusions, our results show that, in most South American countries, their published articles rate has increased over time. This could be related to new government and institutional policies. However, production was low compared with other areas of science."

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, resistin, and adiponectin are known cytokines that are sensitive to physical inactivity and exercise, however, their acute behaviour after one session of exercise in physically inactive young adults is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a session of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on the circulatory levels of FGF21, resistin, and adiponectin of physically inactive young adults. Material and methods: quasi-experimental study, where 20 physically inactive young adults, with body mass indexes between 18 and 30 kg/m2 were included. All performed one MICT session, with an intensity of 60% of their heart rate reserve on a treadmill for 30 minutes. Anthropometric measurements were evaluated (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, lean and fat mass) prior to exercise, and venous blood samples were taken before and after exercise, where glycemia, insulin, lipid profiles, transaminases, FGF21, resistin, and adiponectin were assessed. Results: one MICT session decreased the circulatory levels of insulin (median 23.5 vs 10.9 µUI/ml; p<0.05) and FGF21 (median 527 vs 409 pg/ml; p<0.05). On the other hand, resistin and adiponectin levels did not change after exercise (both p>0.05). Conclusion: one MICT session decreased FGF21 plasma levels, whereas it did not modify resistin and adiponectin circulatory levels. The specific mechanisms behind this different behavior are needed to be elucidated in future studies."

Myostatin (Mstn) and follistatin (Fs) are two key regulators of muscle mass, which are known to be dysregulated in people with hyperglycaemia. Exercise is frequently prescribed to counteract these changes; however, the influence of exercise intensity is unknown.The purpose of this study was to compare two training programs, moderate-intensity constant (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT), on soleus mRNA levels of Mstn and Fs in an animal model of hyperglycaemia. Material and Methods: 36 maleWistar rats, were divided into control (n=18) and hyperglycaemic (HG, n=18; induced by a single intraperitoneal dose of Streptozotocin) groups. Subsequently, these groups were randomly subdivided into control untrained,control+moderate-intensity constant training (MICT), control+high-intensity interval training (HIIT),HG untrained,HG+MICT, and HG+HIIT (n=6 each subgroup).Training programs were performed for 8 weeks, with a frequency of 5 sessions per week.The total distance covered per session in MICT and HIIT was equal. 48 hours following the last training session, rats were anesthetized and soleusmuscles were excised. Results: HIIT reduced and increased significantly the Mstn and Fs mRNA levels respectively, irrespective of hyperglycaemia (p<0.05).When Mstn:Fs ratio was analysed, only HIIT induced a significant increase in hyperglycaemic rats (p<0.05). Conclusion: HIIT over MICT, changed the Mstn and Fs soleus mRNA levels, irrespective of hyperglycaemia.This could indicate that the regulation of these genes is exercise intensity-dependent, whereas hyperglycaemia seems to not blunt this response."

Una aproximación desde la publicidad | KEYWORDS: Advertising; Dictatorship; Magazines; Semiotic; Women | ABSTRACT: The objective of this article is to analyze advertising directed at women in the context of the dictatorship in Chile (1973-1990). In retrospect, advertising constitutes a valuable testimonial resource and is an eloquent expression of the transformations that Chile underwent during the authoritarian regime before neoliberalism expanded to other regions. Using a mixed methodology that combined content analysis and semiotics, the results reveal a modernizing emphasis within the female consumer imaginary, associated with the values of the imposed neoliberal order that positioned consumption as one of the main drivers of social relations. However, this proposal did not significantly alter the roles that advertising has traditionally assigned to women. The conclusion drawn is that advertising reflects both the modernizing dynamics of the time as well as the contradictions and conflicts inherent in the stereotypical representation of women in the media."

Under a semiotic approach, we identified different dimensions present in forging women's consumption imaginary in three periods: 1952, 1970 and 2010. A corpus of six advertisements aimed at women in three different periods was selected and analyzed. Among the results, we noted that the representation of women was circumscribed to two main dimensions: physical beauty as something desirable and a social validation requirement, and self-fulfillment in the household setting, which is in tune with female stereotypes widely disseminated in the media. However, there are also features of such representations that implicitly question it, illustrating how more complex female portrayals in advertising might be."

The objective was to assess how advertising -and specifically its graphics- contributed to the creation of a female imaginary as well as its ability to represent cultural changes. Using semiotics as the analytic tool, we were able to identify typological and stereotypical patterns of the female consumer. We concluded that the relationship between representation and consumption is a complex milieu for negotiation and expansion of women traditional roles."

Built on the ex San Luis Estate between 1979 and 1982, Parque Arauco Shopping Center was promoted as an accomplished promise of the economic progress brought by a new government, and as a model for a suburban lifestyle inspired by mass consumption and motorization. Parque Arauco's significance in urban history holds relation with the discursive articulation of its imaginaries about modernity, its polemic installation in ideologically polarized times, and its localization in a site that was loaded with previous projects. The installment process of Parque Arauco can be studied as a symbolic act, which proclaimed and materialized the ideological turn in a city that is now defined by consumption as a productive force of urban space."

Therefore, in this paper we propose an alternative approach trying to fix the relationship among transformation of commercial areas in Santiago de Chile between 1990 and 2010, as well as real estate restructuring dynamics. Hence, it was found that by means of shapes, functions and structures of several commercial areas-galleries, passages, protomalls and malls, as the consumption activity is key to comprehend the dynamics of metropolization and renewal of the city central areas. That is why a bust to certain buildings like malls are framed in very identified urbanization strategies, which imply both the promotion of certain values and alternative reoccupation by different social groups."

However, despite the social value assigned to it, international evidence indicates that the social status of students’ families continues to prevent significant mobility in the social structure. In Chile, despite policies to increase access to higher education, the university system continues to reproduce inequalities of origin through selection, separating elite students from low-income students. In this context, little is known about the perception that university students have of the role that these institutions play in social mobility, especially for those of more disadvantaged social origins. This article explores and describes the persistence of the university dream among Chilean’s students at the Catholic University of Temuco, the Chilean educational institution with the highest percentage of poor students in the country, analyzing it on the understanding that aspirations represent idealist targets of the desired social class, while expectations represent realistic goals regarding the expected social class. Based on a statistical analysis of survey data from 209 students, results show that students’ family origin does not prevent them from projecting themselves as part of a higher class, with the university acting as an agent that dynamizes positions to favor greater homogeneity in the future social structure. In addition, postgraduate degrees are defined as a catalyst for future social mobility. Finally, the future tensions between the still-hegemonic meritocratic discourse and the reality of the social space that these students will occupy are discussed."

Due to the limited housing options the State provides, these settlements have historically developed forms of organization and struggle in search of their right to the city. Essentially, these actions focus on self-management to obtain a place to live. However, despite sharing similar needs, these groups show diverse forms of struggle. In the current context, with a growing demand for housing in the country, various strategies these groups adopt to integrate into the city can be observed. This article focuses on analyzing the occupation and spatial governance strategies implemented in two encampments located in the city of Temuco, Chile: Los Pinos and Los Ripieros, through a qualitative approach based on the application of a social mapping to the leaders of both settlements and the exploration of narratives related to past and future spatial governance. Differences were identified between these two encampments. Although they share a contiguous physical location and emerged at the same time, the results reveal that, despite initial similarities in urban development, there are differences in the motivations guiding their future actions. While Los Ripieros actively seeks to influence obtaining a permanent housing solution in other sectors of the city, Los Pinos chooses to get involved within the framework of existing urban regulations to secure a housing solution in the same place. These findings enrich the discussion on urban marginality by showing that the struggles for space of excluded groups are centered on the balance between rootedness and obtaining housing. The latter is vital for the state to consider when designing urban policies."
534,6,"TITLE: Spatial preferences and counterurbanization in Temuco, Chile: between the pleasure of the natural and residential anonymity | KEYWORDS: Habitus; natural amenity; social class; spatial preferences | ABSTRACT: Counterurbanization tends to be associated with the mid-upper and upper classes moving from cities to rural areas. However, the persistent desire for housing, the permeation of the neoliberal model throughout all society based on the principle of universal consumption, and the exhaustion many people feel with urban life, have ended up relativizing the traditional correspondence between social class, capital, and habitus. This paper describes the narratives of projective spatial preferences in rural areas among different social classes in Temuco, one of the most important cities in Chile. After analyzing 30 interviews, the results point to a spatial preference for the rural areas of the city in all social classes, which in turn is sustained in the value placed on the social isolation that suburban areas offered, a feature that is appreciated even more than the natural amenities provided by these places."

However, this way of problematizing social inequalities hides three disadvantages: first, it is assumed that important social differences are marked by the possession of material goods, which is why this type of variable is the most widely used to study spatial inequalities; secondly, it ignores the debate on the mechanisms of social value that the occupation performed in the labor market has for the attribution of social, material, and symbolic well-being in contemporary societies; and, finally, the analysis of other dimensions that condition inequality, such as ethnic and national origin, is not contemplated relationally. Considering the models that observe social class systems, this paper aims to analyze the socio-spatial stratification dynamics of two Chilean conurbations during the period 2002-2017: Iquique-Alto Hospicio and Temuco-Padre Las Casas. Based on a social class indicator and its statistical relationship with ethnic and national origin, the socio-spatial structure of both spaces is described. The results indicate that, although in both conurbations ethnic and national origin is related to the class condition of a given space, in Temuco and Padre Las Casas this is more severe. These results open the debate regarding social tensions in Chilean cities."

Faced with the impossibility of obtaining housing through subsidies, informal settlements—camps and land grabs—have expanded through the country's different cities since 2019. Given the evident collision with the Sustainable Development Goals (in particular Goal 11) commitments to sustainable cities, the Chilean State has increased its housing budget since 2020 to reactivate investment during the COVID-19 pandemic and expand the housing access alternatives for lower-class families with few possibilities chances of obtaining a bank mortgage. But is it possible to choose housing in contexts like the one described? In addition to environmental difficulties, cities in northern Chile, wedged between the sea and the desert, need to produce a socially sustainable environment in accordance with the requirements of complex, dynamic systems under permanent pressure to generate wellbeing. This manuscript seeks to explore and analyze these tensions in the cities of Iquique and Alto Hospicio, in Chile's Tarapacá Region. They form a dynamic conurbation, where daily mobility and the dispute over access to housing clash with the choice offered by the different subsidy programs and the expansion of camps on the edges of the desert. So, how far or how close is SDG 11 in places like these? Is there a viable alternative for urban sustainability in precarious spaces?"
537,6,"TITLE: Residential Expectations in a Neoliberal Perspective: A Sociological View of Social Classes and the Right to Housing | KEYWORDS: Class identity; Habitus; Middle city; Residential taste; Socio-spatial structure | ABSTRACT: The neoliberal system not only implies the establishment of a model based on the role the market plays in society at the expense of the state, but also a paradigm that impacts people’s livelihoods. Due to this, the social class structure currently includes a significant number of middle classes and a far smaller segment of workers’ groups. Regarding livelihoods, the neoliberal system conditions the ways of conceiving and reproducing consumption of various material and symbolic goods, including the residential area for living. What happens when you want to live in certain areas of the city but the economic capital available is not enough to fulfill that desire? In other words, what mechanisms to different social classes use to adapt their residential desires to their objective position in the social system (class position)? This chapter describes the expectations and mechanisms of residential adaptation of people from different social classes in Temuco and Padre Las Casas, one of Chile’s largest conurbations with the highest population growth in recent decades. For this, following the assumptions of grounded theory, 60 semi-structured interviews of people from different social classes in these cities were conducted and analyzed. The residential expectations analyzed express different needs according to social class."
538,6,"TITLE: The end of indigenous territory? Projected counterurbanization in rural Protected Indigenous Areas in Temuco, Chile | KEYWORDS: Amenities; Leisure plots; Lifestyle; Logistic regression; Mapuche communities | ABSTRACT: Indigenous land is permeable to uses and practices that differ greatly from what current regulations establish. At the international level it is possible to see how real estate, agribusiness and forestry projects are diminishing these communities' capacity to control and manage their territories. A similar situation can be seen in Chile, where Mapuche communities have experienced a loss of territory to these external productive agents. However, a new actor has appeared on the horizon of permeability of indigenous territory: the amenity migrant. In this sense, and less evidently in the international literature, the counterurbanization process based on amenity uses in legally protected indigenous lands opens up a new front in the conflicts over peri-urban lands. The objective of this paper is to explore and discover the future impacts that the processes of suburbanization through counterurbanization will have indigenous lands in the vicinity of the city of Temuco, regional capital of La Araucanía (Chile), which are already visible. Considering a series of variables theoretically related to the projection of natural amenity on rural land and applying a logistic regression model, the results indicate that the future of the Títulos de Merced, the main mechanism recognizing property over indigenous lands, will be affected by the expansion of leisure plots, the modality through which amenity practices in Chile are disseminated. With this evidence, the implications that this situation has for Territorial Planning Instruments are discussed."

These groups, motivated by spatial preferences, transform urban spaces. This paper explores the spatial transformations of classes in the city of Temuco (Chile) between 1992 and 2002. Leaving aside the traditional indicators of residential segregation and overcoming deterritorialization in social stratification models, important changes are observed in the city. Among them, a peri-urban encounter between very different classes, former worker zones that rise in the socio-spatial scale, and the spatial diversification of the ascending middle class. D.R."

The symbolic devices linked to the idea of housing are analyzed, thereby determining the discursive differences between upper, middle and lower classes. Considering the changes in the forms of production of current capitalism, the creation of new social classes and the early introduction of the idea of own housing in Chile, the assumption raised by Bourdieu, regarding the degree of correspondence between the capitals of a person and the projection of a particular spatial taste on the city, is relativized. Recognizing five different sectors of Temuco in socio-spatial terms and using the Grounded Theory as a methodological strategy to analyze 30 interviews conducted, the results indicate that the principle of property over housing operates as the central foundation of residential expectation, independent of class social of the person."

The logics under which the real estate market and other different agents operate, together with the flexibility of urban planning instruments that regulate the territory, means urban space environments are permanently changing. Temuco, one of the most important intermediate cities in Chile in terms of population numbers, operates under the same logics. However, unlike other Chilean cities, the presence of Indigenous Territory Protection Areas (APTI) associated with Mapuche communities, establishes legal barriers that impede the conventional growth of the city. Likewise, it is possible to see how in recent decades these lands have been permeable to different uses, outside the dimensions supposedly protected by law. This work explores the discourses of Mapuche peri-urban landowners regarding the changes that these areas have recently undergone as a result of the city's expansion. To do this, 20 interviews were conducted with Mapuche landowners from peri-urban areas around Labranza, an urban area of Temuco, which were analyzed under the parameters of the Grounded Theory. Among the results obtained, the following stand out: Pressure strategies on this land from different private agents, the loss of ancestral sense of the land by some Mapuche communities that end up selling under different legal loopholes, and the resistance to external interference that still persists in many of them. The latter shows that there are Mapuche resistance strategies not only in territories affected by forestry intervention, but also in those spaces under stress from the rapid growth of cities."

For the success in this occupation there was an active policy of encouragement of the arrival of a civilizing agent, personify in the European habitant. This agent, together with Chilean colonists, arrived to Temuco, a city that will become soon the center of the new geography of power in Araucanía. This work aims to analyze the commercial dynamics of an incipient commercial elite formed by foreign and Chilean colonists in the early years of Temuco (1885-1913). Considering commercial records, city plans and chronicles of the time, differences by nationality are observed in the type of commercial activity and occupied space, as well strategies of economic, social and institutional diversification that transform the germans into the potential local elite of the city."

Using the model of Erikson and Goldthorpe (1992), the location of Mapuche and non-Mapuche people from different social classes is described. The results indicate that Mapuche and non-Mapuche individuals share spaces when both belong to qualified manual classes, while they differ spatially when individuals take part in non-manual and non-qualified classes. The results are important to observe the processes of socio-spatial fragmentation in intercultural cities."

An expression of urban change is the emergence of gated communities. This article presents the localization patterns of vertical and horizontal gated communities in the city of Temuco (Chile) between 2005 and 2014. Processing information from the Directorate of Public Works of the city, and considering the constructions under law co-ownership, it is possible to observe the forms of implementation of these urbanizations. Georeferencing these projects, the results indicate that condominiums houses are especially concentrated in peri-urban areas of the south-west of the city, while the edifices in two districts of the center, one of the foundational area of the city, and the other a recent commercial space consolidation. These results are important to observe the reproduction of socio-spatial inequality and possible gentrification in the city center."

Despite a rich theoretical debate in the literature on social stratification, there is a shortage of empirical approaches to this phenomenon in Latin America. This research note seeks to bridge the analytical gap by describing the social exclusion of indigenous people in Chile. From a case study in La Araucanía region and using statistical techniques to give equal weightings to indigenous and non-indigenous groups (specifically Mapuches and non-Mapuches), we attempt to show that given equal socio-demographic conditions, the incomes of both groups are similar in the low and middle strata, and differentiated in the higher strata."

This, together with collective labor and the presence of human interments underneath the floors of the enclosures, could account for a settlement pattern with stable residential camps. We discuss this by considering archaeological data from other sites of the Late Archaic Period on the coastal desert (6500-4000 cal. BP).

The attributes analyzed include the sites' formal characteristics and their role as territorial inscriptions and social containers, their materials and internal organization, and the associated social practices and the role of these public spaces in everyday experience and social order. We emphasize the variability, both in formal terms and with respect to the associated actions and usage of these open, constructed spaces and their shared use, and consequently, the differences in the congregational and public actions. We propose a frame of analysis that broadens the use of architecture as a historic-cultural indicator, integrating models from related fields."
548,3,"TITLE: Estimation of stops of last-mile delivery vehicles: An application in the food industry in the city of Santiago de Chile | KEYWORDS: Disaggregated data; Freight transport; GPS; Vehicle stops | ABSTRACT: The study of vehicle stops in last-mile delivery has gained ground in the specialized logistics literature. An efficient last-mile delivery reduces distribution costs and mitigates negative externalities such as pollution and congestion. This paper estimates the stops of last-mile trucks that deliver food products in Santiago, Chile. The aim is to study last-mile delivery operations using a non-intrusive, low-cost method. Particularly, we devise a novel methodology that employs multiple data sources to detect the primary stops of cargo vehicles. The proposed methodology involves the following two steps. First, we use GPS data to identify all the candidates for stops, that is, clusters of points close to each other in terms of distance and time, and then, these stops are classified as primary according to the proximity to planned visits or check-out markings. Finally, we conduct a case study involving food distribution, deriving managerial and public policy insights. We find that the most adequate time threshold to detect stops in our context is 4 min, which is considerably lower than previous studies. This last may be explained by the last-mile nature of our study. Our results show that primary (i.e., delivery) stops are concentrated mainly in the center of Santiago, with a duration that decreases as the hours go by. This last means that some of the externalities caused by truck stops (e.g., road capacity reduction) are exacerbated during the morning rush hour. We also find that the average duration of the primary stops is 12.5 min, while the mean distance traveled between two consecutive stops is 4.68 km."
549,5,"TITLE: The impact of lockdown, fatigue, and social interaction on highway demand during the COVID-19 pandemic: The case of Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; Highway; Panel data models; Private transportation | ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the government measures to curb its spread, have significantly affected mobility. Various studies have investigated behavioral changes across different transport modes accounting for sociodemographic variables, yet the focus has predominantly been on public transportation. This article addresses this gap by quantifying the impact of mobility restrictions on an urban highway in Santiago, Chile. To do so, we develop several econometric models based on panel data, which enable us to assess control measures’ effects while accounting for their spatial heterogeneity. Our computational experiments demonstrate that traffic reductions were more significant among higher-income drivers (1% reduction per each 100,000 pesos increase). Conversely, municipalities with a higher proportion of elderly residents saw less drastic decreases in traffic. Regarding the effectiveness of control measures, we confirm that the lockdown is affected by fatigue and social interaction. The fatigue implies that users do not fulfill the lockdown as time passes, reducing the effect of quarantines by about 50% during October, 2020. The social interaction effect suggests the lockdown is less effective when not all city's municipalities are restricted to travel, which might be an argument against dynamic or partial lockdowns."
550,5,"TITLE: Crowding on public transport using smart card data during the COVID-19 pandemic: New methodology and case study in Chile | KEYWORDS: Crowding measures; Global positioning system; SARS-CoV-2; Transport supply | ABSTRACT: Most crowding measures in public transportation are usually aggregated at a service level. This type of aggregation does not help to analyze microscopic behavior such as exposure risk to viruses. To bridge such a gap, our paper proposes four novel crowding measures that might be well suited to proxy virus exposure risk at public transport. In addition, we conduct a case study in Santiago, Chile, using smart card data of the buses system to compute the proposed measures for three different and relevant periods of the COVID-19 pandemic: before, during, and after Santiago's lockdown. We find that the governmental policies diminished public transport crowding considerably for the lockdown phase. The average exposure time when social distancing is not possible passes from 6.39 min before lockdown to 0.03 min during the lockdown, while the average number of encountered persons passes from 43.33 to 5.89. We shed light on how the pandemic impacts differ across various population groups in society. Our findings suggest that poorer municipalities returned faster to crowding levels similar to those before the pandemic."
551,5,"TITLE: Estimation of trip purposes in public transport during the COVID-19 pandemic: The case of Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; Public transportation; Trip purpose; XGBoost | ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic strongly affected the mobility of people. Several studies have quantified these changes, for example, measuring the effectiveness of quarantine measures and calculating the decrease in the use of public transport. Regarding the latter, however, a low level of understanding persists as to how the pandemic affected the distribution of trip purposes, hindering the design of policies aimed at increasing the demand for public transport in a post-pandemic era. To address this gap, in this article, we study how the purposes of trips made by public transport evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Santiago, Chile. For this, we develop an XGBoost model using the latest available origin-destination survey as input. The calibrated model is applied to the information from smart payment cards during one week in 2018, 2020, and 2021. The results show that during the week of maximum restriction, that is, during 2020, the distribution of trips by purpose varied considerably, with the proportion of trips to work increasing, recreational trips decreasing, and trips for health purposes remaining unchanged. In sociodemographic terms, in the higher-income communes, the decrease in the proportion of trips for work purposes was much greater than that in the communes with lower income. Finally, with the gradual return to in-person activities in 2021, the distribution of trip purposes returned to values similar to those before the pandemic, although with a lower total amount, which suggests that unless relevant measures are taken, the low use of public transportation could be permanent."
552,3,"TITLE: The elasticity of demand on urban highways: The case of Santiago | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This study examines the relevant flow variables on urban highways in Santiago de Chile. The objective is to contribute to the knowledge of the elasticity of the flow on highways in less developed nations, bearing in mind that existing studies tend to focus on European countries and the United States. Using panel data models and five-year information from Autopista Central in Santiago, we study the elasticity of tolls, gasoline price, diesel price, and economic activity. The results indicate that economic growth is the primary variable that explains the increase in flows, which has brought a sustained rise in the country's motorization rate. When distinguishing economic activity between mining and other sectors, it is observed that the relevant activity in Santiago is not mining. Additionally, the flow is inelastic to the toll rate in the short term, while elasticity increases in the long term. The flow is inelastic with respect to fuel prices but less so than toll tariffs."
553,3,"TITLE: The impact of bus punctuality on users’ decisions and welfare | KEYWORDS: Public transport; punctuality; reliability; user equilibrium | ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a public transport users’ scheduling model that considers crowding inside vehicles, waiting time, and punctuality as a reliability measure. Commuters simultaneously make two choices: the preferred bus and the timing to arrive at the bus stop (on time or late). Public transport punctuality is the probability of being on time or late, generating a parameter of public transport reliability. We compute users’ equilibrium, social optimum, and first-best pricing and analytically devise a methodology to obtain the second-best pricing. Using numerical analysis, we show that (i) punctuality plays an essential role in the commuter strategy modifying according to its level, (ii) commuters’ strategy changes according to how reliable the system is, and (iii) second-best pricing is efficient only for limited cases."

Recent technologies allow the analysis of driving behaviors at a microscopic level, allowing a naturalistic observation of such phenomenon through information collected unobtrusively. This paper assesses the factors that influence discretionary lane changes on an urban highway in Santiago, Chile, employing an interpretable machine learning approach. We use full real-world vehicle-by-vehicle data gathered from Automatic Vehicle Identification technology and individual public information of the vehicles and their owners, which allows us to understand patterns that might have different characteristics when performed in simulated environments. We provide insights about the causes that increase the likelihood of lane changes. For example, we find that: (i) the older the car, the less likely it is to change lane, (ii) younger drivers change lane more often, and (iii) motorcycles drivers are the most likely to change lane."
555,3,"TITLE: A deep learning approach for real-time crash prediction using vehicle-by-vehicle data | KEYWORDS: Crash prediction; Deep learning; Intelligent transportation systems | ABSTRACT: In road safety, real-time crash prediction may play a crucial role in preventing such traffic events. However, much of the research in this line generally uses data aggregated every five or ten minutes. This article proposes a new image-inspired data architecture capable of capturing the microscopic scene of vehicular behavior. In order to achieve this, an accident-prediction model is built for a section of the Autopista Central urban highway in Santiago, Chile, based on the concatenation of multiple-input Convolutional Neural Networks, using both the aggregated standard traffic data and the proposed architecture. Different oversampling methodologies are analyzed to balance the training data, finding that the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks technique with random undersampling presents better results when generating synthetic instances that permit maximizing the predictive performance. Computational experiments suggest that this model outperforms other traditional prediction methodologies in terms of AUC and sensitivity values over a range of false positives with greater applicability in real life."
556,3,"TITLE: Accessibility to opportunities based on public transport gps-monitored data: The case of Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: Accessibility; GPS; Public transport; Urban opportunities | ABSTRACT: We study buses' accessibility to education, health, and job opportunities in Santiago, Chile. Our approach computes travel times during a week using full real-world GPS data for the 6681 buses of the public transport system. The use of such disaggregated data allows us to calculate accessibility based on real operating conditions rather than planned schedules, as most previous contributions do. To develop our analysis, we divide the city into 1390 walkable zones, and we compute travel times between them. Then, we calculate the number of opportunities reachable from each zone to the rest of the zones, and we aggregate them at a municipality level. Our main finding is that public transport is not able to alleviate the inequality given by the geographical distribution of opportunities in the city. We also find that accessibility for public opportunities is quite more homogenous throughout the city compared to private opportunities. The center and north-east part of the city, where the wealthier municipalities locate, attain the highest levels of accessibility to jobs and private health institutions. The west part of the city shows worrying poor accessibility to complex hospitals, while the south part is excluded from job opportunities. Overall, policies should aim to mitigate these inequalities by improving the quality of public transport services. Conventional alternatives include increasing bus service frequency and expanding the dedicated infrastructure for public transport. In the long term, better city planning is required to facilitate spreading the opportunities all over the city."
557,3,"TITLE: The importance of flow composition in real-time crash prediction | KEYWORDS: Automatic vehicle identification; Flow composition; Logistic regression; Real-time crash prediction; Support vector machines | ABSTRACT: Previous real-time crash prediction models have scarcely used data disaggregated by vehicle type such as light, heavy and motorcycles. Thus, little effort has been made to quantify the impact of flow composition variables as crash precursors. We analyze the advantages of having access to this data by analyzing two scenarios, namely, with aggregated and disaggregated data. For each case, we build Logistics Regressions and Support Vector Machines models to predict accidents in a major urban expressway in Santiago, Chile. Our results show that having access to disaggregated data by vehicle type increases the prediction power up to 30 % providing, at the same time, much better intuition about the actual traffic conditions that may lead to accidents. These results may be useful when evaluating technology investments and developments in urban freeways."

This study examines the key attributes that IT companies seek in human talent amid the current labour shortage, aiming to identify the skills and competencies that align with industry demands and contribute to sustainable economic growth. Using a cross-sectional, quantitative approach, we employed a socioformative rubric to survey 113 IT professionals, including executives and decision-makers from leading global Big Tech companies in Mexico and the United States. The study identifies 11 strategic axes for workforce innovation training, highlighting the importance of customized human capital development to address the dynamic demands of the IT sector. Results reveal that practices such as the impact of innovation on business growth and the influence of geographic location or internet connectivity on talent distribution are highly prioritized, while networking and incentives for innovation development lag behind. These findings underscore the need for tailored training programs and strategic innovation practices to bridge skill gaps and maintain competitiveness in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. By providing actionable insights into innovation-focused workforce development, this study contributes to both academic discourse and practical strategies for IT organizations."

Based on the revised unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT-2), a theoretical model adapted to the study context was proposed. The impact of the attitude towards PowerPoint, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivations, and habit, in the intention to use and actual use of PowerPoint was evaluated. A survey was applied to 106 university professors from two Spanish universities, and the theoretical model was subsequently tested using a path analysis. The results suggest the existence of a direct non-critical path consisting of social pressure and habit, and an indirect critical path consisting of performance expectancy via the attitude towards PowerPoint. This research highlights the importance of critical reflection in the use of technological tools such as PowerPoint in classrooms. The practical implications of these findings to improve pedagogical practices are discussed."

From the socio-formative approach, it is considered a priority to rely on evaluative procedures that strengthen the teaching and learning processes. However, a search of various documents in databases of indexed and indexed journals revealed few instruments that evaluated academic essays of teacher training students. None of these considered socio-formative assessment and most of them lacked scientific validity processes, making them not very objective and reliable. Considering the above, the present study had the following purposes: 1) to design a Socioformative Estimate Scale (EES) according to the taxonomy proposed by socioformation; 2) to submit the EES for review and expert judgment; 3) to conduct a pilot test of the instrument; and 4) to analyze the psychometric characteristics of content and construct validity. The results show that the EES presented relevant levels of content validity (Aiken's V ≥0.75). The application with the pilot group (n = 15) showed an adequate degree of understanding, relevance and satisfaction. With regard to the confirmatory factor analysis, it showed two factors, which is in accordance with what was expected at the theoretical level or in the design of the instrument, with reliabilities above 0.9. It is concluded that the EES is relevant for assessing academic essays. Further validity and reliability studies with larger populations are suggested."

The objective of the study was to confirm the factorial structure of the Scale to evaluate Scientific Articles in Social and Human Sciences and to establish its convergent and predictive validity and invariance between gender. For this purpose, a nonexperimental, cross-sectional quantitative instrumental design was used, with a non-probabilistic sample of 405 Peruvian postgraduate teachers. The results showed that the proposed version of the scale corresponds to the theory and the unifactorial structure of the original model. The values of the comparative fit indices were acceptable (CFI=0.948; TLI=0.941); likewise, the goodness of fit was adequate (RMSEA=0.060). Evidence of convergent validity (VME=0.49) and predictive validity was found from the multiple regression analysis, since the scale was positively and significantly associated with the publication of articles, books, book chapters, and papers. It is concluded that the instrument presents adequate psychometric characteristics for its application in the Peruvian context."

The objective was also to determine whether there are differential profiles in the use and consumption of media related to the future role of these profiles in the audiovisual literacy of the students. To do this, a non-random sample was used comprising 881 Pedagogy students of both genders studying at seven universities in southern and central Chile. The «media consumption questionnaire» was used for data collection. In general, the distribution of preferences by gender and degree course falls short of representing idiosyncrasy in terms of the media, and reflects outside realities that do not permit participation in citizenry processes to be strengthened in media consumers. In short, the biggest problem is that future teachers do not seem to have the tools that allow them to manage the work of audiovisual literacy since they themselves have difficulties in differentiating between information and persuasion in advertising messages."

This paper develops a framework to understand the political-economic determinants of institutional response capacity through an examination of climate change governance in Mexico City and Santiago, Chile. We ask whether being a frontrunner (Mexico City) is an indicator of greater institutional response capacity. Although Mexico City has slightly higher levels of institutional capacity than Santiago, both are faced with similar challenges, such as fragmented governance arrangements, asymmetries in access to information, and topdown decision making. However, both also have similar opportunities, such as leadership, participation in transnational networks, and potential to integrate climate change goals into existing policy agendas. Examining urban climate change planning in isolation from other institutions is therefore likely to provide a false sense of a city's response capacity."

Using a non-experimental and cross-sectional design, a non-probabilistic sample of 337 users responded to a questionnaire about beliefs associated with both systems. Mean differences were evaluated according to ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and affiliation. It was found that the overall sample holds more negative beliefs about the public system and more positive beliefs about the private system. Additionally, regarding the public healthcare system, indigenous people have more positive beliefs, while non-indigenous people have more negative beliefs. Finally, it was found that individuals with a high socioeconomic level have more positive beliefs about the private health-care system compared to those with a low socioeconomic level. On the other hand, individuals with a high socioeconomic level have more negative beliefs and less positive beliefs than those with a low socioeconomic level regarding the public healthcare system. These findings can be understood in light of cer-tain stereotypes associated with healthcare systems. This is relevant because analyzing beliefs considering users' sociodemographic characteristics allows for the development of strategies that strengthen healthcare systems and reduce social inequities."

Enhancing COVID-19 protective behaviors, a study in Chile, Mexico, and Colombia | KEYWORDS: compliance; coronavirus; protective behaviors; risk perception; severity perception; social norms | ABSTRACT: The literature has suggested that social norms and perceptions of risk and severity are critical variables in predicting protective health behaviors. Using an integrative conceptual framework, this study evaluates educational level, socioeconomic status, injunctive pro-care norms, perception of risk, and severity of COVID-19 as predictors of hygiene behaviors, mask use, and physical distancing. Participants included 2,075 adults from Chile, Mexico, and Colombia, three countries with the worst pandemic management. A structural equation model including the hypothesized structure of relations among the study variables fitted the data well and was invariant among Chilean, Mexican, and Colombian data. As proposed, injunctive pro-care norms against COVID-19 predicted protective health behaviors directly and indirectly through the perception of the risk and severity of COVID-19, and educational level predicted pro-care norms against COVID-19. These findings are essential in light of the development of prevention campaigns and the promotion of COVID-19 care strategies."
570,18,"TITLE: Assumption of the Myths of Romantic Love: Its Relationship With Sex, Type of Sex-Affective Relationship, and Sexual Orientation | KEYWORDS: better-half; bisexual; consensual non-monogamy; exclusivity; monogamy; polyamory | ABSTRACT: Romantic love promotes and lays the foundation for the development of hegemonic affective sex relationships, guiding the normative ways of feeling and experiencing love. This way of conceiving love is an intrinsic part of women's subordination, and it entails a greater tolerance for situations of violence in sex-affective relationships in which the exercise of asymmetric power relations between men and women is legitimized. With the current advent of the postmodern stage, a wide variety of dissident (non-heterosexual) sexual orientations with heterosexual hegemony have been given greater visibility and legitimacy, and new ways of relating to sex affectively have emerged initially opposed to traditional romantic discourse, the fundamental pillar of monogamy. The aim of the present work was to study whether these different ways of linking us and understanding affective sex relations marked a significant difference with respect to the heterosexual monogamous hegemonic model in the assumption of the mythified ideas of romantic love. Therefore, we studied the relationship between sex, sexual orientation, and the type of sex-affective relationship (monogamous or non-monogamous by consensus) in the assumption of the myths of romantic love. For this purpose, an instrument that showed appropriate psychometric properties was created, and a cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 1,235 people who completed a self-administered online questionnaire. The results indicated that there were no significant differences according to sex, but there were differences in sexual orientation and type of relationship. It may be concluded that a person, regardless of sex, heterosexual or homosexual, monogamous or who has never had affective sex relations, will have a significantly greater probability of assuming the myths of romantic love than a person with a sexual orientation other than heterosexual or homosexual and who is in a non-monogamous consensual relationship."
571,5,"TITLE: To get vaccinated or not? Social psychological factors associated with vaccination intent for COVID-19 | KEYWORDS: beliefs; conspiracy theories; infection diseases; public health; vaccination intent; vaccine hesitancy | ABSTRACT: Pandemic control not only requires effective COVID-19 vaccines but also that they are accepted by at least 80% of the population. For this reason, understanding the social psychological variables associated with vaccination intent is essential to achieve herd immunity. Drawing on the theory of reasoned action, this study seeks to analyze vaccination intent using the beliefs about vaccine effectiveness, conspiracy theories, and injunctive norms as predictors. A non-probabilistic national online survey was conducted during December 2020. A sample of 1,033 people in Chile answered a questionnaire with the study variables. Using structural equation models, it was found that vaccination intent was explained in 62.1% by beliefs about vaccine effectiveness and injunctive norms, controlling for age, political orientation, socioeconomic status, educational level, and gender. Specifically, beliefs about vaccine effectiveness are based on people's experience with previous immunization processes, which predict vaccination intent. Regarding injunctive norms, they act by influencing and encouraging vaccination by seeking the approval of significant others. Contrary to expected, conspiracy beliefs were not directly associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but were highly related to lower beliefs about vaccine effectiveness. This study suggests that to enhance the vaccination intent, socio-psychological and structural variables need to be considered."

The literature on this matter indicates that to stay and succeed in college, students must have developed, prior to enrolling, a set of transversal abilities, which we have named 'academic preparedness'. The aim of the study was to construct a measuring instrument that would help identifying and measuring the specific array of factors that affect academic preparedness. Participants were 603 volunteer students from secondary and tertiary education. After performing the necessary exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, the definitive scale resulted in 67 items, grouped in 7 factors that explained 59.6% of variance. The availability of the Academic Preparedness Scale for Higher Education (EPAES) will allow the timely assessment of preparedness and the implementation of opportune remedial actions. This will contribute to retain students and therefore, to reduce the current university dropout rates."

In the present study, 1,070 pedagogy students from the northern, central and southern regions of Chile answered the MVS. This sample was randomly divided in two. Using the first sub-sample (N = 539), an exploratory factorial analysis was carried out, from which a structure of nine items was grouped into two factors called ""Social Success"" and ""Personal Happiness"", which presented adequate reliability. Later, with the second sub-sample (N = 531), the factorial structure indicated above was put to the test through a confirmatory factorial analysis. The data from the model show that the scale contains 8 items in total, grouped into two dimensions. The factorial loads are significant at the level of 1 %, which indicates that the 2-factor structure can be confirmed. Finally-using the proposed structure-the presence of the students' material values was evaluated. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

Available generation capacity of Haiti reaches 212 MW, which is insufficient to meet the estimated peak demand of more than 500 MW in the whole country. This deficit severely impacts basic essential facilities such as health care centers. The IEEE Student Branch PES Chapter at Georgia Tech established a project to design and implement a microgrid to supply power to a recently established health center in the mountains of Thoman, Haiti. Several combinations of power generating units were evaluated on an economic basis, including: a standalone diesel generator (DG), photovoltaic (PV) panels with batteries, and PV panels with batteries and a DG. Key parameters including power rating, daily energy production, maximum annual capacity shortage, etc., were also incorporated into the economic evaluation. This paper outlines the preliminary microgrid design steps, assessment of topology alternatives, site visit, detailed design and the fundraising process. Only commercial off-the-shelf parts were considered for device selection. To verify the preliminary design, a site visit was conducted in February 2015. Installation and commissioning is expected to take place later this year."

This context enabled cyberbullying against teachers from students, which negatively impact their well-being. Previous studies have focused on school violence against teachers, but less is known about cyberbullying against teachers while considering teacher burnout dimensions. We used a sample of 1,387 teachers (M = 42.2, SD = 10.1; female, 79.1%) from Chile, Peru, Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador. Using structural equation modeling, we found that higher levels of cyberbullying are associated with lower levels of teachers’ well-being and mediated by psychological exhaustion but not by enthusiasm toward the job scale. Our results confirm the adverse effects of cyberbullying on teachers’ well-being. We highlight two burnout dimensions as possible underlying mechanics to better understand this relationship. Therefore, prevention programs can include skills and teacher resources to deal with cyberbullying and burnout to moderate the negative impact on their well-being."
576,0,"TITLE: A pilot study of a micro-course to promote positive teaching practices and prevent exclusionary discipline in early childhood | KEYWORDS: Early childhood educator; Preventing exclusion; Professional development; Social and emotional development | ABSTRACT: The past two decades of research have underscored the concerning use of exclusionary discipline in early childhood education settings and the need for professional development to support educators to use evidence-based practices. Existing professional development, such as coaching and infant/early childhood mental health consultation, are effective but pose implementation challenges due to time and resource demands. The need for scalable, cost-effective professional development that focuses on social and emotional development and challenging behavior is higher than ever. Short, online, self-paced courses (what we refer to as “micro-courses”) are one approach to addressing these challenges. In this paper, we examine initial evidence for how a micro-course can support in-service early childhood educators to learn and use evidence-based universal strategies to support positive behavior, which may indirectly reduce exclusionary discipline. We leverage quantitative and qualitative data from 25 educators who piloted the course in spring 2022 to report on early childhood educators’ engagement and satisfaction with the micro-course and whether educators report any changes in their knowledge or practices. We found that early childhood educators actively participated in the micro-course, found the experience useful and relevant, and reported changes in their knowledge of and comfort with positive behavior support practices as a result of participation. This study can inform future policy, practice, and research efforts to equitably support children's positive behavior, prevent challenging behavior, and eliminate exclusion in early childhood settings."

In this preliminary and exploratory secondary data analysis study, we examined teachers’ self-reported use of classroom-based soft exclusionary discipline practices with kindergarten students whom they perceived as displaying the lowest self-regulation and social skills. In a sample of 2,053 teachers and 40,771 kindergarten students, teachers reported on their use of five soft exclusionary discipline practices and rated students’ self-regulation and social skills in the fall of the kindergarten year. Teachers reported variability in their use of soft exclusionary discipline practices with some practices being used multiple times per day by some teachers. Most variability in the use of these practices was at the teacher (rather than the school or district) level. Teachers reported using certain soft exclusionary discipline practices (break outside classroom, losing free time, and limit talking) more frequently when the racial composition of students they rated as having the lowest self-regulation and social skills included more Black students. Practice or Policy: Findings highlight the importance of better understanding the range and types of exclusionary discipline practices used with young students, and which children are most likely to experience them."
578,0,"TITLE: A conceptual model to understand and address racial disparities in exclusionary discipline through teacher-child relationships | KEYWORDS: Early childhood; Exclusionary discipline; Expulsion; Racial disparities; Teacher-child relationships | ABSTRACT: Young children in the United States, particularly Black boys, are being suspended and expelled from early childhood education programs and primary schools at alarming rates. Teachers describe children's “disruptive” or “challenging” behavior as the most common reason for suspending or expelling a child. For this reason, common efforts to reduce exclusionary discipline target teacher behavior to change child behavior (e.g., improve use of evidence-based practices) or child behavior directly (e.g., learn self-regulation skills). In this paper, we argue that improving the quality of the teacher-child relationship is an alternative mechanism for addressing exclusionary discipline and mitigating racial disparities in the early childhood years. We propose and provide support for a transactional, relational model to account for exclusionary discipline. The proposed conceptual model intentionally names how teachers’ racial bias and children's stereotype threat, resulting from racialized classroom experiences, exacerbate coercive teacher-child interaction cycles for Black children. We apply this model to review and evaluate select teacher-child relationship interventions to identify opportunities and challenges these interventions present to reduce exclusionary discipline and mitigate racial discipline disparities. We end the paper with recommendations for future research to advance relationship-based solutions to the exclusion crisis in early childhood education."

The study utilizes a sample of 714 children from 214 classrooms collected as part of the National Center for Research on Early Childhood Education Professional Development (NCRECE) study. Multilevel regression models using a bifactor analytic approach to measuring teacher-child interaction quality (resulting in three unique and uncorrelated factors) indicate that in classrooms with higher levels of responsive teaching practices, individual children exhibit greater peer sociability and assertiveness, but not communication. In classrooms with higher levels of cognitive facilitation, individual children display higher peer engagement across all measured dimensions (Sociability, Assertiveness, Communication), and greater observed potential for peer communication, operationalized as children's highest observed peer engagement score. Finally, in classrooms with more effective management and routines, individual children display lower peer sociability and assertiveness, but not communication. Implications are suggested for supporting children's peer engagement within early childhood classrooms."

Aligned with best practices, we examined the combined utility of two contextual measures, a teacher report and a direct observation of classroom behavior, in the context of interactions with teachers, peers, and learning tasks. Latent profile analysis (N = 527 children) identified four profile groups: (a) well-adjusted and positively engaged, (b) high externalizing and conflict engagement, (c) adequately adjusted/mildly disengaged in learning tasks, and (d) elevated internalizing behavior and low engagement. Children’s profile classification was associated concurrently with emotion regulation and social competence. Teachers independently reported on children’s social-emotional or academic concerns. Teachers’ reports of social-emotional concerns comported for children in the externalizing profile but did not comport for the internalizing group. Findings illustrate the utility of a contextual assessment approach for early identification and intervention, particularly for children who display internalizing behavior."
581,0,"TITLE: Teacher and Child Factors Associated with Emotion Talk between Teachers and Preschoolers Displaying Elevated Externalizing Behaviors | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Research Findings: Talking about emotions with their caregivers help young children develop emotional competence, and is particularly beneficial for children who display elevated externalizing behaviors. However, prior descriptive work has shown that teacher-child emotion talk in preschool classrooms is scarce. As children are spending increasing amounts of time in preschool programs, there is value in understanding the factors associated with teacher-child emotion talk for supporting these types of interactions. In this study, child and teacher factors associated with teacher-child emotion talk frequency were examined. Participants included 183 preschool teachers and 470 children rated by their teachers as displaying elevated externalizing behaviors in a mix of federally funded (Head Start), state funded, and private preschool programs within two eastern states in the United States. Emotion talk frequency was observed in the context of a standardized, dyadic teacher-child storybook reading task. Results from a multilevel model showed that emotion talk frequency was primarily explained by differences between teachers. Particularly, teachers talked with children about emotions more often when they (1) held an early childhood major and (2) were observed to engage in more responsive teaching. Policy or Practice: Results identify malleable teacher factors linked to teacher-child emotion talk frequency. Findings also highlight the role of preschool teachers as socializers of young children’s emotions and suggest the need for future research to understand how the quality of emotion talk varies between and within teachers."
582,2,"TITLE: Implementation of an early childhood mental health consultation pilot in Virginia: Critical tensions and implications for scale-up | KEYWORDS: early childhood education; early childhood mental health consultation; implementation; scale–up; social–emotional learning | ABSTRACT: Early childhood mental health consultation (ECMHC) is a targeted prevention service that aims to build the capacity of early care and education (ECE) professionals and foster supportive environments that promote children’s social–emotional competence and improve mental health and well-being. A key challenge to delivering ECMHC at scale is navigating complex multi-level factors to maximize successful implementation and program benefits at scale. The current study describes the implementation tensions arising during the first year of a pilot ECMHC program conducted in partnership across multiple agencies and a state’s department of education. In the 2021–2022 pilot year, ECMHC was offered as a free service to ECE programs in one large region of Virginia, with the goal of examining feasibility to scale statewide in future years. Consultation was implemented in 45 preschool classrooms across 30 programs. Implementation data were collected using consultation logs and participant surveys, and 20 participants (educators, families, program directors) participated in focus groups. Three implementation tensions are highlighted in this paper: (1) ideal plans versus reality of a new ECMHC roll-out; (2) how to support ECE professionals’ practice as it relates to children’s behavior, without contributing to a deficit view that children need to be “fixed;” and (3) systemic factors in the early childhood field that undermine the implementation and effectiveness of ECMHC. For each tension, we provide context from the larger literature on ECMHC, describe relevant decision points from Virginia’s pilot ECMHC program, and present implementation data to illustrate these tensions in practice. We conclude with reflections on lessons learned that have implications for other ECMHC and SEL intervention scale-up efforts."

This study provides a descriptive examination of the quality of individual children’s interactions with their teacher as a basis for understanding one source of information theorized to inform children’s and teachers’ perceptions of their relationships with each other. Children’s dyadic interactions with teacher, including their positive engagement, communication, and conflict, were observed across a large and racially/ethnically diverse sample of 767 preschool children (M = 4.39 years) at three time points in the year. On average, most children displayed low-to-moderate levels of positive engagement (78%), while nearly all children showed rare communication (81%) and conflict (99%) with the teacher. Boys demonstrated lower positive engagement and higher conflict with the teacher than girls. Black children were observed to demonstrate higher positive engagement with the teacher compared to White children. No differences in interaction quality were observed for Black children with a White teacher compared to White child-White teacher or Black child-Black teacher pairs. Results advance our understanding of dyadic teacher–child interactions in preschool classrooms and raise new questions to expand our knowledge of how teacher–child relationships are established, maintained, and modified, to ultimately support teachers in building strong relationships with each and every preschooler."
584,0,"TITLE: Bidirectional associations among teachers' burnout and classroom relational climate across an academic year | KEYWORDS: Classroom relational climate; Elementary school classrooms; Teacher burnout; Teacher psychological wellbeing; Teacher-student relationships | ABSTRACT: In the present study, we examined bidirectional associations between two components of teachers' burnout (personal accomplishment and emotional exhaustion) and classroom relational climate (closeness and conflict) across two time points within an academic year. Participants included 330 elementary school teachers (third and fourth grade) and 5081 students in a large, urban city in the northeastern United States. Students were primarily Hispanic/Latino (66%) or Black/African American (22%), and most were from low-income households. Forty-seven percent of teachers were White, 25% Black, and 31% identified as Hispanic/Latino. Two modeling approaches were used for preliminary detection of bidirectional relations among burnout and classroom relational climate. First, a crossed-lagged panel model showed a clear pattern from earlier relational climate to later burnout; closeness and conflict at Time 1 predicted personal accomplishment at Time 2, and conflict at Time 1 predicted emotional exhaustion at Time 2. No evidence was found for earlier burnout predicting later relational climate. Second, a set of latent change score models indicated that increases in closeness from Time 1 to Time 2 were associated with decreases in emotional exhaustion across the academic year. Together, findings provide preliminary evidence for associations from classroom relational climate to teacher burnout, but not the other way around. Implications of these findings for teachers and school psychologists are discussed."

The Role of Individual Children’s Interactions With Teachers and Peers | KEYWORDS: Emotion regulation; Emotion socialization; Inhibitory control; Peers; Teachers | ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation is foundational to children’s psychological wellbeing and future school adjustment. As young children are spending increasing amounts of time in preschool programs, investigating how early childhood classrooms can foster emotion regulation development is warranted. In this study, we tested individual children’s interactions with teachers and peers as potential mechanisms through which inhibitory control supports emotion regulation in the preschool classroom. Participants included 767 preschool children (49% female; M = 4.39 years old, SD =.08) from low-income households (income-toneeds ratio M = 1.45, SD = 1.06). Fifty percent of children were Black, 22% White, 13% Latino, and 15% Other race/ethnicity. Children completed direct assessments of inhibitory control in the fall, teachers reported on children’s emotion regulation in the fall and spring of the preschool year, and trained observers rated the quality of individual children’s interactions with teachers and peers in the fall, winter, and spring. Accounting for earlier emotion regulation, mediation analyses indicated that children’s inhibitory control operates through individual children’s (a) positive interactions with peers and (b) negative interactions with teachers and peers to support their subsequent emotion regulation. These findings underscore the role of the preschool classroom as an emotion socialization context for children from low-income households, along with providing additional evidence about the importance of social interactions to understand children’s emotional development in context."

In a sample of preschoolers (N = 470) rated by their teachers as exhibiting elevated disruptive behaviors, the quality of dyadic teacher–child interactions and children's security were observed using a standardized task. Children's engagement with tasks was both observed in the preschool classroom and rated by the teacher. Results indicated that the quality of teacher–child dyadic interactions was associated directly with teacher-reported task engagement, and indirectly associated, through a child's security, with observed task engagement. We discussed the contribution of these findings to our understanding of how the quality of dyadic teacher–child interactions may serve to regulate children's behavior in the classroom for children whose teachers perceive them as displaying early externalizing behaviors."

Though previous work has drawn attention to the high levels of burnout teachers report experiencing and its impact on students, comparatively less work has investigated what influences teachers' burnout itself. Guided by Lazarus' (1991) transactional model of stress and coping, the present study explored the links between the proximal resource of teachers' relationships with students and burnout. Specifically, we investigated the association between classroom aggregated teacher reports of relational closeness and conflict, and two components of burnout: personal accomplishment and emotional exhaustion. Results indicated that teachers who reported close relationships with their students also reported higher levels of personal accomplishment over the academic year, whereas more conflictual relationships were associated with increased emotional exhaustion. Implications for relational quality with students as a central influence on teachers’ wellbeing are discussed."

Banking Time is a dyadic, short-term intervention to improve the quality of teacher–child interactions between a teacher and a specific child, building a more positive teacher–child relationship. During Banking Time sessions, both teacher and child interact toward an activity chosen by the child. This study used variable- and person-centered approaches to examine Banking Time implementation in a sample of diverse preschool teachers (N = 120) and children (N = 319) randomly selected to participate in the intervention. Results indicated that the majority of teachers implemented expected practices (i.e., observe and narrate the child’s actions, allow the child to lead) as intended. However, although teachers were instructed to limit teacher-directed practices (i.e., ask questions, give praise, and use commands), teachers’ use of these practices was not as limited as ideally expected. Three different implementation patterns were evident: (1) High Fidelity, in which the teachers engaged in the child’s activity while ensuring that the child led the session; (2) Low Engaged, in which the child led the session, but the teacher was not engaged in the child’s activity; and (3) Teacher-Led, in which the teacher was engaged in the child’s activity but also directing the session instead of ensuring the child’s lead. These implementation patterns were linked to changes in the quality of teacher–child interactions. Implementation findings from this study can inform interventions to improve the quality of teacher–child interactions."
590,0,"TITLE: Does Fidelity of Implementation Account for Changes in Teacher–Child Interactions in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Banking Time? | KEYWORDS: fidelity of implementation; Preschool; randomized trial; teacher–child relationships | ABSTRACT: This study examined fidelity of implementation in a randomized trial of Banking Time, a classroom-based intervention intended to improve children's behavior, specifically for those at risk for developing externalizing behavior problems, through improving the quality of teacher–child interactions. The study sample comes from a randomized controlled trial that took place over three years and included 183 teachers and 470 preschool children recruited across three sites. Results exploring fidelity of implementation indicated that Banking Time practices were present across treatment and nontreatment groups. In addition, the presence of more Positive Banking Time Practices accounted for improvements in teacher–child interactions while Restricted Banking Time Practices showed inconsistent patterns, relating both to positive and negative teacher–child interactions. Further, random assignment to Banking Time resulted in the presence of more Positive Banking Time Practices and fewer Restricted Banking Time Practices, which accounted for the improved teacher–child interactions. Thus, findings point to the critical need to better account for intervention fidelity across conditions in randomized trials, allowing for better understanding of the mechanism through which interventions lead to intended outcomes."

The workshop comprised 7 sessions lasting 90 minutes, each of which involved collaborative activities oriented towards story creation. A two-phase methodology was used: contents and evaluation tools were developed first, with the workshop being implemented afterwards. Children identified as shy or disruptive by their teachers scored higher in self-esteem tests after the workshop. The overall analyses are not conclusive regarding the global impact of the workshop on socio-emotional development. It should be pointed out that both children and teachers who participated reported high satisfaction levels with the experience. The article also presents a discussion on the potential of the workshop as a significant socio-emotional development experience."

The results of a questionnaire on perceptions of students in relation to opportunities for the development of high leverage practices in their education programs are discussed. The instrument was designed with the purpose of monitoring a process of curriculum redesign aimed at putting practice as the core of the training process and to look for evidence for adjustment of the change process. The instrument was applied to 1,294 students of disciplinary, methods and field experience courses and asked their perception about coherence and opportunities to different approximations to practice in the courses. The results between courses are compared. Less than half of students (percentage ≤ 50%) indicated having opportunities to rehearse high leverage practices in methods and field experience courses at the university."

594,0,"TITLE: Engagement and qualitative sociology in health research: proximal, but incongruent | KEYWORDS: Health Research; Lived Experience; Patient and Public Involvement; Qualitative Sociology; Second-Order Observation | ABSTRACT: This paper argues that sociology’s distinctive value in health research lies not in amplifying experiential accounts but in analysing the social structures and norms that shape them—a contribution often obscured by an assumed alignment between qualitative research and engaged health agendas. Typically rooted in a shared valuation of lived experience and patient voice as credible sources of knowledge, arguments for alignment are often aimed at carving out a niche for the qualitative social sciences within applied health research. However, such arguments can overlook the need to combine experiential accounts with analytic frameworks, and can treat experiential accounts as sufficient explanation rather than as a vital contribution to enquiry. Drawing on Niklas Luhmann’s concept of second-order observation, we problematise the assumption of alignment, situating it as the product of three developments: patient-led struggles for the recognition of lived experience in biomedicine; efforts of social scientists to distance themselves from biomedicine’s normalising gaze; and the institutionalisation of patient engagement in healthcare research. Through theoretical articulation, qualitative sociology situates patient accounts within broader transformations in health systems and society, contributing to understanding and explanation, not merely engagement and representation. Engagement and qualitative sociology are vital and distinct, and their difference enables a dialectical relationship through which each challenges and transforms the other."

After being associated with communism and socialism, community-based mental health work was banned, and socialist psychiatrists were silenced through torture or exile. However, some therapeutic initiatives persisted, such as the “Protected Commune” (PC) initiative within the El Peral psychiatric asylum. The PC attempted to mimic a real town inside the asylum's gated perimeter. It featured an ecumenical chapel, a school, and various “council” departments like recreation, education, waste, economy, and health. Paths received names, wards became districts, and patients and workers were assigned new, democratic roles, all while the authoritarian regime entirely controlled the “outside” world. The initiative ceased with the return of democracy in 1990. Deemed an eccentric and negligible episode, the PC is often seen as an interruption to the radical community-based experiences of the pre-dictatorial era. Drawing on archival research and oral history interviews with participants, this paper examines how the PC harnessed the notion of community to navigate the complex socio-political landscape of the dictatorship. Differing from established accounts of the political uses of psychiatry under authoritarianism, the study positions the PC as a prism for understanding the contradictory ways in which the idea of 'community' has been able to transcend radically opposed social and political regimes, becoming a core feature in the vocabulary of mental health reform, despite its ambiguities."

Based on two ethnographies, we argue that the work with both groups interrogates mental health practitioners regarding the scope of their disciplines and on a professional-individual level. Rather than passively reproducing discourses and practices of domination, practitioners embody contradictions and conflicts triggered by the incompatibility between psy-disciplines; the knowledge and practices anchored in Haitian-Creole medicine and Vodou; and the radical questioning of diagnoses and treatments developed by activist service-user and ex-user groups. Practitioners question and challenge the universalist conceptions of identity, the mind, suffering, and treatment. Rather than an intellectual exercise, we emphasize that a call for decolonization implies the politicization of professional practice in –or outside– the borders of psychiatry and mental health as a system of government."
598,2,"TITLE: Critical reflections on the concept and impact of “scaling up” in Global Mental Health | KEYWORDS: Global Mental Health; India; innovation; scaling up; sustainability | ABSTRACT: The field of Global Mental Health (GMH) aims to address the global burden of mental illness by focusing on closing the “treatment gap” faced by many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To increase access to services, GMH prioritizes “scaling up” mental health services, primarily advocating for the export of Western centred and developed biomedical and psychosocial “evidence-based” approaches to the Global South. While this emphasis on scalability has resulted in the increased availability of mental health services in some LMICs, there have been few critical discussions of this strategy. This commentary critically appraises the scalability of GMH by questioning the validity and sustainability of its approach. We argue that the current approach emphasizes the development of mental health services and interventions in “silos,” focusing on the treatment of mental illnesses at the exclusion of a holistic and contextualized approach to people's needs. We also question the opportunities that the current approach to GMH offers for the growth of mental health programmes of local NGOs and investigate the potential pitfalls that scalability may have on NGOs’ impact and ability to innovate. This commentary argues that any “scaling up” of mental health services must place sustainability at the core of its mission by favouring the growth and development of local solutions and wider forms of support that prioritize social inclusion and long-lasting mental health recovery."

The chapter analyses the constantly changing protocols and norms, as a source of uncertainty, as well as the own characteristic of the virus and the lack of protection equipment. HCW had to deal with the unknown in real time developing strategies to cope with it. The following pages highlight their ability to cope with these context as well as the lessons learned during 2020."

602,2,"TITLE: Beyond Participation: Politics, Incommensurability and the Emergence of Mental Health Service Users’ Activism in Chile | KEYWORDS: Incommensurability; Mental health systems; Politics; Reflexivity; Service user organisations | ABSTRACT: Although the organisation of mental health service users and ex-users in Latin America is a recent and under-researched phenomenon, global calls for their involvement in policy have penetrated national agendas, shaping definitions and expectations about their role in mental health systems. In this context, how such groups react to these expectations and define their own goals, strategies and partnerships can reveal the specificity of the “user movement” in Chile and Latin America. This study draws on Jacques Rancière’s theorisation of “police order” and “politics” to understand the emergence of users’ collective identity and activism, highlighting the role of practices of disengagement and rejection. It is based on interviews and participant observation with a collective of users, ex-users and professionals in Chile. The findings show how the group’s aims and self-understandings evolved through hesitations and reflexive engagements with the legal system, the mental health system, and wider society. The notion of a “politics of incommensurability” is proposed to thread together a reflexive rejection of external expectations and definitions and the development of a sense of being “outside” of the intelligibility of the mental health system and its frameworks of observation and proximity. This incommensurability problematises a technical definition of users’ presence and influence and the generalisation of abstract parameters of engagement, calling for approaches that address how these groups constitute themselves meaningfully in specific situations."

604,4,"TITLE: First application of FASAT-Charlie Imagery for the assessment of semiarid prairies in Chile Primera aplicación de imágenes Fasat-Charlie al estudio de praderas semi-áridas de Chile | KEYWORDS: Fasat-C; Semi-arid region; Vegetation index-Chile | ABSTRACT: The semi-arid region of Chile has gained great relevance in the recent decades mainly due to the constant desertif ication process it's suffering, the increase of climatic extreme events occurrence and the decrease in the precipitation volume. This scenario makes the region a zone of great scientific relevance to the scientific community for the study and analysis of recent climatic events and their relationship with the land cover change process. In this context, satellite technologies now available to Chile could help towards a consistent delivery of updated information from this area. The Satellite System for Earth Observation (SSOT/Fasat-C) controlled by the Chilean Air Force (FACH) carries on board the multispectral sensor NAOMI-1 which has a spatial resolution of 5.8 meters for the blue (455-520 nm), green (528-588 nm), red (625-695 nm) and near infrared (758-881 nm) bands, and a spatial resolution of 1.45 meters for the panchromatic band (455-744 nm). Among its main objectives are land use change detection and monitoring in the Chilean territory, in order to create the basis for a response system in the case of extreme events, and to allow time series study of natural surfaces affected by climate change. In this paper the radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction of a Fasat-Charlie scene was carried out. Spectral signatures of vegetation, bare soil (Aridisol) and concrete were obtained from surface reflectance values. The spectral behavior was then compared with information from the Aster Spectral Library (ASL), and a similar behavior was found. Then, four vegetation indexes were calculated, those are: Simple Ratio (SR), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), LAI (Leaf Area Index) and MSAVI (Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index). The estimated vegetation indexes showed low magnitudes, which could be explained by the scarce characteristics of the vegetation. The MSAVI index showed to be the one that best represented this scarce distribution of the vegetation. These results show the potential that the Fasat-Charlie has as a tool for the monitoring, study and analysis of land covers affected by constant global changes."

In this sense, daily ET was estimated in a Mediterranean rainfed landscape of the Central Chile, based in meteorological in situ data, and two satellite scenes (ASTER and MODIS). The surface energy balance model S-SEBI was calibrated to estimate the evaporative fraction, from the spatial contrast of reflectance and surface temperatures from ASTER. The atmospheric profiles from MODIS (MOD07) and the maximum and minimum air temperature from meteorological stations were considered to obtain net radiation, considering the topographic heterogeneity derived from a digital elevation model taken from ASTER as well. Results reflected the heterogeneity of the landscape, with an ET of 5.8 ± 1.8 and 6.4 ± 2.1 mm.d-1, en both scenes, depicting the variability of land use, which encompass bare soils, crops, forests and water bodies. The use of the S-SEBI model represents an efficient procedure in the prediction of the actual ET in vast territories. This information is essential in the calculation of the water balance and water consume in areas, where the hydric resources are unknown and the in situ measurements scarce. The carrying out of this methodology represents a valuable alternative for the decision-making in the territorial planning of the hydric resources."
606,5,"TITLE: The Economic Value of Caregiving in Chile | KEYWORDS: Caregivers; economic factors; long-term care; opportunity cost; replacement cost; workforce | ABSTRACT: Population aging will increase the demand for long-term care services. Many countries, including Chile, have not implemented comprehensive responses to address these demands, relying on informal care. This article aims to estimate the economic value of caregiving in Chile, contributing to filling a gap in the literature and the policy debate. Economic value is estimated using replacement and opportunity cost approaches using two nationally representative databases: one survey on time use (to estimate hours of caregiving) and one on socioeconomic characterization (to identify caregivers and wages). Regressions for the determinants of caregiving effort and wages in the formal labor market are used to calculate the market value of caregiving time. Results show that the yearly value of caregiving ranges between US$266 million (when assuming a wage equal to the minimum wage for all caregivers) and US$4,946 million (when replacing all caregivers with nurses), i.e. between 0.11% and 1.95% of the country’s gross domestic product. The analysis provides several estimations of the economic value of caregivers in Chile and, even considering these calculations can be underestimated, the results show the need to highlight and value the contribution of caregivers and implement policies to address the increase in long-term care needs in the country."
607,5,"TITLE: How Do Attitudes of Adult Children Toward Long-Term Care Change with Education? International Evidence | KEYWORDS: Education; filial beliefs; instrumental variables estimation; long-term care | ABSTRACT: Global demographic trends indicate that the world population is aging and education acquisition is increasing. For the first time in history, people are expected to spend more years as adults with living parents than as a parent of teenage children, and the average years of schooling have increased dramatically over the past several decades for many countries. Additionally, family-provided care is still the most important form of care to meet care demands worldwide. As strong filial norms could affect older adults’ long-term care decision-making, understanding the link between filial obligations and education is critical under these trends. Using individual data from the World Values Survey and an instrumental variables strategy to account for endogeneity, this study finds that adult children with higher education levels have lower filial beliefs. Since population aging is expected to increase the demand for long-term care services, and education can reduce the supply of family-provided long-term care services, countries must start addressing this gap."
608,2,"TITLE: Extending the Analysis of Functional Ability Trajectories to Unexplored National Contexts: The Case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Disability; Functional ability; Life course; Trajectory | ABSTRACT: Objectives: Despite the enormous advances in the field, most evidence about functional ability trajectories in old age comes from studies conducted in developed and high-income countries. This research aims to build on these previous advances to examine functional ability trajectories in Chile. Method: Drawing on a robust, publicly available 15-year panel data set (2004-2018), and using sequence analysis, we examine functional ability trajectories types among 4 age groups (people aged 46-50, 51-55, 56-60, and 61-64 at baseline). Then, we analyze trajectories' dynamics looking at intraindividual health-declining and health-recovery transitions between functional ability statuses, within each trajectory type. Finally, we assess how multiple baseline individual characteristics predict the likelihood of following a functional ability trajectory type, using multinomial regression models. Results: Across all age groups, an important fraction (between 26% and 50%) reports stable healthy trajectories, and between 10% and 20% follow equivocal-declining trajectories (i.e., exhibiting both health-declining and health-recovery intraindividual transitions), suggesting that age might not be the main source of heterogeneity in functional ability trajectories. Overall, women, lower educated people, nonworking individuals, and people with a higher burden of chronic conditions at baseline are more prevalent among health-declining trajectory types; however, these results are not constant across the age groups analyzed. Discussion: This nationally focused study reinforces the feasibility and usefulness of an in-depth analysis of functional ability trajectories in old age. The study findings can be crucial to define different prevention strategies according to the functional ability path that an individual might follow, especially in countries like Chile that currently navigate the challenges of population aging."

Through its National Service for Older Adults, the country implemented a strategy to prevent and mitigate infection and spread in long-term care facilities (LTCF), reaching regulated and registered residences and, for the first time, informal and unregistered residences. Objective: Identify the challenges and lessons from the COVID-19 response in LTCF with respect to the support received, the implementation of infection control measures, workforce challenges experienced and the measures adopted to promote residents’ wellbeing. Methods: An online questionnaire was sent to all LTCF managers (N = 385, Response Rate = 32.4%). Statistical tests compare results to identify differences across LTCF characteristics: residence size, location and management type (private, public or subsidized, or informal). Findings: Irrespective of their location, size or management, managers highlight common challenges during the crisis. They include limited personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, staff shortages, low quality of replacement staff, reduced staff mental health, and the difficulty to understand and implement protocols. Managers acknowledge receiving institutional support in the form of PPE provision and opportunities for staff training, but managers noted the need to expand this support to cover staffing surge needs, staff psychological needs, and ensure the continuity of clinical support for residents as well. Managers share a common demand for a more coordinated response from public institutions. Managers recognize that the pandemic and the measures implemented to mitigate it negatively affected staff morale and residents’ wellbeing. Many noted that peer-to-peer support was a mechanism to support staff. Limitations: Results might be subject to selection bias. Data collection covered a limited period of time at the early stage of the pandemic. Implications: Findings are relevant to assess the COVID-19 response and to better prepare for another COVID-19 wave or similar health or environmental threats in the future."
611,5,"TITLE: Enablers and Barriers to Implement COVID-19 Measures in Long-Term Care Facilities: A Mixed Methods Implementation Science Assessment in Chile | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; implementation science; long-term care; nursing homes | ABSTRACT: Background: As elsewhere, in Chile the COVID-19 affected disproportionately older people, and particularly people living in long-term care facilities. Considering this problem, the Government issued a series of guidelines and protocols to prevent and manage COVID-19 outbreaks in these facilities. Methods: This study aims to identify barriers and enablers that affect the implementation of these prevention and management measures. For the analysis, we used an implementation science approach and a mixed methods strategy — a survey among facilities’ managers and interviews among staff — classifying enablers and barriers into four categories: agreement with the intervention’s goals, financial resources to implement the measures, technical needs of the intervention, and cultural factors in the facilities. Results: Results highlight the importance of the four factors above in the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and protocols. Managers and staff differ in their view of the main enablers and barriers for implementation. However, they both identify the knowledge about the measures and availability of personal protective equipment as enablers and human resources as a potential barrier. Conclusions: The identification of several factors related to goals and culture highlights the need to adopt a broad implementation approach when designing interventions for long-term care facilities, avoid-ing restricting the discussion to the availability of resources. Highlight: • Understanding implementation factors is key to design and assess successful interventions. • The prevention and management measures implemented in the Chilean facilities found barriers (e.g., infrastructure, human capital and resistance to chance), and enablers (e.g., PPE availability and trust in technical staff) that could have impacted the effectiveness of the measures proposed. • Tackling the identified implementation barriers using feasible and evidence based strategies could improve the effectiveness of the measures."

In this context, long-term care systems appear as a feasible solution to the multidimensional issues arising from demographic change. However, designing a long-term care system is complex. This article presents a structure to analyze long-term care systems based on four components: beneficiaries, benefits, providers, and financing. It uses the experience of three countries to illustrate the many choices available when designing the system, emphasizing the need to understand each component and their interactions. The analysis highlights the existence of several alternatives when designing and implementing long-term care systems."

This situation reflects their natural endowment and mining tradition, but is also the result of development processes undertaken over the last decades. As a result, both countries multiplied its mine copper production in more than 3 times in the last 20 years. Mining labor productivity played a central role achieving these amazing growth rates. Although there is a consensus about the relevance of this variable for the mining industry, the specific factors behind labor productivity changes are not completely understood.In this paper we use a panel data approach to analyze labor productivity in the copper mining sector in Chile and Peru from 1992 to 2009. This technique is consistent with heterogeneity among mines and allows us to identify, describe and analyze all the different sources behind labor productivity changes.The result of the analysis shows that better deposits and operational factors are important, but not enough to explain labor productivity improvements in the copper mining industry, and instead, company specific efforts and wide industry changes, such as technology and management innovations, are as important as the evolution of the reserve base or geological features of the operations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."
614,1,"TITLE: Gender balance and geographical diversity in editorial boards of Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta and Chemical Geology | KEYWORDS: Editorial boards; gender diversity; geochemistry; geographic diversity; journal publishing | ABSTRACT: Background: Members of editorial boards of academic journals are often considered gatekeepers of knowledge and role models for the academic community. Editorial boards should be sufficiently diverse in the background of their members to facilitate publishing manuscripts representing a wide range of research paradigms, methods, and cultural perspectives. Objectives: To critically evaluate changes in the representation of binary gender and geographic diversity over time on the editorial boards of Chemical Geology and Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, flagship geochemistry journals, respectively, from the European Association of Geochemistry and the Geochemical Society – Meteoritical Society partnership. Methods: The composition of editorial boards was ascertained as given in the first issue of each year, over 1965–2021 for Chemical Geology and 1950–2021 for Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, and members of the editorial boards were coded for their country of affiliation (the country of origin may have been different) and for their binary gender. Results: Gender parity, limited to men and women, and the number of countries of affiliation increased steadily between the late 1980s and 2021. However, the geographic distribution remained dominated by affiliations from North America and Western Europe. The editor-in-chief or board of editors had a significant impact on the diversity of the editorial boards, and both geographic and gender diversity may evolve with nearly every newly appointed editor. However, the persistently substantial under-representation on editorial boards of affiliations outside North America and Europe is of concern and needs to be the focus of active recruitment and ongoing monitoring. This approach will ensure that traditionally low geographic diversity is increased and maintained in the future. Conclusion: Improving diversity and inclusion of editorial boards of academic journals and strengthening journal and disciplinary reputations are mutually reinforcing. Instituting a rotating editorship with emphasis on embedding broader geographic networks and more equitable international recruitment could ensure sustained and wider geographic representation and gender balance of editorial boards and promote originality and quality of published research, representing our global communities."

Data were gathered through two online surveys that explored the use of multimodal texts by teacher educators and pre-service teachers. Results indicate that educators were familiar with the standards and multimodality when teaching reading and writing, but lack of resources, preparation, and time prevents them from working with multimodal texts. Candidates read printed and digital newspapers, novels, and magazines outside university, but rarely use them academically. They extensively use social media, even for academic purposes. There is a mismatch between the use of multimodal texts by teacher candidates and teacher educators."

Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a qualitative methods approach, utilizing an instrumental case study. As the primary data source, researchers conducted 14 individual, semistructured interviews. Participants included two comentors, six mentor teachers and six mentee teachers from two K-8 focal school sites. Data were examined using the content analysis method. Findings: Results revealed five aspects that contributed to PM's execution: the voluntary participation model, the reflective emphasis, the focus on teaching and learning, the facilitating role of the principal and comentor support. At the same time, the findings indicated three factors that hindered PM's success: interruptions due to schedule conflicts, limited dissemination throughout the school community and assimilation of the values embedded in the Chilean teacher evaluation system. Practical implications: PM holds great potential for collaborative professional development and continuous improvement of teachers' instructional practices, drawing on their experiences and resources and leading to the strengthening sense of professionalism in teaching and in teachers' social esteem. Originality/value: This is the first research to address a formal PM project in Chile aimed specifically at in-service teachers. Previous projects in the country have focused on novice teachers. Unlike other initiatives in the region, this project does not focus on teacher induction but on capacity building within schools through collaborative work. This research also adopts an approach based on support for teachers' professional development, while in Chile the main policies currently focus on teacher evaluation."

That is why this article seeks to rethink and resignify the international evidence on mentoring in order to contribute to the production of contextualized knowledge. A multiple case study was conducted, guided by the following research objective: Conceptualize a 'good mentoring' and a 'good mentor' considering the voices of the actors involved in Chilean induction programs for novice principals executed in 2017. 21 interviews were conducted with principals, mentors and program coordinators; and then a thematic analysis by case and across the cases was carried out. The results allow defining common characteristics of a 'good mentoring' and a 'good mentor' among the interviewees and deriving guidelines to adequately contextualize mentoring in the induction programs for novice school principals."

At the school system level, there is a growing body of literature related to the design, implementation and effects of these reforms. However, there is little attention to these policies at the level of early years education. This article aims to analyze systems of quality assurance at this educational level in different countries. For this purpose, the results of a comparative research are presented that included the study of eight countries/regions: Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, United States (Colorado), England, Italy (Reggio Emilia) and Sweden. The research identifies two models that respond to different socio-historical contexts and traditions in educational policy; named “performance accountability” and “professional-communitarian accountability”. The paper concludes with lessons from both models."

This failure has been explained from several approaches and, although many government and private initiatives currently exist, their results show no significant educational achievements. Te purpose of this theoretical paper is to establish the conceptual research foundations for a study on teaching staff, from the perspective of the thoughts and beliefs of the teachers themselves, which we believe are the key to understanding their performance. Basic adaptive mechanisms would lead to the teacher developing simple knowledge -inaccessible to consciousness- to resolve problems without unnecessary cognitive effort. This would lead to classroom activities guided more by a belief system rather than through formal knowledge. If these facts are ignored, then the traditional practices will continue to be reproduced."
623,0,"TITLE: The future of the economist's utopia in the Chilean school systemI | KEYWORDS: Evaluations; Market; Parents; Quasi-markets; State | ABSTRACT: The radical transformations of the Chilean education system carried out by the military dictatorship during the 1980s were designated as an ""economist's utopia"" given that they converted a preferably public and centralized system into one governed by the rules of the free market. Under this assumption, we examine the new system's development, which quickly defaulted on its promises of providing efficiency and high quality education. With this objective, this study demonstrates the deterioration of the aforementioned utopia and how the analogy to the free market proved false. The role of the state as a regulator, provider and guarantor of the education system is criticized, as well as the disparate and occasionally contradictory use of information regarding the educational reform. Lastly, we examine the participation of parents and how the role assigned to them by the reform differed from their actual participation in the system. We conclude by noting that, in order to overcome the aforementioned problems, it is necessary to replace the logic employed during the formulation of these policies three decades ago with a more expanded outlook that offers sound answers to the problems confronted by the Chilean education system in regard to its quality and equality."

This subsidy supplements the contributions madeto educational institutions in other ways, adding resources for each""priority"" student (from a low socioeconomic background) that is attended to, as well as for the proportion of students in thiscondition within the institution. Its purpose is to support establishments with the latest financial resources so that theyfulfill the terms of a ""performance agreement"" associated witheducational goals of diverse types. For some authors, this instrument implies a paradigm shift in relation to the previous financial instruments. For others, it is a modernization based on the same foundation. While a more modern intention is seen, in practice it takes on the role of a typicalmarket incentive. For that reason, it does not respond to an alternative paradigm. This dispute has relevant nuances and points of view, which are reviewed in the text."

This work will address three main topics. First, it offers a description of linguistic competence as an explanatory paradigm of the notion of competence. Second, three different approaches towards competency-based education are examined, starting with a comparison with objective-based pedagogy, then from a historical perspective and finally from a conceptual approach, taking into account the need for a Pedagogy ""without dichotomies"". Finally, several views about competence in education will be examined in order to highlight the conception as ""understanding the situation"", in an attempt to discuss their senses and scope, based on the conceptual framework derived from the examination of linguistic competence."

The main results confirm that students in rural areas have fewer opportunities than those in urban areas, which means that rural students face disadvantages in terms of academic achievement, due to historical inequalities. The scores show that remedial policies are necessary in specific areas, such as: access and retention in preschool education, reduction of student failure rates, maternal education programs, etc., that could have a positive impact on students in rural areas, significantly reducing the current situation of inequality."
628,-1,"TITLE: Disaster narratives on Instagram: How the editorial focus connects with audiences in Chile Narrativas de desastres en Instagram: Cómo el foco editorial conecta con las audiencias en Chile | KEYWORDS: Communication; disaster; editorial focus; Instagram; journalism | ABSTRACT: People's need for information increases in the face of highly relevant news, such as socio-natural disasters. Social networks have become one of the preferred sources of information over traditional media. However, different ways of presenting content can be received differently by audiences. Based on the case study of the floods that affected central Chile in June and August 2023, this paper explores how the editorial focus (understood as a strong idea that confers a specific intention to the visual narrative) of the publications in Instagram accounts of eleven Chilean media outlets is related to the emotional tone and relevance to the news of the comments made by the public. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, it stands out as a finding that publications with a complementary and redundant editorial focus are those that generate more comments from the public. In contrast, in the case of complementary content, comments trigger an interaction related to the post's information that suggests an understanding and discussion about what was published."

Through 91 in-depth interviews, it identifies the transformations and repercussions of this evolution and the role that fear plays in audience attraction practices such as clickbait; in actions to protect journalists such as self-censorship and anonymity, as well as the emergence of new reporting dynamics such as the “selfie recorded testimonial”."
630,11,"TITLE: A Credibility Divide? Discerning Truth From Misinformation in Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Studies on misinformation often overlook people’s assessment of true information, focusing instead on beliefs in and sharing of false content. This is problematic, as it limits scholars’ ability to produce an accurate assessment of citizens’ capacity to distinguish between true and false content.To shed light on this matter, this study relies on a two-wave online survey (Nrespondents = 465) to examine people’s truth discernment, that is, how much they believe and share true content relative to false content. It does so in Chile over two different crises: after the 2019 protests (Wave 1, November 2019), and at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (Wave 2, May–June 2020). While true information was deemed credible more often than false information, discernment tended to be better for those who had a better perception of traditional media content and those more politically engaged. Conversely, credibility and sharing of false content tended to be more common with younger people and those with high levels of trust in social media. Over time, levels of credibility and sharing discernment remained stable."

A qualitative approach was used based on 41 in-depth interviews with practicing journalists during both events, followed by 50 interviews with editors of traditional and alternative media who reflected retrospectively on the consequences of these events for the profession. The analysis concluded that Chilean journalism experienced in the past four years stages similar to those of grief: denial, anger, negotiation, depression, and acceptance. Both the social outbreak and the pandemic accelerated the modernization and adaptation processes to new technologies by Chilean newsrooms and, at the same time, forced professionals to rethink and redefine the scope of journalism as a profession."

Does this relationship change according to freedom levels of media systems and degrees of political polarization? To answer these questions, this study analyzes data from 10 Latin American countries included in the last round of the World Values Survey (2017-2020) (N = 11,769), as well as indices of governments' intervention in the news system and polarization by the V-Dem project. Statistical results show that, in general, exposure to news on social media is negatively related to trust in government and state institutions. However, context makes a significant difference: the higher the level of media freedom and polarization, the more negative this relationship becomes. In contrast, traditional media news use is positively associated with political trust, regardless of contextual factors. This confirms the importance of considering micro and macro news media contexts when analyzing trust in Latin America."

It focuses on three aspects: the impact of the digital environment on the practice of journalism, the use of social networks in the traditional media, and the professional routines' opportunities and risks. We conducted a qualitative study based on 21 semi-structured in-depth interviews to explore the protagonist's perceptions. Results show that, although the digital environment has put a strain on the traditional journalism role of gatekeeper, its fundamental aspects are still valid as pillars of the profession to preserve quality standards. Journalists and media outlets tend to see certain social media-such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram-as an opportunity to streamline their work and increase their reach, even though they recognize risks and threats that burden their independence and that come mainly from the pressure of the audience. Finally, media are using multiple strategies and protocols to face the dangers of the digital environment."

We conducted a series of empirical data collection stages (background gathering through in-depth interviews and content analysis) and later applied the theory-building block approach that uses concepts to create and operationalize constructs. The main result is a six-dimension model based on the traditional questions of the journalistic process: How, why, who, when, what, and where. It comprehensively addresses the multiple aspects involved in disaster coverage: Emotional, logistic, professional, and ethical challenges, as well as timing, key actors/roles, and their needs and demands according to the disaster type and stage they face. The model also brings together a group of potential activities journalists must confront and carry out when covering major disasters or highly significant social crises. Its main contribution is to make a useful theoretical tool available to academia and the media, striving for a versatile matrix management approach."
635,-1,"TITLE: What “Emergency Sources” Expect From Journalists: Applying the Hierarchy of Influences Model to Disaster News Coverage | KEYWORDS: authorities; communication; disasters; experts; journalism; sources | ABSTRACT: This study analyzes what “emergency sources” (authorities, emergency managers, and experts) expect from journalists during a disaster, using a mixed-method approach with six focus groups and a survey of 166 official Chilean sources. Based on the first three levels of the hierarchy of influences model, we explore how they perceive journalists’ roles and performance when covering disasters. The results suggest that emergency sources’ evaluations, while affected by a combination of individual, routine, and organizational variables, are mostly shaped by sources’ direct and mediated experience with journalists. Thus, a more fluid relationship between journalists and emergency sources, as well as more communication experience by sources, could lead to a better understanding between both groups, which, ultimately, may lead to delivering more accurate and timely information."
636,5,"TITLE: Competing Frames and Melodrama: The Effects of Facebook Posts on Policy Preferences about COVID-19 | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; experiment; framing effects; melodrama; News frames; social media | ABSTRACT: The tension between health and economic considerations regarding COVID-19 has resulted in a framing contest, in which proponents and adversaries of strong containment measures hold oppositional frames about the pandemic. This study examines the effects of competing news frames on social media users' policy preferences and the moderation of framing effects played by melodramatic news treatment. Results from a pre-registered online survey experiment in Chile (N = 518) show that participants exposed to Facebook posts with an economic frame were significantly less supportive of measures that restrict mobility (e.g., quarantines) than participants in the control group. Contrary to expectations, exposure to a public health frame also reduced support for stay-at-home orders, and the presence of melodramatic features had no significant impact on users' preferences. Other variables, however, did alter these framing effects, such as fear of COVID-19 and frequency of social media news use. These findings paint a rather complex picture of framing effects during the pandemic in a digital media environment."
637,11,"TITLE: Distances and affinities between doramas and local fictions according to Chilean screenwriters: melodrama in Switched Distancias y afinidades entre doramas y ficciones locales según guionistas chilenos: el melodrama en Switched | KEYWORDS: dorama; melodrama; scriptwriters; teenagers; telenovela; TV | ABSTRACT: Increasingly, the screens of Latin America, in both broadcast and pay TV or streaming, have expanded their offer of Asian fictions with high melodramatic content. In them, it is possible to find elements that approach it and others that distance it from the Latin-American television genre par excellence: telenovelas. This work seeks to understand the reasons behind the success of doramas in Latin America from an interpretive-professional perspective based on semi-structured interviews with Chilean scriptwriters of telenovelas, who discussed the series Switched as a case study. The results suggest that, among the characteristics that potentially link its success in Latin America are, on the one hand, the rescue of elements of classic melodrama —archetypes, a strong love story, universal conflicts— and, on the other, a restructuring of the genre linked to the Asian cultural idiosyncrasy and the use of narrative and audiovisual elements attractive to the youth-adolescent public."

This phenomenon tends to be criticized by experts, professionals, and members of the audience who associate melodrama with sensationalism or the coverage of irrelevant events. This article presents the results of two studies carried out in Chile using qualitative methods (focus groups, in the first case, and in-depth interviews, in the second). They aimed to explore the audience's perceptions of the use of melodramatic resources in the Chilean open television news and the characteristics they value and reject, and find differences in such perception regarding informative coverage of highly emotional news, such as disasters. The results show mixed perceptions, between criticism and optimism, as the participants in both studies highlight that, while excess melodrama bothers them, its inclusion in news programs develops empathy and moves them to action. As to the coverage of disasters, stories are perceived differently between those affected and not affected by their consequences."

It is based on the five essential elements of psychosocial care presented by Stevan E. Hobfoll et al. (2007) that can be introduced after a potentially traumatic event: promoting a sense of safety, calming, self and collective efficacy, connectedness, and hope. This study developed a method to relate these elements to television coverage and applied it to the stories (n=1,169) aired by the main networks in Chile in the 72 hours after an 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck on 27 February 2010. Of the five elements, promoting a sense of safety occurred most often (82.72 per cent), whereas the others were barely present (less than 10 per cent). The study argues that these elements can increase the possibility of framing the news, given that the audience watching can also be affected by a disaster."

This was used to identify and describe the presence of three potential profiles: informative (descriptive presentation of the content), judgmental (a judgment position prevails), and of dialogue with the audience (direct message to viewers). The data shows that the predominant profile was the informative one, whereas the judgmental appears strongly during the first days of disaster and then weakens, and that the dialogue with the audience is strengthened from the third day. These results open a line of research on the role of the media to promote the spontaneous recovery of a population faced with a trauma."

A Chilean team investigated the role of communications in the strategic, journalistic and audiovisual areas. The goal was to identify its processes, actors, relationships, environment variables and relevant performance indicators and to develop a common theoretical-conceptual framework with relevant quality indicators for evaluation and improvement. The main result of the research is a platform, Work Key, with separate components for the three areas. It also considers that each professional can “take their office with them,” thanks to synergistic components designed for smartphones and tablets. Its conclusions tend to contribute and establish interesting nuances in a discussion regarding the impact of technological changes and to supply new tools to face current difficulties in the communicative process."

This paper faces these challenges through the analysis on how journalists, editors y directors from the four most important television stations in Chile reacted during the coverage of the February 27, 2010 earthquake in that country, one of the biggest in human history. Through in depth interviews analysis, and their systematization, the research proposes a classification of the challenges that journalism faces in coverage of natural disasters in four groups (emotional and psychological effects, logistical difficulties, restricted access to information, and ethical dilemmas) that divides them in specific factors and their respective intervening elements. © 2013 Communication&Society/Comunicación y Sociedad."
645,-1,"TITLE: Skipping the Bag: The Intended and Unintended Consequences of Disposable Bag Regulation | KEYWORDS: environmental regulation; taxation; unintended consequences | ABSTRACT: Regulation of goods associated with negative environmental externalities may decrease consumption of the targeted product, but may be ineffective at reducing the externality itself if close substitutes are left unregulated. We find evidence that plastic bag bans, the most common disposable bag regulation in the U.S., led retailers to circumvent the regulation by providing free thicker plastic bags, which are not covered by the ban. In contrast, a regulation change that replaced the ban with a small tax on all disposable bags generated large decreases in disposable bag use and overall environmental costs. Our results suggest that narrowly defined regulations (such as plastic bag bans) may be less effective than policies that target a more comprehensive set of products, even in the case when the policy instrument itself (a tax rather than a ban) is not as strict."

The present study uses a quasi-experimental design and propensity score matching (PSM) to estimate the ECCE effect by comparing ECCE participants with those who did not attend but share similar family and contextual characteristics. We follow a cohort of 80,000 children from preschool to the end of schooling. Results show that ECCE participants had better academic outcomes than their peers who did not participated in ECCE in national tests in 4th, 10th, and 12th grade. ECCE participants also were less likely to repeat a grade or to dropout of school. Practice or Policy: These findings suggest that public ECCE might play a key role in both reducing the socioeconomic achievement gap and supporting futures opportunities for children."

It is associated with depression, cognitive decline, chronic diseases, and increased mortality, affecting clinical decision-making and treatment adherence. Despite its relevance, health sciences training programs, particularly in medicine and nursing, do not adequately address this issue, creating a gap in professional education. It is essential for healthcare professionals to acquire skills to identify and manage loneliness, including empathy, ethical decision-making, and effective communication with older patients. However, current training prioritizes technical aspects without integrating the emotional and social factors that influence patient well-being. An innovative educational strategy is proposed to incorporate loneliness as a social determinant of health within health sciences curricula. This training would include workshops on communication with older adults, clinical simulations focused on loneliness, and an interdisciplinary approach involving social work, psychology, and medicine. This strategy would promote more comprehensive care, improving the quality of life and well-being of older adults."

Evidence in Chile is scarce. Objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and active commuting in the Chilean population. Methodology: we analysed data from 5292 cases related to walking speed (brisk, normal, slow) and 1861 cases of active commuting via walking or cycling (measured in minutes) from the Chilean National Health Survey 2016-2017. The fitness was estimated using five equations. The association between fitness, walking speed, and active commuting was assessed through linear regression models, both unadjusted and adjusted for sociodemographic, anthropometric, and health-related confounding variables. Results: in the unadjusted models, ""brisk"" walking speed was associated with a fitness increase ranging from 3.3 to 4.5 mlO2/kg/min. After adjusting for sociodemographic, anthropometric, and health variables, the fitness increment for ""brisk"" walking speed ranged from 0.1 to 3.7 mlO2/kg/min in three models (all p < 0.001). Conversely, for every one-minute increase in active commuting via walking or cycling, the fitness increased between 0.06 and 0.07 mlO2/kg/min in four unadjusted models (p < 0.001). Consequently, a daily increase of 10 minutes in active commuting, sustained over five days, was associated with a fitness increment ranging from 28.5 to 32 mlO2/kg/min. Conclusions: engaging in ""brisk"" walking and increasing the duration of walking or bicycle commuting significantly enhanced fitness, irrespective of sociodemographic, anthropometric, and health factors."

In this way, cardiovagal training is recognized as a treatment that not only modifies physical condition but also helps regulate the autonomic system and inflammatory markers. The objective of this study was to analyze the results of an 8-week cardiovagal training program by evaluating the autonomic, inflammatory, and metabolic responses in obese individuals. A total of 28 obese participants were stratified according to their HOMA-IR: the group without insulin resistance (NIR) and the group with insulin resistance (IR). The participants underwent cardiovagal training for 8 weeks. Metabolic variables such as insulin, leptin, TNFa, IL6, and the HOMA-IR index were considered, as well as variables of heart rate variability (HRV). The results show that the differences in change between pre- and post-intervention inflammatory markers represented favorable changes in IL10 (NIR -0.21 and IR -0.45 pg/ml) and in TNFa (NIR -0.23 and IR -0.51 pg/ml). In terms of HRV, the changes were favorable (p=<0.005) for SDNN (NIR 3.17 and IR 17.32 ms), RMSSD (NIR 11.45 and IR 23.27 ms), and LF/HF ratio (NIR 0.74 and IR 2.25 Hz). It is concluded that after 8 weeks of intervention, cardiovagal training in obese individuals with IR increased parasympathetic modulation and attenuated inflammatory markers."

Despite the relevance of learning about these attitudes, in Chile, there are no reliable and validated instruments to measure them in workers. An instrumental study was carried out to adapt and psychometrically analyze the Spanish version of the Scale of Attitudes towards People with Disabilities (EAPCD) in the Chilean population. By means of a non-probabilistic convenience sampling, 310 people between 19 and 76 years of age (M = 39.4; SD = 11.2) from different regions of Chile participated in the study. The linguistic adaptation included the change in Spanish idioms and expressions to the Chilean context, whose relevance was validated with cognitive interviews. Descriptive analysis, internal consistency analysis, and CFA (confirmatory factor analysis) were performed. The CFA indicated an adequate fit to the three-factor model proposed in the original scale (χ2(431) = 808.070, p < 0.01; RMSEA = 0.053; CFI = 0.93; TLI = 0.93). The Social Relations and Normalization dimensions were reliable; however, it is recommended that the items of the Intervention Programs dimension be revised or eliminated, since they could be confusing in the local context. It is concluded that the scale is reliable and valid to evaluate attitudes towards the inclusion of people with disabilities in Chile in the work context."

The reliability and validity were assessed through a pilot study conducted with a population of students with intellectual disabilities (ID). The linguistic adaptation was executed according to expert judgments of each indicator: adequacy, coherence, relevance, and clarity. After the scale adaptation, a scale pilot was conducted to explore its technical properties. It was performed in a public school for students with ID. The validity coefficient result was 0.998, while the complete reliability result was α = 0.978. For the reliability subscales, the results were the following: autonomy α = 0.941, self-initiation α = 0.925, self-direction α = 0.970, self-regulation α = 0.804, and self-concept α = 0.935. The results confirm the AUTODDIS scale as a valid and reliable instrument to evaluate self-determination. However, it is necessary to apply this scale to a larger number of students with ID to generalize these results."

Hallazgos de una encuesta de rendimiento y salud escolar del sur de Chile 2018 | KEYWORDS: Active Commuting; Chile; IFIS; Physical Fitness; Schoolchildren | ABSTRACT: Although current research indicates that the active mode of displacement commuting influences the health of schoolchildren, what is known about the relationship between self-reported physical fitness and its relationship with active commuting to school (ACS) is known less so. In addition, trends highlight the need to conduct country-specific analyses to understand each context better. The aims of this study were a) to analyze self-reported physical fitness and the ACS, and b) to determine the association between self-reported physical fitness and the ACS through an extensive survey in southern Chile. A cross-sectional analytic design was conducted. The sample consisted of 733 schoolchildren (aged 10 to 16, 46.1% girls) from Chilean public schools. The International Fitness Scale (IFIS) was used to determine the self-reported physical fitness. The ACS was assessed using separate questions about commuting to and from school. The main results showed that the boys presented better self-reported physical fitness than the girls, except in the self-perception of flexibility (p= 0.041). In addition, an association was observed between the ACS and the self-reported flexibility (OR:1.53, p=0.022; OR:1.47, p= 0.036), an association that was maintained when adjusting for sex and age (OR:1.55, p=0.020; OR:1.50, p= 0.030), and self-reported speed and agility was associated only with active commuting from school (OR:1.60, p=0.005), also after adjusted model (OR:1.81, p=0.024). In conclusion, this study provides evidence regarding the relationship between self-reported physical fitness and active ways of ACS. Strategies that favor ACS should be sought to promote health in schoolchildren."

However, sociodemographic variables that may either facilitate or impede the engagement in physical activities, such as education, income, gender, and marital status, have been insufficiently explored. Furthermore, limited attention has been given to these variables concerning specific physical activities, including gymnastics, aquatic activities, yoga, pilates, and dance. Objective: The aim of this study is to delineate the sociodemographic profile of physically active older adults based on the specific type of physical activity they participate in. Procedure: A sample of 358 individuals aged over 60 years (M = 69.66, SD = 4.74) participated in the study, utilizing the Quality of Life Scale and a sociodemographic questionnaire, specifically the CUBRECAVI. Results: The findings indicate that older adults engaged in gymnastics are more likely to possess lower academic qualifications (p < .001), lower income (p < .001), and be women (p = .003). Additionally, single and divorced individuals participate in dance activities at a higher rate compared to other activities (p = .004). Conclusion: In summary, the choice of physical activity among older adults is associated with their educational level, income, gender, and marital status."

To analyze the self-esteem of Chilean students from public schools and determine its association with sleep hygiene variables, after the first year of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Method. The study had a non-experimental, descriptive, and analytical design, with a cross-sectional temporal dimension. A convenience non-probabilistic sample of 265 students from 7th to 12th grade (between 11 and 18 years old) of both sexes from the town of El Carmen, southern Chile, participated in an online questionnaire about context, self-esteem, and sleep habits. Analysis of results. A majority of students perceived themselves with average or low self-esteem (26.4% and 24.9%, respectively). It was found that students who usually fell asleep before midnight, did not wake up tired or did so occasionally, did not have nightmares, and did not usually have trouble falling asleep had higher self-esteem than those who fell asleep after midnight, woke up tired regularly, had nightmares, and had trouble falling asleep, respectively. Conclusions. It was concluded that a high percentage of students had average or low self-esteem, and that students who reported having better sleep hygiene had higher self-esteem compared to those who had worse sleep hygiene. In this way, further studies are necessary to address these topics, especially in contexts of uncertainty, where it is presumed that they could have an impact on both lifestyle habits and mental health."

For this reason, this study aimed to examine the physical and emotional dimensions of older adults in the context of the pandemic, considering their history of virus infection. To carry out this analysis, we employed the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS), the Gratitude Questionnaire (CG-6), the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Visual Analog Scale for Pain Assessment (VAS), the Sleep Quality Scale (CS), and the Self-Reported Physical Activity Scale (FAF).This study was based on a sample of 71 individuals aged between 55 and 75 years (M= 63.07 years; SD= 5.49). The findings revealed that older adults who had previously been infected by the virus exhibited better mental health compared to their non-infected counterparts (p = .049, d = 0.48). Additionally, this group showed a higher tendency to engage in regular physical activities (p = .042; Phi = .250) and experienced an improved quality of life. However, it is noteworthy that stress and happiness levels in both groups were comparable, regardless of whether they had been exposed to the virus or not. In summary, this study suggests that older adults who had overcome COVID-19 infection demonstrated better outcomes in certain indicators of their physical and emotional well-being compared to those who had not been exposed to the virus."

It has been shown that martial arts are an effective intervention in controlling the symptoms of children and adolescents. However, there needs to be reviews that focus on synthesizing this evidence. Objective: Synthesize the current information on the effects and characteristics of carrying out martial arts programs and their effects on autistic traits in children and adolescents. Methodology: Systematic review that adheres to the Prisma 2020 declaration. The search was carried out in the Scielo, PubMed, Pedro, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, Springer Link, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases, and randomized and non-randomized clinical trials were selected. Results: Martial arts as a therapeutic intervention had statistically significant beneficial effects on stereotyped behavior 100% (5 of 5 studies), social interaction 100% (3 of 3 studies), emotion management 100% (3 of 3 studies), regulation of behavior 75% (3 of 4 studies), behavioral problems 75% (3 of 4 studies) and difficulty communicating 75% (3 of 4 studies). The most widely used martial art as a therapeutic intervention program was karate. Conclusion: The most evaluated areas in autistic treats are stereotyped behaviors, behavioral problems, social interaction, and communication difficulties. Finally, it was observed that the martial arts programs had favorable effects on ASD symptoms in behavioral, social, and communication skills."
658,20,"TITLE: Predictors of Health Satisfaction in Spanish Physically Active Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study | KEYWORDS: aging; elderly; functional ability; health satisfaction; physical activity | ABSTRACT: Studies that analyze the predictors of satisfaction with the health of the elderly are scarce. That is the reason why the objective of this study is to analyze whether the physical-psychological state, sports practice, and the use of socio-health resources are factors that predict satisfaction with health status in physically active elderly people. The Physical Activity and Quality of Life questionnaires were applied to a sample of 397 elderly people in this cross-sectional observational study. The data have been analyzed using Student’s t-test chi-square test, Cohen’s d, Phi Coefficient and Cramer’s V. The results have shown that the lack of physical illnesses (OR = 3.920; p < 0.001) and psychological problems (OR = 1.940; p = 0.032), practicing a high level of physical activity (OR = 2.049; p = 0.001), having high scores in functional skills (OR = 8.059; p < 0.001) and using little social and health services (OR = 2.595; p < 0.001) are all predictors of being highly satisfied with one’s health. In conclusion, predictors associated with high health satisfaction of active older people have been found, such as functional abilities, the existence of physical illness, psychological problems, level of physical activity, frequency of use of health and social services and satisfaction with health and social services; but it is not associated with gender or age of participants."

We systematically searched in databases MEDLINE, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and SciELO, of randomized control trials published up to July 2020 of classroom-based physical activity interventions with children´s psychological health variables as outcomes. Sixteen trials (14,877 participants) with children aged 6 to 12 years were included. There were significant effects on several indicators of: a) psychological health outcomes: well-being, self-esteem, body image satisfaction b) self-efficacy and motivation to physical activity and c) behavior inside the classroom: self-regulation, bullying and disruptive behavior. The most effective interventions are those that included physical activity integrated into the curriculum 2-5 times a week, in sessions between 4' to 10', implemented mainly by the classroom teacher and with audio-visual support. However, the heterogeneity in program designs did not allow definitive conclusions. While psychological outcomes are mainly primary outcomes in the interventions studied, more evidence is required on other indicators of psychological health such as mental health symptoms. In addition, studies need to employ objective measures of physical activity to a better comprehension of their effects on psychological health of schoolchildren."

Various measurement scales were utilized, including the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS), the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS), and the Gratitude Scale (CG-6). The sample consisted of 71 participants aged between 55 and 75 years. The results indicated that men exhibited higher levels of subjective happiness, better mental health, greater quality of life, and lower perceived stress and pain compared to women. However, when considering the variable of COVID-19-related deaths, significant differences were observed only in mental health and perceived stress between men and women among participants who had not experienced close losses. In conclusion, this study revealed differences in the physical-emotional state between men and women during the pandemic. Furthermore, it was found that the proximity of COVID-19-related deaths had a differential impact on mental health and perceived stress according to gender. These findings contribute to understanding the psychosocial effects of the pandemic on older adults and underscore the importance of considering gender differences in physical and emotional health during crisis situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic."

Objective: To examine the differences in motivation, barriers and benefits between the practice of physical exercise via mHealth and in person. Method: Pre-experimental study in 37 adults (96.5% women, 43 ±10.5 years old) from the Biobío, Chile, who participated in a physical exercise intervention via mHealth. The Exercise Behavior Regulation Questionnaire (BREQ-3), and the Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale (EBBS). Results: After the intervention, the mHealth physical exercise group presented a higher external regulation type motivation score (3.25 ±3.79 v/s 1.08 ±1.60; t(33.676)= 2.434, p= 0.020, d= 0.676), a lower integrated motivation score (3.25 ±3.79 v/s 1.08 ±1.60; t(33.676)= 2.434, p= 0.020, d= 0.676), and a lower index of self-determination in the practice of physical exercise (45.25 ±26.54 v/s 67.38 ±19.61; t(35)= -2.635, p= 0.012, d= 0.908) than the group face-to-face physical exercise. No significant differences were observed in the barriers and benefits for the practice of physical exercise. Conclusions: The exercise via mHealth generated greater external motivation and less integrated motivation compared to the face-to-face exercise. These findings support the potential of mHealth technology to promote physical activity motivation and overcome perceived barriers."

The objective of this review was to characterize school based physical activity programs and their effects on the health of schoolchildren with ASD. The review was carried out in accordance with the PRISMA statement in the databases, Medline and PsycINFO, between the years 2010 to 2023. A total of 20 articles were analyzed. A total sample of 683 schoolchildren with ASD (x=̄10.5 years and 73.1% male) were included. Schoolchildren with ASD had 98.1% adherence to the programs. The school based physical activity programs were mainly based on aerobic exercises, such as walking, jogging, running, and cycling (45% of the articles) with a duration between 10-16 weeks (55% of the articles), with a frequency of 2-3 times a week (60% of the articles) and with 60-minute sessions (45%). On the other hand, the most studied variables were language and motor skills (60% of the articles) and psychosocial and cognitive function (50% of the articles); together with the variables of physical and nutritional activity, these were where a higher percentage of articles with positive effects were found. The findings suggest a profile of schoolchildren with ASD and the main characteristics of school based physical activity programs in schoolchildren with ASD in terms of their extension, frequency, duration, intensity, location and provider as well as the variables most frequently evaluated and with the greatest positive effects."

This study aimed 1) to describe and compare the HR during exercise between HTN and normotensive adults and 2) to describe the endothelial function and related vascular parameters in both groups. A descriptive clinical study was conducted with 64 adults (men and women) who were divided into three groups: arterial hypertension (HTN n=26), elevated blood pressure (Ele n=16), or normotensive control (CG n=22). The participants underwent an incremental cycling exercise test of 5 stages, where HR (primary outcome) was measured, and secondary vascular outcomes (percentile classification of the pulse wave velocity (%ILEPWVba), maximum carotid intima-media thickness (cIMTmax), and arterial age among others were measured. In stage 2 of the test (50-100 watts), the HTN group showed significantly higher HR vs. CG (+14 beats/min; p<0.05) and vs. Ele group (+15 beats/min; p<0.05), and in stage 5 (125-250 watts), HTN group showed higher HR vs. CG (+22 beats/min; p<0.05). HTN group showed a higher arterial stiffness by %ILEPWVba classification and arterial age estimation than the CG group. In conclusion, HTN patients reported a higher HR response only in two out of five (monitored) stages of the Astrand cycling exercise test than normotensive peers. Moreover, all groups showed a higher HRpredicted than real HRpeak obtained from the exercise test. These results are displayed with more altered vascular parameters in the HTN group."

However, there is little evidence of this association in Chilean university students. The objective was to analyze students from a Chilean university’s attitudes towards older people, according to sociodemographic and educational variables. Analytical and cross-sectional study; 515 students from a Chilean university were consulted online about their attitude towards older people using Kogan’s Attitudes towards Old People scale. Additionally, sociodemographic and educational variables were recorded. The average score for positive attitude was 70.8 (±9.7), while the negative attitude score was 68.3 (±11.6). The total score was 139.1 (±16.6). Mostly, university students perceive themselves with a low-level positive attitude (61.2%). Additionally, older university students (26–42 years old); women; Chileans; students of law, speech therapy, and occupational therapy; students in their final years of the programs; and those who had training in older people outside the university have a more positive attitude towards older people. In Conclusion, a profile of sociodemographic and educational characteristics of students with a lower and higher attitude towards older age was investigated. These results are relevant since the way of seeing the aging process could regulate the training of future professionals and consequently generate changes in dealing with older people. Young people’s perception of ageing would affect the treatment and incorporation of the older people in society and the adaptation of policies in this age group."

For this reason, the aim of this work has been to evaluate, among physically active older adults, whether the level of physical activity they perform and the factors that foster their quality of life can be predictors of their satisfaction with life. For this, the IPAQ, CUBRECAVI and LSI-A scales were applied to a sample of 397 people between 61 and 93 years old (M = 69.65, SD = 4.71). The results show that health (β = 0.373), functional abilities (β = 0.159) and environmental quality (β = 0.105) are predictors of satisfaction in the most active adults. In conclusion, neither physical activity (to a greater or lesser extent) nor income are predictive variables of satisfaction with life but, rather, predict some of the components that cement their quality of life (health, fending for themselves and the home environment)."

This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Articles were searched in MEDLINE by PubMed, ELSEVIER by SCOPUS and SciELO. The MeSH terms «Exercise», Exercise Therapy» and «Aged» were used between 2015 and 2020. We searched for articles in Spanish, English, and Portuguese carried out in people aged 65 years and over.101 out of 4,642 randomized controlled trials (RCT) were included. A total sample of 5,013 older adults (79% women), with an average age of 68.2 years started their studies and 4,312 finished it, presenting an adherence to the interventions of 86%. Most of the studies were carried out in healthy older adults, in places enabled for the practice of physical activity, in charge of a physical activity professional, and the interventions were performed carried out through group therapeutic exercise. No article reported information on the minimum time of participation to the session to be considered as carried out. Only 30% of the articles reported the minimum participation of older adults in the intervention to include them in the study analysis, and 21% reported the average number of sessions attended to the intervention. The main reasons for abandonment were personal causes unrelated to the intervention. Only 5% of the articles reported injury of one of the participants (in two of them the injury was related to the intervention applied). This review characterized the physical exercise programs in older adults in Latin America, as well the adherence characteristics and the main reasons for abandonment to physical exercise-based interventions, by summarizing available evidence derived from RCTs."
669,8,"TITLE: Alternative strategies for scaling up marine coastal biodiversity conservation in Chile | KEYWORDS: Artisanal fishers; Marine conservation; Marine protected area; Municipalities; Navidad; Territorial user rights | ABSTRACT: The continued degradation of marine ecosystems, along with the ecosystem services they provide, suggest that new, innovative approaches are needed to scale up marine biodiversity protection and promote sustainable fishery practices. We synthesize information from Chile on the key processes involved in the development of alternative strategies for scaling up marine biodiversity conservation and discuss the complementarities with marine protected areas. Defined as “ancillary” marine conservation initiatives under the Convention of Biological Diversity, we suggest that these alternative strategies have the potential to capitalize on local stakeholders’ participation and contribute to solving livelihood and governance issues while playing a significant role in scaling up marine conservation. We specifically focus on two recent ancillary initiatives being piloted in Chile. The development of business model innovations which could enable biodiversity benefits from territorial user rights fisheries policies and the creation of municipal conservation areas. We identify how these initiatives could eventually help scale up marine conservation, discuss opportunities and challenges from these pilot experiences and conclude with the need for developing policy frameworks and cross-scale governance approaches which formally acknowledge marine ancillary conservation measures as part of an integrated way to manage marine biodiversity. Exploring and supporting alternative complementary marine conservation strategies is particularly relevant in Chile and Latin America, if biodiversity conservation initiatives are to scale in coverage, contribute to livelihood improvement of local communities, replenish fisheries and play key roles in adaptation to climate change."
670,3,"TITLE: Examining the geometry of streets through accessibility: new insights from streetspace allocation analysis | KEYWORDS: London; street design; street networks; streetspace allocation; urban form | ABSTRACT: This paper describes streetspace allocation analysis, a method that uses street cross-sections to measure footway and carriageway widths and quantify a key parameter of street design citywide. The resulting network-based streetspace allocation metrics are employed on a proof-of-concept study of train station service areas in London, applying shortest-path analysis under a place and walking prioritisation approach. Overall, streetspace allocation statistics for London confirm the citywide predominance of space allocated for vehicular transport over pedestrian uses. A comparison of the current distribution and proposed re-allocation of streetspace on streets near stations allows for the investigation of the effects of streetspace enhancements, which tend to be beneficial in reducing pedestrian movement impedance and extending service areas. The methods presented here can offer valuable analytical capacity for developing new transit-oriented schemes and designing place-based streets that support sustainable transport and sustainable urban development."

Multi-disciplinary frameworks for reading economic systems as integral to the design and lived experience of the public realm have shaped our conceptualisation of the financial crisis as a city design problem. The following images and narrative offer a socio-spatial and political analysis of the City of London as a 'business as usual' city in which private interests trump public good. Through a design-based proposal for policy intervention and physical restructuring that radically alters the City's socio-spatial realities, we re-imagine the City of London as a true public city for the 21st century, where 'productivity' stems from the residential diversity, urban intensity and inclusive public spaces produced by significantly increasing the number of people living in the City. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."
672,-1,"TITLE: Valuation of projects with minimum revenue guarantees: A Gaussian copula–based simulation approach | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This technical note presents a numerical simulation technique to perform valuations of infrastructure projects with minimum revenue guarantees (MRG). It is assumed that the project cash flows—in the absence of the MRG—can be described in a probabilistic fashion by means of a very general multivariate distribution function. Then, the Gaussian copula (a numerical algorithm to generate vectors according to a prespecified probabilistic characterization) is used in combination with the MRG condition to generate a set of plausible cash flow vectors. These vectors form the basis of a Monte Carlo simulation that offers two important advantages: it is easy to implement and it makes no restrictive assumptions regarding the evolution of the cash flows over time. Thus, one can estimate the distribution of a broad set of metrics (net present value, internal rate of return, payback periods, etc.). Additionally, the method does not have any of the typical limitations of real options–based approaches, namely, cash flows that follow a Brownian motion or some specific diffusion process or whose volatility needs to be constant. The usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a simple example."

Universities have to reflect on the needs rendered from the environment and to follow the complex processes of transformation and modernization in the public management realm. For Chilean case, the modernizing agenda of previous governments has become an important institutional catalyst for that. This paper analyzes the case of the School of Government and Public Management of the University of Chile using one three-dimension and other seven-subdimension models. Evidence shows a group of traits and emphasis that have to be considered in designing a curriculum to form public managers suitable for modernization of public management. This information is gathered from the application and analysis of four focus groups with key actors along with the analysis of official documents. This paper identifies, describes and explains the variables to be considered in a formative process aimed at public managers."

These shared elements could be described as a common epistemological gesture, the overcome of a reductionist and dualist paradigm, instead giving away to a paradigm of complexity. In both perspectives, a phenomenological and close to experience philosophical reflection is incorporated, which can account the human experience as an irreducible and valid source of knowledge. In Varela’s theory, the notion of embodiment permit to conceive the mind as natural endowment of the body. In Contemporary psychoanalytic theories, nature of human experience is conceive as intrisically social, proposing a “two person” psychology and the intersubjective model. Finally, in line with both currents and in a preliminary way, I propose the notion of co-emergency, seeking to overcome different forms of dualisms like internal/external, subject/world, I/Other, etc. From a clinical perspective, co-emergency can be conceived a s the coupling of two subjectivities, as a particular experiential mode of being with others, intending to overcome dualism regarding transference and represented mental states."

HABs will likely intensify with rising eutrophication, ocean warming, acidification and climatic atmospheric and oceanographic oscillations (e.g., El Niño). During the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030), it is imperative to produce knowledge to predict HABs and mitigate their severe negative sustainability consequences. This review on coevolved symbiotic and antagonistic algae-bacteria interactions highlights the HAB holobiome, i.e., phycosphere-attached and free-living bacteria, as potential bioindicators of bloom onset and decline as they promote, inhibit or suppress algal growth. The reviewed literature led us to discuss (1) the conceptual issues and experimental approach required to generate and include the HAB holobiome data into monitoring schemes to evaluate the resulting predictive model, (2) the relevance of an integrated science-policy approach to articulate the holobiome knowledge among stakeholders, including policymakers, for the efficient use and adaptive management of ecosystem services, and 3) a way to translate, once validated, the holobiome-based predictive model into a widely adopted policy. In this sense, the ongoing Monitoring Algae in Chile project (MACH; www.mach-satreps.org/en/) provides a framework to articulate the holobiome science with policy to establish reliable forecast systems to minimize HAB impact on public health, aquaculture and fisheries activities. This Chilean-Japanese research collaboration builds on the lessons from the catastrophic HAB event on Chiloé Island (May 2016), where world-class salmon, mussel aquaculture, and artisanal fishers coexist."

A sample of 639 Chilean high school students between 14 and 17 years old was used. Through structural equation modelling (SEM),—as hypothesized—a statistically significant indirect effect was found between study–related positive emotions and academic performance via psychological capital. Students’ study–related positive emotions were related to better academic performance through positive relationships with their levels of psychological capital (i.e., efficacy, hope, optimism, and resilience). Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed, limitations are mentioned, and future research directions are proposed."

To develop the proposed argument, the case of the city of Valparaíso is taken, where there is evidence of a decrease informal access to this asset, expressed in an increase in informality and residential precariousness. This is accompanied by a greater exposure to natural hazards (i.e. fires, mass removals) that translate into risks, enhanced by the location conditions of the case under study. In this way, it is shown that those involved live in disadvantaged conditions with respect to other social groups, a situation that can be reversed neither by policies nor by planning. The foregoing becomes even more relevant within the framework of a constituent process such as the one Chilean society is experiencing."

However, a recent call has been made from postcolonial urban studies to open the understanding of the production of space from the Global South. Considering the above, an alternative theoretical-methodological proposal is presented, which could evidence the production of a space not recognized by the predominant categories used in the literature. In theoretical terms, differentiated spaces could be interpreted from the margin, understood as a space located outside a pre-existing totality; thus, allowing the production of new spatial forms. In terms of method, an analogical dialectical reasoning is proposed to identify the similarities and differences between the expansion space and the predominant categories used to interpret it. To achieve this, geographical space is studied from a perspective that integrates its physical and social dimensions. Finally, the methodology is presented taking as cases the city of Santiago, Chile and Morelia, Mexico."
681,6,"TITLE: From segregation to residential exclusion Where are the new poor households (2000-2017) in the city of Santiago, Chile? Desde la segregación a la exclusión residencial ¿Dónde están los nuevos hogares pobres (2000-2017) de la ciudad de Santiago, Chile? | KEYWORDS: Housing policy; Residential segregation; Social exclusion; Territorial inequalities; Urban poverty | ABSTRACT: The subsidized social housing policy, widely applied during the 1990s in Santiago de Chile, formed a highly segregated popular periphery. Since 2000, the application of this instrument has decreased, which is interpreted as a movement of expulsion from social housing to the peri-urban area of the city. In this framework, this work analyzes the location of social housing built between 2000 and 2017 in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, to identify patterns of expulsion, displacement, and/or segregation of the beneficiaries of this policy. Through a mixed strategy that combined analysis of secondary information, photointerpretation of satellite images, and interviews with the director of municipal works of peri-urban distrits, we conclude that: 1) there is no evidence of a process of massive displacement of households in social housing towards the peri-urban of the city after the 1990s, and 2) the production of social housing, both in the city of Santiago and in its peri-urban, is lower than the new housing requirements, increasing the housing deficit. It is concluded that the current scenario is one of exclusion of the new poor households from the Santiago housing market, rather than of displacement or increase in residential segregation."

This does not refer to the direct experience of crime, but to various factors that unfold on the street, neighborhood and city scale, hiding behind it various fears and concerns. A less explored aspect refers to how this feeling is embedded in urban processes and transformations. Based on a qualitative study carried out in the Maipú district in Santiago de Chile, we investigated the judgments and assessments associated with danger and crime and how these are related to socio-spatial changes. Our thesis is that the perception of insecurity overturns the traditional imagery of a residential middle-class commune, which, after a process of demographic growth and changes in its urban structures, mobilizes new ways of signifying the environment in which it resides. In the neighborhoods, the figure of “empeligrosamiento” towards strangers emerges, a process of subjectivation that redefines social interactions that are not predictable. This process does not occur homogeneously in the territory, but is mediated by the type of neighborhood in which it resides."

However, both (i) the development of gated communities that have transformed Latin-American peripheries, as well as (ii) the emergence of new forms of urbanization in urban expansion areas, generate a diversification of segregation experiences among low income households. This article presents a comparison of the experience of segregation among those households living in social housing in the compact periphery, and those living in urban expansion areas. Based on a mixed methods research focused on three Chilean cities, findings confirm differences in (i) access to local services and infrastructure, (ii) perception of security, and (iii) territorial identities. In consequence, segregation is lived differently both in objective or material terms, and in symbolic and territorial stigma terms. We conclude discussing the applicability of the term “segregations” (in plural) and multiple territorial identities to address this phenomenon."

Although displacing the original residents is not part of their business strategy, in the long term, gentrification leads to social exclusion. New home purchasers do not seek the displacement of the original residents either. Using interviews with developers, a real estate project register and a residents' survey, this text studies the gentrification strategies used by promoters, focusing on the role played by spatial proximity between social groups and the displacement of residents in these business strategies.

Therefore, the present study seeks to investigate how the inclusion of a reflective component within the laboratory assessment contributes to promoting metacognition, self-regulation and self-assessment in science prospectives teachers. Methodology: The research is qualitative. It comprises an exploratory-descriptive scope and a Case Study design. The responses of 47 students in the assessments of 3 laboratories within the subject of General Chemistry were analyzed. An appreciation scale is applied to a subsample to determine their perception in relation with the applied pedagogical device. Results: The pupils showed an evolution in their information processing capacity and self-assessment throughout the laboratories. Discussion: This assessment innovation was effective in terms of promoting deeper and more meaningful learning, as well as developing metacognitive and self-regulatory students skills. Positive perceptions by the students, support the usefulness of this approach in chemical literacy. Conclusion: The assessment innovation contributed to improving academic performance, encouraged reflection and promoted more significant learning from the participants."

This article examines the role of youth wings within political parties; youth wing members assess the role that their organisations play in promoting youth political representation in their mother parties. Empirically, it draws on 58 semi-structured interviews with high-ranking Portuguese youth party members, comparing the perspectives in parties with and without autonomous youth wings. It assesses the role of youth wings in shaping parties' policy platforms (substantive representation); in promoting young candidates for public office (descriptive representation); and in mobilising youth to political participation. Overall, youth wings emerge as a double-edged sword. While they ensure youth representation in party bodies, they also often lead to their de facto internal segregation. In this context, youth wings' ability to influence internally, both in terms of policy and candidate selection, hinges on informal networks and negotiations with mother party leaders. Youth wings are also perceived as not being effective in mobilising youth to parties, with those who join youth wings expressing more office-seeking goals than those who join parties without these structures."

The results indicate an iceberg-shaped political recruitment ladder, with a stark compression of youth wing representation in the visible steps of candidates and MPs. More youth wing candidates are included in party lists as district magnitude increases, and there is evidence of an apprenticeship effect, with most youth wing candidates who are reselected able to improve their list position. More importantly, informal mechanisms and negotiations between youth wings and the mother party leadership emerge as a central factor in the ability of youth wings to influence candidate lists."

Compreender as raízes: atitudes populistas e traços de personalidade em Portugal. | KEYWORDS: Party identification; Personality traits; Populism; Portugal | ABSTRACT: The study of populism in Portugal has mostly been focused on the supply side, disregarding, to a large extent, the analysis of individual support for populism. This study analyses the relationship between populist attitudes and citizens’ personality traits through the lens of the Big Five Personality Traits model. Our findings underscore the substantial explanatory power of personality traits in understanding not only the prevalence and manifestation of populist attitudes, even when controlling for political efficacy, but also party identification and sociodemographic characteristics. The article concludes that conscientious individuals, especially those who gravitate towards populist parties, are more likely to support stricter regulations, adhere closely to social norms, and align themselves with populist messages out of fear of declining social status and a desire for control to bolster their sense of security."

While conventional narrative has posited that local networks are optimal for addressing a range of policy problems, and enhancing democratic participation, scarce attention has been devoted to understanding their inner working. A relevant gap in the literature pertains to the impact of central government intervention in igniting such arrangements on the diversity of actors, the intensity of interactions among actors, or their coordination practices. Such assessment is particularly relevant in centralized contexts. This article seeks to map and characterize the inner working of local networks in such a context—Portugal. The empirical analysis highlights the crucial role of central government in igniting local networks and in ensuring higher levels of formal intensity of collaboration to reduce transaction costs. Keeping such arrangements under the radar of central government, however, may curtail the diversity of actors, policy areas, and curb stakeholders’ commitment in local governance arrangements."

This article depicts how the pandemic crisis erupted in Portugal and how the Socialist government, the opposition and, to an important degree, the head of state responded to its demands, curbing the initial spread of the infection. The government ensured considerable levels of support from citizens and from other parties. The official opposition maintained its pragmatic and conciliatory tone during the confinement stages of the pandemic. It is argued that lower levels of political polarisation and a climate of cross-party collaboration are key factors in understanding the ‘Portuguese miracle’."

It seeks to assess the social, political and demographic variables that can explain variance. It demonstrates that coherence positively impacts the effectiveness and coordination of local networks, which are also propelled by personal and institutional trust among local stakeholders. Furthermore, the chapter highlights that coherence is by no means immutable. Instead, such arrangements cannot easily be established once and endure over extended periods unless the actors involved take action to maintain coherence over time."
697,-1,"TITLE: A fistful of followers: the resilience of the second-order campaign model? | KEYWORDS: European elections; political parties; second-order model; social media | ABSTRACT: EP elections are widely regarded as the archetypal second-order national election. Although parties’ strategic moves are frequently mediated by traditional media, parties are increasingly using alternative communication strategies, as social media, to communicate directly to their electorate. Social media can be particularly relevant in ‘bridging the gap’ with voters in second-order elections. After 2014, EP elections took place in a context where policy had been, to a non-negligible extent, perceived to have been shaped at the European level. The extent to which Eurozone crisis ‘disrupted’ the second-order model requires further examination. Through the analysis of the activities of political parties in social media, this study seeks to assess the extent to which the Eurozone crisis triggered more intense campaigns while assessing the partisan variables that explain variation in parties’ levels of activities. Overall, social media activity tends to suggest the resilience of the second-order model. This article highlights that the economic downturn has very much forced European issues into the political agendas, unveiling important signs of a disruption of the second-order model. Also, the politicisation of Europe in the first elections after the Eurozone crises (2019) was characterised by higher levels of activities of parties that openly contested the EU."

These were selected taking into account their importance within the national context, also covering important functional areas of responsibility. Beyond providing a description of their general framework and mandate, membership, and structure, each of the networks is assessed accordingly to the suggested typology in this volume. The country’s stable administrative and territorial organization, together with its centralized character, would lead to expect low levels of variance among these networks. Despite this context, network-related structures have made their way within this potentially unfavorable scenario, with different degrees of autonomy, coherence, and relevance. This chapter presents evidence of delegated, self-reflective, and independent networks."
700,1,"TITLE: The office is not enough: Women’s representation in high profile offices | KEYWORDS: Decision-making; Ministerial private offices; Political advisers, gender; Women’s political representation | ABSTRACT: Despite considerable efforts to accelerate gender equality in key political and public decision-making positions, progress has been slow and uneven. Studies on women’s political representation (WPR) have privileged descriptive representation – be it in elected legislatures, political parties or executive office. Concerning the latter, research has focused the prestige of ministries women occupy and whether they are relegated to ‘feminine’ policy areas. However, other venues for representation are equally relevant in political decision-making as ministerial private offices (MPO) and, specifically, who is and is not part of their politically appointed staff. Extant research has shown that the presence of women in Portuguese parliament and executive office has grown steadily, but their inclusion, role and level of influence among political appointees is still to be explored. Grounded on the feminist institutional approach, this article examines WPR in high-profile offices by focusing on political appointees. Firstly, it considers the gender composition of MPO, and secondly, the hierarchies in office and among ministries. The analysis is based on publicly available data on appointed staff, since 2011, encompassing three general elections resulting and the formation of three governments. Our results suggest that, in the Portuguese case, MPO are indeed gendered institutions, featuring clear traits of vertical and horizontal gender segregation and showing that women’s noticeable presence in MPO is clearly not enough as this is not equated with equal status and equal resources."
701,-1,"TITLE: Explaining perceptions of autonomy in the last chain of delegation | KEYWORDS: Autonomy; bureaucracy; bureaucratic capacity; civil servants; delegation processes; political control | ABSTRACT: This article explores the impact of consolidated principles of delegation on top civil servants’ perceptions of autonomy in management and policy-making processes across European parliamentary democracies. Particular attention is devoted to the extent to which bureaucratic capacity can be equated as a principle of delegation, considering the lenses and perspectives of bureaucrats instead of relying on politicians’ formal mechanisms to control bureaucratic activities. Empirically, this article is based on a large-scale study survey of senior public executives applied in eight European countries. While consolidated principles of delegation seem to be able to explain perceptions of autonomy across parliamentary democracies, results also suggest the importance of including bureaucratic capacity as a predictor of autonomy in the last chain of delegation. This emerges as one of the strongest explanatory variables of perceptions of managerial autonomy, regardless of the hierarchical position of respondents. However, it does not impact on bureaucrats’ perception of policy autonomy, as respondents’ position within the administrative state and the distinct traits of national public bureaucracies in Europe have a greater impact on the delegation of authority."
702,16,"TITLE: In the Shadow of the ‘Government of the Left’: The 2019 Legislative Elections in Portugal | KEYWORDS: contract parliamentarism; left-wing cooperation; party system; political parties; Portugal; post-bailout; radical left; social democracy | ABSTRACT: This article examines the Portuguese 2019 legislative election, which took place after a period of unprecedented and unexpected cooperation of the pro-European centre left and eurosceptic radical left. Initially dismissed as a ‘contraption’, this alliance belied the initial expectations and increasingly became a reference for South European social democratic parties. Yet, despite a seemingly reinforced popular mandate, it was not maintained after the 2019 election. We identify three factors for this. First, we suggest that the 2015–19 ‘contraption’ was a case of weak contract parliamentarism, making it easier not to renew. Second, the electoral victory of the Socialist Party made deals between the left-wing parties less necessary. Third, enduring programmatic differences between those parties hindered cooperation. Finally, it should be noted that the ‘contraption’ impacted interparty relations on the left and the expansion in the number of parliamentary parties in 2019, notably on the right."
703,13,"TITLE: The good, the bad and the ugly: Three faces of social media usage by local governments | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This article explores the determinants of local governments' use of social networking sites. It does so by analysing the relative impact of institutional, political and social determinants, while controlling for the impact of mayors' traits and social characteristics of municipalities on local governments levels of activity on Facebook. Empirically, this article presents a within-case analysis of Portuguese municipalities' activity on social media, aiming to shed light on the strategic use of social media by local governments. A coherent picture associated with politically pro-active local governments emerges from the results: higher levels of social media activity appear in municipalities with more competitive local elections and higher commitment to transparency. Moreover, findings suggest that local governments tend to be concerned with the low levels of voter turnout, potentially resorting to social media as a powerful tool to increase civic engagement and (offline) political participation. Levels of Facebook activity are significantly higher in larger and wealthier municipalities. The results indicate that Facebook official pages of municipalities are part of a larger arsenal of tools to promote political engagement and activity levels signal a propensity to involve citizens pro-actively."
704,16,"TITLE: The Biggest Loser? Local Public Services Under Austerity Measures in Portugal | KEYWORDS: Blame avoidance; Financial retrenchment; Fiscal consolidation; Memorandum of understanding; Portugal; Recentralization | ABSTRACT: The problems of national debt and the restrictive adjustment programmes severely undermined Portuguese local governments’ achievements of previous decades. Even though Portuguese public debt problems were not primarily driven by subnational authorities’ indebtedness, political discourse often stressed that municipalities’ debt was unmanageable, as a strategy to enhance public and political acceptance of severe measures. This chapter seeks to identify and analyse the implementation of specific measures and to test the impact of austerity on local public services. It is argued that three main threads of reform transformed Portuguese local government into the biggest loser of the austerity narrative: the financial retrenchment, the organization of the territory and the reduction of local government enterprises. While these reforms affected the provision of local public services, the tight schedule for the implementation of reforms reduced the possibility of engaging with citizens and local representatives, reducing an important source of legitimacy of local government."
705,16,"TITLE: Intermunicipal cooperation: The quest for governance capacity? | KEYWORDS: Governance capacity; intermunicipal cooperation; Portugal; regional dynamics | ABSTRACT: Intermunicipal cooperation is being increasingly adopted in various countries to cope with the dilemmas of territorial scale and resource rationing. Despite the pressures towards the reshaping of administrative boundaries, little is known about the capacity of intermunicipal associations to function as effective, legitimate and resilient policy actors. This article aims to contribute to this debate by addressing two interrelated dimensions. First, it seeks to present a conceptual definition of governance capacity, unpacking the conceptual framework into dimensions that can be measured systematically. Second, it aims to empirically assess the governance capacity of Portuguese intermunicipal associations, drawing on a unique survey of intermunicipal associations. Overall, results suggest that despite being instrumentally driven, intermunicipal associations have proven to be efficient, with members recognizing the benefits and the spillover effects of trustworthy arrangements. However, the path dependencies affecting Portuguese local governments may impact on the relatively low levels of governance capacity. Points for practitioners: This article undertakes a conceptual analysis of the governance capacity of intermunicipal associations. This analytical framework can be crucial for leaders, practitioners and professionals working in management and administration especially those working in complex and demanding settings. Given the general trend towards intermunicipal cooperation – strongly encouraged by national and European regulations and reforms – practitioners need to be able to measure the capacity of the cooperative arrangements to be established and to be maintained. This article also strives to enlighten those professionals as to which dimensions mostly need to be strengthened so as to allow intelligent collective choices to be made and to set strategic directions for the allocation of (increasingly) scarce resources."
706,-1,"TITLE: The million-dollar question: can internships boost employment? | KEYWORDS: first cycle degrees; graduate employment; higher education; internships; Portugal; work integrated learning | ABSTRACT: Higher education institutions are increasingly concerned with the professional insertion of graduates in the labour market and with the design of institutional mechanisms to facilitate students’ transition from higher education to work, particularly given the context of scarcity of financial resources and the rise of graduate unemployment. This issue has been addressed, inter alia, through the creation of study programmes with internships. Despite the public discourse encouraging the use of such strategies, there is a general consensus regarding the absence of empirical studies on the professional value of these strategies. This article aims to assess two interrelated questions: the extent to which measures of graduate unemployment rate tend to decrease after the introduction of internships in Portuguese study programmes; and the extent to which this effect applies to the different institutions that comprise the Portuguese tertiary education landscape. It also seeks to contribute to the debate on the relevance of the structure and nature of internships, which are factors frequently neglected in the literature."
707,16,"TITLE: Striving for Local Governance Capacity in Portugal and Spain | KEYWORDS: Catalonian Case; Governance Capacity; Inter-municipal Cooperation; Member Municipalities; Portuguese Case | ABSTRACT: Despite the well-known differences regarding the level of devolution in Portugal and Spain, inter-municipal associations (IMAs) emerged as a relevant piece of the institutional systems. The strategies to foster these bodies, however, have been different. While Portugal opted to promote them very clearly, on the verge of employing a top-down logic, Spanish authorities are trying to control IMAs and even reduce their number. Despite the different scenarios, both countries are striving to ensure the governance capacity of inter-municipal collaborative endeavours, struggling for the emergency of a new political actor able to function effectively. This chapter seeks to present an index of governance capacity and measure the performance of both countries across the different dimensions of the index."
708,16,"TITLE: Patterns of Ministerial Recruitment, Partisanship and Financial Crisis | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The appointment of non-partisan ministers has been equated as a symptom of the waning of the party government, a pattern particularly noticeable in newer, Southern European crisis-prone democracies. Systematic empirical evidence on the impact of the eurozone crisis is, however, still required. This chapter seeks to characterize patterns of ministerial recruitment in Portugal before, during and after the 2011-2013 eurozone crisis. Using data on ministerial profiles from 1999 to 2022, the chapter demonstrates how parties in government face strong incentives to maintain control over the selection of ministers. The pivotal role of parties is clearly visible in the recruitment of partisan ministers that tends to revolve around individuals coming from the national structures of the governing parties and who occupy core ministerial positions in government. Moreover, ministers with no party affiliation tend to gravitate towards the orbit of a particular party, further reinforcing the salience of a partisan aura. Finally, while non-partisanship may be a remarkable feature of Portuguese governments, it was not salient during the eurozone crisis period, being instead concentrated around critical portfolios for external credibility and technical negotiations with external officials."
709,16,"TITLE: Political advisers in Portugal: Partisanship and loyalty in policy processes | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This article aims to contribute to the current debate regarding the role of political advisers in Portugal. It does so by empirically analysing appointments to positions within ministers’ private offices, specifying when and why such advice is sought and accepted by ministers. Multivariate analysis is complemented with elite perspectives on the roles of ministerial advisers. Results suggest that parties in government appoint political advisers to ministers’ private offices as a strategy to legitimize policy choices and instruments, by injecting partisanship, responsiveness and loyalty in the policy-making process. Politicizing these positions is also a valuable asset for politicians given the procedural-oriented, and the inter-sector and inter-service coordination problems within a heavy administrative structure, such as the Portuguese one. The use of this mechanism depends on the capacity of opposition parties to constrain incumbents’ control over such appointments."
710,-1,"TITLE: Stairway to employment? Internships in higher education | KEYWORDS: Employment; First-cycle degrees; Graduate employability; Higher education; Internships; Portugal | ABSTRACT: This article aims to shed light on the current debate regarding the role of internships in higher education in graduates’ employability. In specific, it analyses empirical data on a large-scale study of Portuguese first-cycle study programmes, in order to explore indicators of the professional value of internships in the employability of higher education graduates. Results demonstrate that study programmes that include internships tend to significantly enhance graduates’ employability, particularly within the universe of polytechnic and public higher education institutions. Besides the instrumental value of internships, the impact of the nature and structure of the internship on the percentage of unemployed graduates are also discussed. Mandatory internships and the inclusion of multiple, shorter internships throughout the degree are negatively associated with unemployment levels. Results indicate work-based learning can be used as a successful strategy to bridge theoretical knowledge and practice and enhance graduate employability. These findings provide important insights for the evaluation and/or the design of internship programmes in higher education."
711,16,"TITLE: The many faces of (party) appointments: Party government and patronage in Portugal, 1995-2009 | KEYWORDS: civil service; party government; patronage; Portugal | ABSTRACT: In recent years there has been a renewed interest in the political recruitment to non-elective public offices of the state. Such appointments can help entrench party organizations, cementing their position within the state and can also emerge as an instrument to provide parties with leverage over (and crucial information within) the increasingly fragmented and delegated processes of policymaking. Portugal has been conceived as a country with appointments deep into the administrative hierarchy, mainly motivated by partisan considerations. These accounts overlook the different rationales for patronage. This article aims to re-examine accounts on the (many) faces of patronage, by empirically exploring the logics of recruitment on three inter-related dimensions. First, to what extent different hierarchical levels are associated to different patronage functions. Second, by analysing the extent to which different moments of the governing period are associated to different faces of patronage. Third, by assessing the impact of party competition on patterns and logics of recruitment to the civil service."
712,16,"TITLE: Paving the (Hard) Way for Regional Partnerships: Evidence from Portugal | KEYWORDS: European structural funds; higher education institutions; interinstitutional partnerships; Local government; regional development | ABSTRACT: A fundamental dilemma which troubles advocates of interinstitutional partnerships in regional development pertains to the extent to which partnerships enhance the effectiveness of governance processes and outcomes. This dilemma is particularly relevant in contexts that lack strong cohesive regional development alliances, such as the Portuguese case. This article aims to shed light on the debate regarding the role of partnerships in regional development, drawing on a unique collaborative interinstitutional partnership. It explores the responses to complexity across the different stakeholders, as well as its effects at the formulation and implementation stages of the strategic plans devised to apply for EU funding. Findings suggest that interinstitutional partnerships induce significantly different allocative choices at the agenda-setting. However, the established partnership was unable to cope with the several obstacles that emerged during the implementation, suggesting several vulnerabilities of partnerships, which are explored. Findings suggest the need to reinforce governance mechanisms during the implementation stage."
713,16,"TITLE: Patronage and party government in Portugal Serviço ao poder ou o poder ao serviço? Patrocinato e governos partidários em Portugal | KEYWORDS: Elite interviews; Party government; Patronage; Public administration | ABSTRACT: Patronage has been interpreted as an important dimension of the party government model. However, patronage has been conventionally associated with the distribution of jobs in public administration aiming to reward services rendered to the party in government. This is not entirely satisfactory. The growing complexity of governance processes, together with the growing influence of the upper echelons of the civil service in policy making has prompted politicians to search for new ways of controlling the bureaucracy. Through the use of elite interviews, this article seeks to analyze the emergence of an instrumental dimension of patronage, as a potential key resource for parties in government to control the policy-making process and retain a role in modern democratic governance."

715,16,"TITLE: Party Patronage in Portugal: Treading in Shallow Water | KEYWORDS: Bureaucracy; Democratization; Party patronage; Party system dynamics; Political parties; Portugal | ABSTRACT: This chapter analyses patronage in contemporary Portugal. First, it provides a precise conceptualization of patronage and, second, bases its assessment on a detailed empirical basis which makes it comparable to the other cases analysed in this book. Third, and related, this chapter further specifies the dependent variable of patronage. The departure point is a neo-institutional one, that the nature of patronage in Portugal is unlikely to remain unaffected by changes in the country's institutional context. As such, it assesses not only the practice of patronage but also its scope, logic, and style, in order to better understand how democratization, the evolving nature of the Portuguese state and bureaucracy, as well as its parties and party system dynamics, have potentially impacted on the nature of patronage in Portugal."

We find evidence of a relationship between parties and organized civil society - albeit an instrumental one, largely based on reward-motivated linkages. The analysis of state grants indicates that parties act as brokers between the state and civil society groups, instrumentally using patronage resources. Three distinct dimensions of party influence on funding emerge. The first pertains to party organization: our evidence is consistent with the use of state funding to shore up party organizations and compensate for weak social roots. Second, electoral gains: funding is particularly visible around election periods, with legislative elections significantly more relevant than others. Third, the potential role of ideology: the ideological position of governing parties is also a significant predictor of civil society funding. © The Author(s) 2012."

This article focuses on the approach to this issue by the Dominican Francisco de Vitoria, the Licenciado Francisco Falcón and the jurist Juan de Solórzano Pereira. Their argument, grounded on the Aristotelian claim that things that are just by nature are subject to change, states that, even if unlawfully acquired, the abandon of the Indies would certainly bring about more damage than benefits to the natives. Thus, the potential duty to restitute the conquered lands would either cease or, at least, be suspended while the situation remains the same."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all births in the public hospital of Temuco, a medium-sized city in Southern Chile between 2009 and 2016 (n = 17,237). Information on adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, as well as spatial and maternal characteristics (insurance type, employment, smoking, age, and overweight/obesity), was collected from medical charts. Home addresses were geocoded and assigned to neighborhood. We tested whether births and prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes changed over time, whether birth events were spatially clustered (Moran’s I statistic), and whether neighborhood deprivation was correlated to outcomes (Spearman’s rho). We observed decreases in eclampsia, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and small for gestational age, while gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birth weight increased over the study period (all p < 0.01 for trend), with little changes after adjusting for maternal characteristics. We observed neighborhood clusters for birth rate, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Neighborhood deprivation was negatively correlated with low birth weight and preterm birth, but not correlated with eclampsia, preeclampsia, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, small for gestational age, gestational diabetes, nor stillbirth. Several encouraging downward trends and some increases in adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, which, overall, were not explained by changes in maternal characteristics were observed. Identified clusters of higher adverse birth outcomes may be used to evaluate preventive health coverage in this setting."

In turn, the perceived importance of environmental sustainability within higher education is growing at a rapid rate. This paper provides a summary of key elements as they apply to dentistry, and provides an introduction to the reader of an early consensus of how sustainability could be included as part of the dental curriculum. Methods: The consensus opinion within this paper largely centres around discussion at the ADEE sustainability workshop at the annual conference in Berlin (August 2019). In order to help inform discussions at the workshop, a brief scoping questionnaire was circulated to potential participants regarding their understanding and current teaching practices in sustainability. An infographic was designed to help delegates remember the important elements of sustainable dentistry. Delegates discussed the concept of sustainability alongside the infographic, and how they could link these with the Graduating European Dentist (GED) curriculum. Results: The discussions within the workshop largely centred around 4 main themes: Disease prevention and health promotion, Patient education and empowerment, Lean service delivery and Preferential use of strategies with lower environmental impact. Discussion: It is apparent that there is a widespread need for teaching materials relating to environmental sustainability; this includes specific learning outcomes relating to the 4 educational domains of the Graduating European Dentist curriculum, and methods for teaching and assessing these outcomes. Conclusion: This paper reports consensus on the first phase of a pan-European working group on Sustainability in dental education."

Usually, drinking water contains fluor to reduce caries incidence. In 90s, Chile started a debate about the legitimation of the utilization of drinking water fluoride in whole population and the effects that fluor has on the body, creating a polemic about this policy. The goal of this paper is to explore the controversy between the use of fluoridate drinking water for reducing caries like public health policy, from the point of view of Actor-Network theory. Experts and people of community do not agree about the effectiveness of this measure because of the lack of permission of consumer or the potential negative effects in the human health."

Methodology: quantitative research, with an explanatory and cross-sectional design. 290 nurses were enrolled in three hospitals in Chile. They were applied: questionnaire of socio-labour antecedents; the Karen Personal instrument to evaluate the Quality of Care and a questionnaire on Working Conditions. Main results: The existence of a favourable social environment, an adequate adjustment of the organization to the person and the adaptation of the person to the organization determine the perception of a higher Quality Nursing Care. Main conclusion: A greater appreciation of working conditions (favourable social environment, adequate adjustment of the organization to the person and adaptation of the person to the organization) increases the perception of the quality of care provided by nurses."

725,22,"TITLE: Pain compliance, disability, and state accountability: Lessons from Chile and Colombia on the form and function of less lethal weapons | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The design and deployment of less-lethal weapons (LLWs) derives from the technical principle of pain compliance, whereby situations (mainly protests, demonstrations, and evictions) that do not warrant the use of conventional firearms are instead controlled by inflicting 'minor' injuries or discomfort to temporarily incapacitate individuals. Focussing on ocular trauma caused by kinetic impact projectiles during social upheavals in Chile and Colombia as an entry point, this chapter problematises this principle from the perspectives of criminology and disability studies. We argue that in avoiding lethality, the design of LLWs neglects to address their capacity for producing impairments and potential uses in torture. For this reason, in addition to their patterns of deployment in policing and inpatient settings, a disability justice perspective is needed for assessing these weapons, as they can exacerbate the exclusion of disabled people. We end by providing recommendations for practice and further research avenues resulting from our initial provocations on LLW, policing, and disability."

To better understand this aspect of the sentencing process, this article examines data from interviews with, and observations of, 16 Sheriffs in 14 different Scottish Sheriff Courts. The accused persons’ backgrounds were indeed considered during the sentencing process. However, how Sheriffs constructed their role as sentencers seemed to directly affect how they acknowledged and took them into account."
727,22,"TITLE: Pre-trial detention in Chile: Between Time Management and Standardization Prisión Preventiva en Chile: Presión de la Gestión del Tiempo y Estandarización | KEYWORDS: Bureaucratization; Judicial practices; Pre-trial detention; Time management | ABSTRACT: The use of pre-trial detention in Chile is widely debated. Chilean legal scholars, for the most part, have advocated a restrictive interpretation. Despite this, empirical research studies on the use of pre-trial detention in Chile has revealed an increase in its use during the last decade and the development of standardized working strategies in judicial decision-making in this institution. To date, we lack in-depth analysis of the practice of this standardization and its specific relationship to pre-trial detention decisions. Based on non-participant observation of hearings and interviews with judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys in courts in the Araucanía and Bio-Bio regions, this article presents an empirical analysis of the application of pre-trial detention in Chile. In particular, how does the standardization of judicial practices influence the way decisions on pre-trial detention are made in Chile?The research study focused on the bureaucratic management of time from a socio-legal perspective. It finds that, in the face of time pressures, courts have adopted specific strategies to organize hearings, generating different types of hearings, each with its own speed and logic of standardization. The article emphasizes the need for a detailed and empirical exploration of the processes of bureaucratization within the judicial system and the tangible impacts these processes have on the fairness of access to justice."

730,6,"TITLE: Incremental housing as care infrastructure: transformations in low-income housing in Alto Hospicio, Chile | KEYWORDS: care infrastructure; care relations; Chile; housing transformation; Incremental housing | ABSTRACT: The discussion regarding the relationship between housing and care within the general field of housing studies has generated a broadening of the field in many ways. One of such is the reciprocal relationship between the numerous forms of housing transformation and care, particularly for low-income communities in the Global South. We suggest that the main drive to transform housing incrementally is care. Following the work of Power and Mee (2019), we consider housing as an infrastructure of care and therefore, the incremental transformation of housing as part of a set of practices, which produce a sociomaterial assemblage that is constitutive of care. Under these practices, not only does housing pattern care relations, but care relations also pattern housing and therefore housing transformations. This relational way of seeing housing and care is increasingly relevant in the implementation of housing transformation programmes and policies, as this would impact incremental housing design, programme, operation, funding, and implementations, particularly in the context of an increasing incorporation of multiple alternatives of housing transformation and improvement in public housing in the Global South. We show this through ethnographic work on housing transformation for care purposes in the city of Alto Hospicio, Chile."
731,3,"TITLE: Relearning to travel in Santiago: The importance of mobile place-making and travelling know-how | KEYWORDS: Mobile place-making; Place; Santiago de Chile; Social practices; Urban daily mobility | ABSTRACT: Cities today are experiencing constant, significant and abrupt infrastructural and spatial transformations. This is particularly evident in Metropolitan cities and more specifically, in cities in the Global South. Over the last decade, the implementation of Transantiago-a new public transport system-created greater awareness about the relevance of mobility practices in everyday life in the city. The intervention generated general unrest and particular daily challenges to Santiago’s residents requiring them to suddenly adapt, relearn and create ways of making sense of the complex situation that took place. It also generated major challenges for Transantiago implementers, who had to quickly react to the importance of everyday mobility experiences. Based on ethnographic research on mobility practices in Santiago de Chile prior and after Transantiago, this article presents the idea of mobile place-making as well as the various strategies urban travellers develop to adapt and create new ways of making sense of the city on a daily basis as it transforms. The results explore how travellers creatively find ways of learning or relearning to use new mobile spaces based on a travelling know-how which thickens the more mobility is practised, thus providing new possibilities within these places on the move."

However, in its conception, the idea of the passage of time has been left behind, focusing basically on physical-spatial issues. This has defined and encapsulated human existence into spatial containers. However, looking at residential habitat from an inhabitant's experience, it is possible to unveil how its production emerges as a continuous process of place making, in time and space, understanding both as an inseparable unit called ""timespace"". This paper works with the trajectory and information gathering of the author's personal experience of timespace. The methodology encompasses autoethnography, using photographs as a means of memory extension that would allow capturing the becoming of the experience, and thus constructing a visual story that would be able to reveal it."

Using time-series analysis of satellite data to disentangle deforestation from other forest degradation causes | KEYWORDS: Deforestation; Remote sensing; Structural breaks; Temporal segmentation | ABSTRACT: Protecting natural ecosystems requires monitoring approaches that work as early warning systems to avoid degradation and protect biodiversity. However, separating forest disturbance causes in change-detection pipelines is challenging due to the complex interplay of multiple drivers affecting vegetation. This study aims to detect deforestation in highly heterogeneous ecosystems. We used Landsat NDVI time-series data for testing three unsupervised change detection methods: (1) the non-parametric phenological anomaly detection (npphen), (2) the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC), and (3) the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithms. We used visual interpretation of Google Earth Pro high-resolution data (<10 m) to depict deforestation, and natural-induced changes, like forest browning and fires, evaluating the performance of the unsupervised methods. Additionally, a Random Forest model trained with the outputs from detection algorithms together with elevation and radar vegetation index data were utilised to depict deforestation in a second step. While PELT slightly outperformed other methods for tracking general vegetation changes, with overall accuracies (OA) ranging from 0.78 to 0.99, depending on the vegetation type, it also showed the slowest deforestation tracking response. CCDC presented the fastest response and an OA between 0.78 and 0.95. Additionally, we observed a mean OA of only 0.47 when separating deforestation from other changes using only the unsupervised models. On the other hand, deforestation was accurately detected (OA = 0.93; kappa = 0.83) when using CCDC outputs within a secondary supervised classification, agreeing with selected citizen-based complaints from the Environmental Superintendence. The relatively fast response in deforestation tracking using CCDC makes it a viable alternative for near real-time monitoring. Commonly used unsupervised detection methods may be coupled with supervised techniques to depict vegetation change sources robustly. This application constitutes a step forward for managing and monitoring vegetation areas in highly complex and dynamic landscapes, like Mediterranean ecosystems."

Accurate crop mapping can help assist decision-making related to storage, marketing, and other production tasks. This study has designed robust crop classification models to classify two major crop types (cereals and canola) in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia. These models combined Sentinel 1 and 2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Three methods were applied to test classification quality: the holdout method, leave-one-season-out cross-validation (LOSOCV), and leave-one-cluster-out-cross-validation (LOCOCV). The holdout method evaluated the model's performance on data representing the entire population. The LOSOCV method was used to test the model's ability to extrapolate over time (unseen data from new seasons), and the LOCOCV method was used to test the ability to extrapolate over space (data from a new site). Crop type labelled data (n = 193 for cereals and n = 113 for canola) were extracted from high-resolution yield maps derived from grain yield monitors mounted on harvesters, and this was used to train and validate the classification models. The results showed that the holdout validation approach achieved the highest accuracy (overall and Kappa scores >0.98), but this might be caused by spatial autocorrelation of the sampling strategy implemented, which leads to an overoptimistic scenario. The overall accuracies and Kappa scores achieved from the LOSOCV method varied depending upon the difference in crop phenology from season to season, with overall accuracy ranging from 0.70 to 0.92 and Kappa scores from 0.61 to 0.90. The overall accuracies and Kappa scores for the LOCOCV ranged from 0.87 to 0.99 and 0.84 to 0.98, respectively. The gross primary productivity (GPP) and the chlorophyll red edge index (CIr) were the most important features across the three models. The outputs of this research can potentially complement models that require crop type information, such as carbon cycling and crop yield models."

Our aim is to contribute to the clarification of this important aspect of Chilean history, from the perspective of historical genetics. We first examine the variation of pan-American haplogroups of mitochondrial DNA (A, B, C and D) in five natural regions of continental Chile: Norte Grande (Far North), Norte Chico (Near North), Central Zone, Southern Zone and Southernmost Zone. When evaluating the distribution of men and women of American ancestral origin, the predominance of women over men is noticeable. In contrast, when the gender distribution of individuals of European ancestral origin is analyzed, male predominance is consistently observed. Next we calculated genetic distances between representatives of different ethnic groups of the southern cone of South America, the natural regions of Chile and mixed populations of Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Argentina. As expected, genetic distances indicate proximity between Quechua, Aymara, and Atacameño and the Norte Grande, and between Pehuenche, Mapuche, Huilliche, Tehuelche, Alacalufe, Yagan and Ona and the Southern and Southernmost Zone. In addition, displacements of groups and population mixing involving the Amazon, Central Andes and Argentina are revealed, contributing to a clearer understanding of the geographical origin of Chilean ethnic groups."

739,-1,"TITLE: On the underestimation of the significance of environmental impacts in Peru: an approach using homogeneous units | KEYWORDS: biophysical factors; indicators; SEIA; significance | ABSTRACT: This study examines the reliability of the Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) in Peru, focusing on projects predicted to have high negative impacts. It highlights the discrepancy between the expected and the estimated impacts in EISs, revealing a general trend of underestimating the environmental significance of projects, particularly in areas free from industrial activities. The study critiques the application of the Gomez Orea Method, originally successful under Spanish regulations but problematic in its Peruvian applications, as evidenced by inconsistencies in the methodologies and a lack of bibliographic and regulatory support for the indicators used. The analysis covers seven EISs involving hydroelectric and mineral exploitation projects. It identifies a recurrent pattern where despite the significant potential impacts of these projects on water quality, ecosystems, and biodiversity, the impacts are predominantly classified as ‘Compatible’ or low. This underestimation results in 97.37% of impacts being categorized as low, contradicting the projects’ initial high-risk classification. Moreover, the study compares the Gomez Orea Method with the Conesa Method, a more conservative approach, finding significant methodological differences affecting impact significance estimations. The study advocates for enhanced Environmental Impact Assessment practices in Peru, suggesting the adoption of more conservative assessment methods to accurately gauge and mitigate environmental impacts."

When looking for academic help, students may prefer specific partners based on their social goals regarding academic performance. Aims: Based on the social goals for wanting to achieve academically (e.g., studying to be with friends, increasing/maintaining their own social status), we examine the extent to which adolescents' selection of preferred academic partners (with whom they would like to study) is driven by peers' academic performance, prosocial behaviour and friendships. Moreover, as high-achieving students play an important role in academic settings, whether they are more likely to prefer to study with similar high-achieving peers and friends was examined. Sample: A total of 537 seventh-grade students from 13 classes over three waves. Methods: Longitudinal social network analyses (RSiena). Results: Adolescents were more likely to select high achievers, friends and prosocial peers as preferred academic partners. Furthermore, high achievers were more likely to choose other high achievers and friends as preferred academic partners. Conclusions: Adolescents are likely to prefer as study partners someone they can learn from and who is more approachable, cooperative and friendly. Regarding high achievers, they would choose not only academic partners with similar academic interests and motivations to help them boost their academic achievement but also classmates with whom they like to spend time and share personal issues."

In this study, we focus on the role of gender in shaping the careers of Chilean education researchers. Using survival, Poisson regression, and social network analyses, we examined gendered patterns of attrition, research output, first authorship, and coauthorship across researchers’ career trajectories. Bibliometric data were analyzed for the 5, 702 authors who published articles in Scopus-indexed education journals between 2011 and 2021 while affiliated with a Chilean institution. Our results show that, despite similar initial representation, being a female researcher increases attrition hazard by 21.5%, with women at the beginning of their research career being particularly at risk of attrition. We also found a significant gender gap in the number of articles published, with Chilean female education researchers publishing, on average, 20.8% fewer articles than male researchers, a disparity that increases in magnitude with years of research experience. However, there were no significant gender differences in research leadership (i.e., first authorships). In relation to collaboration profiles, female researchers showed significantly fewer coauthorships and were more likely to engage in national collaborations when compared to male researchers, who tended to develop more international (both regional and nonregional) collaboration profiles. Furthermore, coauthorship patterns showed significant levels of gender and research experience homophily. Possible explanations pertaining to structural barriers faced by female researchers and policy implications are discussed."

The present study investigates the patterns of advice-seeking ties in 10 Chilean public schools, and their predictors, using a mixed design that combines the analysis of social networks and interviews. It was found that patterns differ among schools and that the levels of collaboration observed are associated with the structural conditions perceived by educators (collegiality, leadership team support and time). In addition, educators seek support from few colleagues, and these links tend to be non-reciprocal, perceived as highly influential, and organized into hierarchical subgroups. Teachers without leadership positions are more active in seeking advice, but the same is not true for those with higher professional development needs. Those in leadership positions and with more years of experience in their school are more sought after by their colleagues. Educators of the same gender, similar age, and in the same positions, are more likely to hold ties among each other. Implications for policy include improving the value and structural conditions for collaboration, and promoting teacher retention, to maintain the social capital of schools."

By using bibliometric techniques, a systematic review, and a social network analysis, this review article provides an overview of the main patterns of publications in HE during its history. The findings show that (i) the volume of articles has been continuously increasing, with a particular marked uplift since 2007; (ii) while single-authored articles have dominated the publication pattern, collaborative articles have shown a particular growth over the last decade; (iii) the USA, the UK, and Australia have dominated the journal in terms of the number of articles, international collaboration, and the most prolific authors; (iv) while Chinese authors have become more evident, there has been a near-absence of contributions from Latin America, Eastern Europe, and most of Africa; (v) in the entire history of HE, there has been a gender imbalance (in favour of male authors) across the most cited articles, but this pattern has changed in the last decade and; (vi) both teaching and learning and system policy have been key research themes in the journal although internationalisation and the student experience have recently gained traction. These patterns of publication in HE, with their imbalances and absences, suggest several challenges ahead."

Individuals’ reports of their peers’ behaviors (dyadic perceptions) and the aggregated classmates’ reports (reputational perceptions) were disentangled. The findings indicated that adolescents were more likely to befriend classmates widely perceived as prosocial (reputational perception) and were less likely to befriend classmates they perceived as aggressive (dyadic perception). For popularity, the effect of dyadic perception disappeared when including the reputational perception. The findings highlight the differences between the dyadic and reputational perceptions of peer behavior. Not only dyadic perceptions of behaviors but also reputational perceptions exert a role in befriending peers."

Based on a systematic review and a coding process of 260 papers, the study analyzes academic collaboration at three levels: countries, institutions, and researchers. In each level, the degree of centrality, betweenness, and closeness of each actor are calculated, in addition to the density of the network and the visualization through network maps. The results show that collaboration patterns are relatively low at all levels, although they show variations. Thus, while international collaboration networks focus on countries from the Global North, showing low levels of collaboration with Latin America countries, in the case of institutions, collaboration tends to focus on those with greater prestige and tradition, although including increasingly broad and differentiated clusters. Finally, academic collaborations at the level of researchers present low density and a scarcity of connections, although the existence of key actors."

Friendships are especially important in this time period. The present study investigated friendship selection and influence (contagion) processes with regard to victimization, as well as prosocial and aggressive characteristics of victims’ friends. Using social network analyses (RSiena), we longitudinally analyzed data of five fourth-grade classrooms, including 185 students (56.8% girls; (Formula presented.) age at Time 1 = 10 years old). Results showed that early adolescents who experience peer victimization were not likely to select peers with similar levels of victimization as friends but selected prosocial peers as friends. Moreover, friends did not become more similar over time in their victimization levels. Prosocial students selected similar peers as friends. The discussion highlights the relevance of fostering positive peer relations for targeting victimization and discusses the defending role of friends in victimization situations."

This study addressed this issue for the Chilean national teacher evaluation system. Mathematics teachers (N = 51) from the 2 middle adjacent performance categories, and their students, were examined by videotaping classroom practice and coding the videos with the Classroom Assessment Scoring System for Secondary School, measuring students’ perceptions of their teachers’ practices and assessing student learning on standardized grade-level and unit-specific tests. Findings show that on almost all criterion variables, competent teachers outperformed basic teachers, but differences were usually small. Teachers evaluated as competent obtained consistently better results regarding their teaching practices, as assessed by trained observers, as well as based on reports by their own students. However, there was only weak indication of differences between the 2 groups in terms of student learning."

The sample was composed of 528 seventh to ninth graders (Mage = 15; 64.1% girls)from 12 classrooms (four in each category of ability grouping)across two waves in five schools in Chile. The effects of academic performance and school misconduct on receiving academic and friendship nominations were examined, as well as the interplay between academic and friendship relationships. Furthermore, the extent to which similarity in adolescents' academic performance and school misconduct contributed to the formation and maintenance of academic and friendship relationships was examined. Sex, socioeconomic status, and structural network features were also taken into account. Longitudinal social network analyses (RSiena)indicated that (1)in high-ability classrooms students chose high-achieving peers as academic partners; (2)in high-ability classrooms students avoided deviant peers (i.e., those high in school misconduct)as academic partners; and (3)academic relationships led to friendships, and vice versa, in both high- and low-ability classrooms. Whereas the interplay of friendship and academic relationships was similar in high- and low-ability classrooms, the formation and maintenance of academic networks unfolded differently in these two types of classrooms."

We used census achievement data that assessed the same cohort of students at the end of 8th and 10th grade. We applied multilevel modelling and calculated correlations between teachers’ value-added estimates and their results based on the evaluation system’s multiple measures of teaching quality, which include a portfolio of classroom teaching artefacts and a video-taped lesson, a peer interview, supervisor assessments and a self-assessment. Our study finds a medium-size positive relationship between value-added estimates in mathematics and teachers’ portfolio results, while relationships with the other instruments are weaker. Correlations are lower for Spanish, but showing a similar pattern across instruments. We also find significant yet weak relationships between value-added estimates and three of six emerging factors of teaching practice based on the evaluation’s portfolio data."

We first describe the modern conception of validity as a core aspect of quality of tests and testing systems, evolving around the proposed interpretations and uses of test scores: ""Validity refers to the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for proposed uses of tests. Validity is, therefore, the most fundamental consideration in developing tests and evaluating tests."" (AERA, APA & NCME, 2014, p. 11). In particular, we focus on the role that consequences have played in the literature on test validity and validation. We then introduce PISA and its intended interpretations and uses as the basis for examining its validity. This is followed by summarizing existing empirical studies on the uses and consequences of PISA. Finally, the paper presents missing pieces in the validity evidence related to consequences and discusses the importance of a pro-active agenda on these topics by the PISA stakeholders at international and national levels."

The present study suggests that in addition to resources, an individual's beliefs about economic distribution are an important determinant of participation both in elections and in protests. Based on the analysis of the Chilean data from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) 2012, the results suggest that distributive beliefs are associated primarily with participation in protests."

Economic, social, and political factors make difficult the preparation for ongoing and future impacts. Few studies have explored how people in this region perceive and respond to climate change. In this scenario, we conducted an online survey to address the following research question: How sociodemographic factors are influencing perceptions and emotional responses associated with climate change in LA countries? The final sample consisted of 7232 people, with an error of 2.8% for the total population from 18 countries, representing 67% of the region’s internet-accessible population. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, and mixed linear models. Results indicate a consensus on the fact that climate change is already happening, that is totally or partially caused by human activities, that will worsen poverty and inequalities but also that is an opportunity to build a fairer society. Sociodemographic differences were also found, showing the importance of sex, age and having or not having children in multiple variables. We hope this study will contribute to a better understanding of this complex social issue, informing policies to encourage a greater engagement with climate action."

In the present study, we investigate the association between frailty status and well-being (happiness and life satisfaction) among older adults, and we test the role of self-perceived health as potential mediator in such relations. We recruited 1205 older Chilean adults who responded to measures about their objective health status (frailtyrelated indicators), well-being, and self-perceived health. Overall, path analyses showed that frailty status is negatively associated to life satisfaction and happiness, and that self-perceived health works as a mediator for such relations. The social and psychological consequences of the frail syndrome in older adults are discussed."
754,-1,"TITLE: Openness, wage gaps and unions in Chile: A micro-econometric analysis | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter examines the relationship between wages and levels of trade and FDI openness in twenty-nine sectors of the Chilean economy. Over the last four decades, this country almost fully liberalised its trade and foreign direct investment, which accelerated growth of flows in both areas and contributed to important changes in the labour market. Using cluster analysis, we divide 29 sectors into three groups of high, medium and low levels of trade and foreign direct investment penetration in 2003 and 2008. Subsequently, an average wage equation is estimated for salaried workers in each group based on their characteristics (gender, education, work experience and union membership) using microdata of the Supplementary Income Survey (SIS) database. Differences between average wages of the three groups are decomposed with the Oaxaca-Blinder method. The results confirm that the group of most open sectors pays a ""wage premium"" to its workers. It is also shown that most of this premium is accounted for by higher levels of labour unionisation compared to other sectors. An alternative grouping of sectors into two categories of tradable and non-tradable sectors based on export intensity only yields similar results."

Preservice Teachers in a New Time and Space Dimension: Virtuality | KEYWORDS: higher education; interculturalism; Preservice teachers; talent management; teaching and learning strategies; virtuality | ABSTRACT: To apply effective teaching and learning strategies, it is essential to understand the complexity of human groups, especially in educational contexts. To look for the relationship between the contributions that people make, it is critical to understand the singularities of cultures when developing innovations and to foster leadership in education. This chapter presents an experience developed in Higher Education in Chile focused on the ability of preservice teachers to enhance the development of individual talents as an active teaching and learning strategy to create a society made up of integrally developed people in educational contexts. In addition, we use virtual learning environments as a vehicle to connect students between physical and virtual boundaries. This strategy is based on the Talent Management Model which was implemented in intercultural primary schools by professors and preservice teachers from the south of Chile. The virtuality dimension promoted the detection of individual traits of students and contributed to the development of a cultural identity. Additionally, it offered theoretical and practical knowledge that implied an innovation in the training of future teachers."

To ensure quality in graduate programs, accreditation is compulsory. The current article presents a model to improve the process of self-regulation. The main objective was to design a Model of Quality Assurance for Postgraduate Programs in order to constitute a theoretical, mathematical, and informatics reference that would optimize the processes of self-regulation, self-evaluation, and accreditation of master and doctorate programs from the Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción, Chile. This descriptive research is based on a mixed methods approach. The proposal was intended through theoretical and empirical references related to the accreditation systems. The analysis process was conducted with key informants, and the informatics instrument was created and validated through expert judgment. After the analysis, the model was optimized considering the expert's suggestions. As a result of the optimization process, a matrix of eight dimensions was obtained and it is available online in order to be used by the heads of postgraduate programs. Finally, a model with four main stages was achieved in order to install a self-regulation and a self-evaluated culture that leads to accreditation as evidence of the quality of postgraduate programs."

The core practices approach offers a relevant alternative, including the definition of focal teaching practices and pedagogies of practice to promote them. One such pedagogy consists of approximations, through which preservice teachers can try out practices in low-stakes settings. These pedagogies are usually time intensive and can require substantive course restructuring. This raises the question of whether teaching simulations can be productively used in less intensive settings, and how these are perceived by students. We present the results of a quasi-experimental study conducted with preservice secondary teachers in Germany. The study assesses a novel teaching simulation and compares it with an established video-based analysis learning setting. Both conditions were implemented as part of a university-based seminar accompanying a five-month field experience focused on fostering productive classroom dialogue. The research aim was to assess the new simulation where a preservice teacher was meant to practice conducting productive classroom dialogue, which was videoed and then analyzed collectively (n=180 students). We compared this setting with a video-based analysis of classroom dialogue (n=100 students). The research questions focus on students' learning perceptions and self-efficacy perceptions around dialogic teaching, which we addressed using pre-post surveys. Our main results show that preservice teachers in the simulation condition had significantly more positive perceptions of the learning setting, including reported knowledge gains and intention to apply. Meanwhile, both groups had equally high levels of self-efficacy regarding classroom dialogue from pre to post-test with no significant interaction effect in favor of the IG. We discuss the results, which offer support for the proposed intervention, considering previous research on learning to teach in a teaching practicum. The lack of changes in self-efficacy is addressed, considering limitations and aspects for further research."

This study investigated how 67 teachers across educational phases in six countries contextualised the T-SEDA inquiry toolkit to conduct classroom inquiries and develop new practices. Surveys and inquiry reports yielded insights into how practitioner agency was further developed, with implications for sustainability. Change was evident in self-reported enhanced awareness and understanding of dialogue and use of dialogic strategies. Increases in students’ dialogic participation and plans for dissemination to colleagues were reported."
759,0,"TITLE: An analysis of the forms of teacher-student dialogue that are most productive for learning | KEYWORDS: Classroom dialogue; concordance analysis; mixed methods; primary school; sociocultural discourse analysis; student participation | ABSTRACT: Dialogic approaches based on active student participation, open, respectful discussion, exploring and critiquing different perspectives are increasingly found to support student learning. However, the specific productive forms of teacher-student interaction have rarely been studied systematically. A recent large-scale project explored the relationship between dialogic forms of interaction and learning outcomes for students aged 10–11 in primary school classrooms in England. This follow-up study built on the dataset and outcomes of that study. The objective here was to generate insights into the forms of interaction observable within classes achieving higher and lower learning gains in English and mathematics. Sociocultural discourse analysis combined in-depth qualitative analysis with corpus linguistics methods. The specific forms of dialogue emerging in the earlier study as most productive for learning from turn-by-turn coding and whole-lesson ratings were analysed in more depth. The findings offer rich illustrations of how the productive features are manifested in authentic classroom practice. The outcomes contribute to our understanding of which specific forms of teacher-student dialogue support learning, and how teachers may actively promote these.

Outcomes of practitioner professional development in this area are inconsistent and often dependent on costly, external input. Our study aimed to understand whether and how practitioner-led inquiry may offer an alternative, sustainable and scalable way of developing dialogic practices, characterising effective organisational models. The Teacher Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA) resource pack was designed to support iterative cycles of practitioner inquiry based on systematic analysis of classroom dialogue and reflecting critically with peers, using customisable coding tools and templates. This open resource embeds research findings about dialogue forms that are productive for student learning. We report our design-based research comprising nested inquiry cycles involving 74 practitioners from early years to tertiary levels. Data were derived from surveys, inquiry reports and interviews. Participants successfully used and adapted the resources for their own goals, needs and diverse contexts across seven countries. The largely autonomous process was typically supported by local facilitators working with groups of practitioners; data analysis focused on illuminating models of institutional organisation of inquiry, uses of T-SEDA resources, participant perceptions and factors underlying (dis)engagement. The findings offer insights into knowledge mobilisation and educational change processes. They yield design principles for scalability and sustainability based on a non-prescriptive model of local ownership and facilitation of self-directed practitioner inquiry and purpose-driven adaptation in complex educational circumstances."

We identify the affordances of these methods for supporting teachers’ reflective practice, focusing in this case on students’ equitable participation in science groupwork activities. This involves the use of Teacher-SEDA (T-SEDA), a sub-scheme of SEDA (Cam-UNAM Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis), which was empirically trialled by a mixed group of researchers and teachers, using video-recordings from primary science classrooms in the UK and Mexico. The T-SEDA trials reported in this paper compare a ‘simulated live’ approach based on time-sampling techniques, with a ‘follow-up analysis’ approach, which uses audio-recordings and transcripts. The findings suggest that using either technique regularly can aid teachers in noticing classroom events and adjusting teaching accordingly. The ‘live’ coding approach appears to be the more practical method that teachers could use to audit the development of classroom equitable participation. However, the follow-up analysis emerged as a more informative approach, shedding light on more ambiguous cases of relative participation."

We deem this necessary amidst an expanding field that still lacks a common vocabulary and means for integrating and comparing available approaches. In the framework, three domains that are key in dialogic teaching are outlined: Teaching-learning, Instruments and Assumptions. These general domains comprise eleven more specific components that reflect key elements considered to play a role in underpinning, supporting and enacting dialogic teaching. We take the framework's components to analyse and compare Thinking Together and Accountable Talk, two well-developed approaches with extensive publications. We highlight the underlying aspects and key features of each approach, such as participant arrangement, talk tools and classroom norms. Finally, we speculate prospective uses of our framework in the field."

First, the main challenges faced by both teachers and teacher education in Chile are summarised. Then, the foundations of this model are presented. Finally, an illustration of the model is provided by presenting two pilot studies implemented in Chile. A qualitative analysis of interviews showed that the programme was successful in promoting teacher reflection, leading to reported changes in their practices. Finally, the advantages and the challenges arising from this study, and the educational possibilities of this model of professional development, are discussed."

However, in the south-central Andes, goldwork is described essentially as a ‘sheet technology’—a definition that tends to downplay the potential complexity and cultural significance of this technology in such an extensive and varied region. Here, we employ a life-history approach to explore the existence of particular traditions within this large area. We present chemical and microscopic analyses, using pXRF, SEM–EDS, PIXE and digital microscopy, of 142 gold and silver objects from San Pedro de Atacama (northern Chile), recovered in seven cemeteries dated to the Middle Period (AD 400–1000). Our results reveal a heterogeneous assemblage where compositions, techniques, designs and skill levels vary, suggesting that gold artefacts circulated and were imported from different areas of the south-central Andes, such as Tiwanaku, Cochabamba and northwest Argentina. We also identify for the first time two distinct technological traditions used in San Pedro: small-scale goldwork production, and a tradition of modifying and reusing imported objects by cutting, perforating and separating object parts. Considering the depositional contexts, we propose that the funerary ritual at San Pedro was a key factor in the development of this local goldwork. Our research demonstrates that even small and unimpressive artefacts can be successfully interrogated from archaeological perspectives with integrative approaches that go beyond overly generalising perspectives of gold as an exotic status marker."
767,4,"TITLE: Technology, Use and Reuse of Gold during the Middle Period: The Case of Casa Parroquial, Atacama Desert, Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The life-histories of gold artefacts can provide rich insight into technology and culture, but so far the potential of this research approach has not been exploited in the south central Andes. Here we present the analysis of 34 gold and silver objects from the Middle Period cemetery of Casa Parroquial (San Pedro de Atacama, northern Chile), using pXRF, SEM-EDS, PIXE and digital microscopy. Chemical analyses detected variable compositions (2.4-73.1 per cent Ag and 0.2-3.4 per cent Cu) suggesting that artisans used both native gold and artificial gold-silver-copper alloys. Based on their manufacturing techniques, quality and designs, we identify two working styles, one technically more 'careful' than the other. Given their elemental and technological variety, together with the lack of local production evidence, we propose that these artefacts were imported as finished objects from Tiwanaku or Cochabamba and northwest Argentina. However, we identify a series of objects that were modified or reshaped as they entered a new cultural context, revealing complex life-histories. Modifications used relatively simple mechanical means: punching, cutting and folding, most likely made in multi-craft contexts by non-metallurgists from San Pedro."

These analyses lead us to hypothesize about the connections with areas such as the Coastal Range in Araucanía (35 km), central Neuquén in Argentina (390 km), and the Bolivian Altiplano/Argentinian Northwest (1900 km). The presence of these goods in Mocha Island and Southern Chile would be part of the deep social transformations undergone by the societies that inhabited these territories toward the end of the first millennium AD, leading to the formation of the El Vergel complex. Los análisis composicionales realizados a piezas de obsidiana, cuentas de turquesa y artefactos metálicos de isla Mocha, permiten plantear un escenario de gran movilidad de bienes para los últimos 1.000 años en el sur de Chile. Dichos análisis permiten plantear hipótesis respecto a vínculos con zonas como la cordillera de la costa en la Araucanía (35 km), Neuquén central en Argentina (390 km) y el Altiplano boliviano/Noroeste argentino (1.900 km).

Amongst the occupations identified at the site, an Early Ceramic component dated between 1110-740 BP stands out; this component is characterised by the use and production of pottery, structures made of quincha, consumption of wild plants and limited camelid exploitation. New excavations in the site MAU085 identified four funerary contexts, far from the domestic settlement. The burials comprise of structures composed of rocks and fractured grinding stones, bones and lithics. The four individuals buried here were infants, associated to offerings such as pottery, a necklace and a metallic ring. The analyses of these burials and its offerings suggest that the Early Ceramic communities were highly mobile and used non-local technologies."

In the present work focused on Chile, we use a high-resolution (∼5 km) gridded product (CR2Met v2.0) to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution and trends of HWs. We analyze daily maximum temperatures (Tx) from late austral spring to early autumn (November to March) to evaluate the HWs behavior during 1980–2020, using three criteria: i) three consecutive days with Tx > 30°C, ii) three consecutive days with Tx > 90th percentile (P90), and iii) three consecutive days with Tx > 95th percentile (P95). We validated our results using HWs statistics based on eighteen official meteorological stations; this procedure revealed a coherence with gridded data mainly over the Central Valley and the Andes. Using the P90 threshold, we found upward trends across the Andes between 20° and 36°S (>1 events per decade), and in the Central Valley between 34° - 43°S (>0.75 events per decade). In addition, using the P90 and P95 thresholds, HWs exhibit upward trends (>1 and 0.5 events per decade, respectively) throughout most of Chile, including Andes and Patagonia. Moreover, using all thresholds, we found an increase in HW frequency during the 2011–2020 megadrought period (ranging from 1 to 4 HWs events/decade) in comparison to the previous period (1980–2010). Meteorological factors such as an increase in the frequency of Puelche (Föhn-like) winds are proposed as an amplifying mechanism of HWs in South-Central Chile."

The MD conditions, combined with intensive agricultural activities and the current water management system, have led to water scarcity problems in Mediterranean and Semi-arid regions of Chile. An emblematic case is the Petorca basin, where a water crisis is undergone. To characterize this crisis, we analyzed water provision by using tree-ring records, remote sensing, instrumental data, and allocated water rights within the basin. Results indicate that the MD is the most severe dry period over the last 700-years of streamflow reconstruction. During the MD, streamflow and water bodies of the upper parts of the basin have been less affected than mid and low areas of this valley, where consumptive withdrawals reach up to 18% of the mean annual precipitation. This extracted volume is similar to the MD mean annual precipitation deficits. The impacts of the current drought, along with the drier climate projections for Central Chile, emphasize the urgency for faster policy changes related to water provision. Climate change adaptation plans and policies should enhance the current monitoring network and the public control of water use to secure the water access for inhabitants and productive activities."

At the local level, congresspersons also play that role. The article describes the type of patronage that exists in the Regional Government of La Araucanía applying a taxonomy proposed by Panizza, Ramos and Scherlis (2014). A qualitative design was used. The results indicate that congresspersons have more influence than the political parties and mayor in determining appointments. It is a heterogeneous patronage, but it is mainly associated with clientelism since it enables the mobilization of voters and the positioning of the parliamentarian."

The results reveal that the programme designers can articulate a general model listing intended outcomes, but the model lacks substantial detail regarding the question of how the specific programme components are linked and arrive at the intended outcomes. In the educational system as a whole, the programme is expected to increase teacher salaries based on individual performance, retain good teachers in the classroom and foster peer mentoring and collaboration. At the level of individual schools, certified teachers are expected to encourage their peers to participate in the programme. Lastly, at the level of individual teachers, certified teachers are supposed to benefit from social recognition and heightened professional self-esteem."

In particular, feedback in elementary school students has not been thoroughly studied. Within this scope, studying the effectiveness of different degrees and types of feedback for primary school students becomes relevant. The present study looks at two types of feedback designed for problem-solving in primary school: Knowledge of Results and Elaborated Feedback. A series of interactive problems was designed for tablets to cover a range of topics for fifth-grade mathematics. Through a quasi-experimental design, one group of students (n = 31) was provided with Elaborated Feedback, while another group (n = 33) was provided with Knowledge of Results. Feedback was given to the students as they worked on the interactive problems over 6 sessions. The effectiveness of both types of feedback was then measured using a pre- and post-test. Although Elaborated Feedback helped the students achieve better results during the sessions, the Knowledge of Results group scored higher on the post-test. The results add to the growing debate on the supposed benefits of providing increasing levels of information or guidance, in an area that shows scarce and contradicting evidence."
777,-1,"TITLE: Integrating critical thinking into the classroom: A teacher's perspective | KEYWORDS: Critical thinking; Curriculum enaction; Inservice teachers; Teachers' perspectives; Teaching practices | ABSTRACT: Studies on critical thinking often overlook the work done by teachers in the classroom to develop this skill. However, studying critical thinking from the teacher's perspective is key to closing the gap between theory and practice. This study looks to characterize the work done by Spanish-speaking teachers in Latin America to integrate critical thinking into their practice. To do so, an online survey was sent to the participants of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), asking them to describe their work with critical thinking in their classroom. Responses from 278 participantes were then analysed using an exploratory sequential design. During the qualitative phase, a series of categories emerged based on the topics chosen by the teachers, the activities they proposed, and how they linked these to the development of critical thinking. The frequency with which these categories appeared in the teachers’ responses was then measured during a subsequent quantitative phase. Variations in these frequencies were also analysed based on the subjects taught by the teachers and the age of the students. The results reveal that teachers primarily try to develop their students’ critical thinking skills by integrating them into their subjects; not teaching them separately. Furthermore, they do so by choosing topics that help the students understand the world better from different subject-specific practices. Therefore, when implemented by teachers, critical thinking is highly dependent on the subject. These results suggest that there is a mismatch between educational practice and existing research, which tends to advocate the specific and explicit teaching of critical thinking, whether as a separate subject or through a cross-curriculum approach."

However, collaboration does not occur spontaneously; instead it needs to be guided by appropriate scaffolding. In this study we explore whether a script that explicitly incorporates constructing arguments in collaborative problem-solving activities improves learning. In order to do so, a study was conducted involving 75 students from a lower-middle class state-subsidized private school in Santiago de Chile. These students were divided into three groups, each of which worked on geometry activities over 10 sixty-minute sessions that were held across a period of four weeks. To isolate the effect of incorporating technology, the first of these groups did not work with technology. The second group worked with a collaborative script that was developed for use with a tablet, while the third group used the same technology with an integrated tool that explicitly allowed the students to build arguments. We conclude that having students reflect on their own processes and outcomes by arguing their point of view can lead to an improvement in learning, more so than the technology itself."
779,2,"TITLE: Self-perceived stigma in Chilean adolescents with intellectual disability | KEYWORDS: intellectual disability, Chile; self-stigma | ABSTRACT: Stigma is a form of negative social stereotype characterized by a lack of respect toward an individual or a group of people. It is defined as a personal attribute that triggers negative stereotypes, leading to adverse effects on the individuals concerned. This study aims to explore the self-perceived stigma experienced by adolescents with intellectual disabilities in Chile. We explored self-perceived stigma in 139 Chilean adolescents, using the Perceived Stigma of Intellectual Disability Scale, which was translated and adapted for the Chilean population as part of this project. We calculated total stigma scores as well as scores for various subscales. Additionally, we conducted analyses of variance, independent t tests, and chi-square tests to identify differences in self-stigma based on various sociodemographic factors. The total self-perceived stigma score was relatively low among Chilean adolescents with intellectual disabilities compared to previously published reports from other countries. Some variations in reactions to discrimination were observed based on the type of schooling, particularly strong negative reactions associated with attending special schools. The low self-perceived stigma reported by Chilean adolescents with intellectual disabilities may be attributed to social and cultural factors, as well as the availability of social opportunities and their intensity. Future studies should further investigate the impact of special schools on individuals with intellectual disabilities in Chile."

Evidence suggests differences in HLE components based on cultural and idiosyncratic characteristics. Most studies show a relationship between contextual variables with the quality of HLE in typically developing (TD) children. There are HLE studies with families of children with Down syndrome (DS) that show similar results, but the characteristics of HLE for Latin-American families of children with DS remain unexplored. This study analyses the HLE in a group of 161 families of children with DS, between 3 and 12 years of age, living in urban areas of Chile. Data were collected using an online survey. Results showed differences on the amount of literacy materials, linguistic environment, and beliefs and expectations of parents. Better HLE was observed in families with parents with high educational levels. In the context of previous studies from developed countries with families of children with DS and from Chile with families of TD children, the HLE of families with children with DS in Chile seems poor. This descriptive evidence is necessary to raise concerns in policy makers and national funding agencies to open a way to conduct experimental studies."
781,2,"TITLE: As far as possible: The relationship between public awareness, social distance, and stigma towards people with intellectual disability | KEYWORDS: Chile; disorders of intellectual development; intellectual development disorder; intellectual disability; public policy; stigma | ABSTRACT: Research shows that people with intellectual disability (ID) face public stigma. However, a recently published narrative review suggests that this phenomenon has not been explored in a Latin American country. This study fills the gap in our understanding of public stigma towards people with intellectual disability in Chile. 395 adults from the general population (18 to 78 years) participated in the survey. Using the Intellectual Disability Literacy Scale, adapted for Chile, we explored the participants' literacy about ID, their causal beliefs, and desire of social distance. Only 1.3% of the sample identified intellectual disability in the instrument's vignette. The most common causal attribution for the condition was environmental, followed by biomedical factors. Participants showed a high desire of social distance, with higher scores associated with more educated participants. Our findings show that low literacy about intellectual disability and a high desire for social distance are significant factors contributing to public stigma in Chile. These are tangible targets for change that can lead to increased social inclusion and participation of people with intellectual disability in Chile. Any such approaches are likely to be transferable to other Latin American countries and could help reduce public stigma for this population."

Lack of knowledge about their rights and tools for effective self-advocacy seem to be key elements that need to be improved to facilitate participation. Method: We present PaísDI, a 16 h long manualised program created by self-advocates in collaboration with an interdisciplinary team, with four modules: rights and intellectual disability, leadership in intellectual disability, effective communication and financial considerations of social projects. This quasi-experimental study had 349 participants, divided in three groups: people with intellectual disability, relatives and professionals. Feasibility and effectiveness where measured. Results: The program is shown to be viable and effective, especially in its impact on self-perception for self-advocacy activities. Conclusion: The discussion highlights Chile's historic debt in creating policies that promote self-determination, knowledge and the empowerment of people with intellectual disability, to bolster their participation as citizens."

Method: we evaluated 60 infants (10–36 months) with ABAS-II (32 with DS, 28 with TD). Using the developmental trajectories method for data analysis, we compared AB between the two groups. Results: We found significant differences between groups in most of the skills assessed, in favour of infants with TD. Three different patterns of trajectories were found for the AB and the relation between the groups: (1) no differences (Leisure and Self-Care Skills); (2) differences at the beginning of the trajectory and then a similar slope (Home Living, Self-Direction, Social and Motor Skills); and (3) a similar starting-point with differences in the trajectories (Communication, Community Use, Pre-Academic, and Health and Safety). Conclusions: This empirical cross-sectional study contributes to the understanding of the development of AB in children with DS, showing both weak areas and skills that continue improving over time in these early years. Contributions and limitations of the study are discussed."

The aim of the study is to characterise parental attitudes and styles of fathers of children with intellectual disabilities, and to analyse their relation to the children's adaptive behaviour. Method: Eighty-three families (fathers and mothers) answered self-report questionnaires, which assessed parenting styles and attitudes, as well as an adaptive behaviour questionnaire about their children with intellectual disabilities between 4 and 18 years of age. Results: Both parents have a tendency towards an authoritative style of parenting. Fathers (versus mothers) perceive greater parental support but are less involved in their children's lives. Among fathers, the authoritative style was a significant contributor to the child's adaptive behaviour, above and beyond the mother's contribution. Conclusions: Studies about parenting should include both mothers and fathers, as paternal parenting styles and attitudes are related to children's adaptive behaviour."

Environmental factors such as socioeconomic level (SEL) influence reading and maths skills as well as EFs. The aim of this study is to explore the extent to which executive functions play a mediating role between SEL and reading and maths performance. To this end, we assessed 286 Chilean primary education students: 86 with a high SEL and 200 with a low level. The results show that the high-SEL group obtained consistently higher scores than their peers with low SEL levels in both reading and maths tasks as well as in EF measurements. This suggests that SEL could influence the development of these variables. The results also showed that EFs partially mediate the relation between SEL and reading and maths skills in primary school students through the specific function of inhibition. The results are discussed in light of the effect of SEL on the development of EFs and school learning."
786,6,"TITLE: Effects of the built environment and sociodemographic factors on accessibility in the city of Valparaíso, Chile | KEYWORDS: Accessibility; Built environment; Chile; Sociodemographic conditions; Valparaíso | ABSTRACT: The city of Valparaíso, Chile, presents a centralized urban environment with a compact plain area that concentrates most of the commerce and services and hills in its surroundings where most people reside. Within this context and in addition to complex sociodemographic and topographical conditions, it is possible to question how the built environment and sociodemographic factors influence the accessibility conditions in this city. In this direction, this study seeks to understand the effects of the abovementioned factors on accessibility, with particular attention on leisure and work trips. This analysis is based on different combinations of least square regression models. In general, results show that the built environment has more effects on leisure accessibility, while work accessibility is conditioned to sociodemographic factors. Thus, results show that the city does not present an urban environment that delivers reliability for work trips, which is pressured by time and costs. To promote a sustainable and equitable development of the city of Valparaíso, it is relevant to consider the adequation and improving the built environment for work trips. Regarding leisure trips, there is a need to promote measures to improve safety on streets and access to low-capacity public transport. These measures are vital for promoting sustainable mobility in the city of Valparaíso."
787,3,"TITLE: Perceptions of people with reduced mobility regarding universal accessibility at bus stops: A pilot study in Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: Bus stop; Mobility in community; Phenomenological study; Public transport; Reduced mobility; Universal accessibility | ABSTRACT: Universal Accessibility is an important condition to promote a better quality of life and well-being, especially in public transport, which allows free mobility, connection with the environment, and occupational participation. The Public Transport System of the “Red Metropolitana de Movilidad” in Santiago de Chile seeks that buses should have measures that facilitate their use; however, bus stops present challenges that people with reduced mobility (PRM) experience each day. The objective is to study their experiences regarding the perceived accessibility at bus stops, and if this influences their mobility in the community, considering the COVID-19 context. The population addressed is PRM who use mobility aids or assistance and need more space to move. The methodology is a qualitative phenomenological study through semi-structured individual interviews. The results showed a negative perception of accessibility, reporting experiences associated with barriers, challenges, and opportunities that influence successful participation in mobility in the community. In conclusion, there is a lack of regulations regarding the characteristics of these spaces, being necessary to incorporate the perception of PRM into the design to guarantee the right to move in equal conditions."
788,3,"TITLE: Exploring the pedestrian level of interaction on platform conflict areas at metro stations by real-scale laboratory experiments | KEYWORDS: behaviour; interaction; metro station; Pedestrian; platform | ABSTRACT: To reduce passenger interactions improvement on platform designs is needed. Present procedures use the level of service (LOS) based only on average values and therefore is not possible to identify which piece of space reached the highest interaction. This paper explores a new method to classify the interaction between passengers boarding and alighting through laboratory experiments under controlled conditions. The experiments were based on observation at two stations operated by London Underground Limited, which included platform edge doors and a semi-circular space defined as platform conflict area. Results were expressed according to the types of queues, formation of lanes, density by layer, and distance between passengers. The level of interaction was a more precise indicator compared to the LOS. The density by layer followed a logarithmic distribution, reaching almost four times the overall density. Further research needs to be conducted to measure the passenger space on the platform."

When these interchanges are not well designed, walking is inefficient and can be unsafe for pedestrians. This paper analyses, by means of a pedestrian microsimulation model, metro–bus interchange spaces in order to propose planning guidelines for the city of Santiago de Chile. Specific objectives are (1) to identify the variables that provide efficiency and safety in those spaces; (2) to simulate different scenarios using the pedestrian simulation model LEGION; (3) to propose planning and design guidelines for pedestrian spaces at metro–bus interchanges; and (4) to contrast the recommendations in the recently opened terminal station on Line 1 of Metro de Santiago: Los Dominicos Station."
790,3,"TITLE: Experimental study for estimating capacity of cycle lanes | KEYWORDS: capacity; cycle lanes; cycle tracks; cyclists; saturation flow | ABSTRACT: Today some cycle lanes are reaching high levels of flow. Clear examples are the cycle-track Pocuro in Santiago de Chile and the cycle-lane Tavistock Square in London. The problem presented in this research is the lack of measurements for estimating the capacity of cycle lanes at traffic signals. Therefore, it cannot be identified through indicators whether cycle lanes are saturated or not. For this reason there is no record of the capacity they can offer. As a methodology we established four steps. Firstly, we measured the physical and operational variables of cycle lanes, and we investigated about international studies related to their capacities. Then we used the approach of the Road Note 34 (RRL, 1963) to measure the saturation flow and transient periods of cycle lanes, taking as case study Santiago de Chile and London. In addition, we defined different scenarios of experiments. Finally, the results were transformed into design recommendations to provide an adequate level of service for cyclists. The main results of this research shows that the saturation flow grows almost linearly with the width. When cyclists formed in lanes, the saturation flow increased only if a new lane was formed. In the case of the cycle-track Pocuro, for a width of 1.0 m the saturation flow reached 2070 bicycle/h-lane. If the width increased to 2.0 m, the saturation flow reached 4657 bicycle/h-lane. In relation to Tavistock Square, this cycle-lane (width of 1.0 m) reached a saturation flow of 4320 bicycle/h-lane. As a conclusion, this research can be used by traffic engineers to estimate the saturation flow of cycle lanes and delays of cyclists at traffic signals. This in turn can help in designing cycle facilities at transport infrastructures. The validation of our investigation can also help transport planners with the calculation of the capacity, optimum width, comfort, and other operational costs of cycle lanes."

Concentration was given to achieve a balanced data collection from best practices and green certified non-residential projects located in different climate conditions in the U.S. Data mining techniques, such as classification tree and statistical tools that included Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), a 2-sample t-test, and regression, were adopted for analysis of this group of buildings. It was found that there were common functional and technical features, as well as similar performances of existing buildings linked to these buildings’ energy consumption. These findings could not only inform the new design of facades, but facade retrofits could be strategically established based on lessons learned from real practice."

The ISA virus and market prices | KEYWORDS: Bresnahan–Lau model; error correction model; market power; price determination; salmon disease; salmon market | ABSTRACT: We analyzed whether a competitive market can behave non-competitively when it is temporarily outside of its long-run equilibrium trajectory. Our data sample allowed us to examine the functioning of the Atlantic salmon market in the United States when experiencing a sharp reduction in imports because of a sanitary outbreak that affected its Chilean suppliers. We estimated the Steen and Salvanes extension of the Bresnahan–Lau model. Our results show that in the long run, the market behaves competitively. However, there is evidence of a disequilibrium effect on price in the recovery phase of the crisis. The decrease in the price observed during the recovery was caused by supply overshooting, whereas the increase in salmon’s market price observed right after the disease outbreak cannot be attributed to reduced Chilean supply."

Methods An observational study of 250 patients aged 65 years or older was conducted in a large teaching hospital. Beers (2012) and STOPP (2008) criteria were utilized to identify PIMs. Data on age, sex, admission and discharge dates, diagnoses, and medications prescribed were obtained from medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine patient variables related with the prescription of PIMs. Key findings Using Beers criteria, 375 PIMs were identified in 198 patients. 32% of these patients were prescribed one PIM, 20% were prescribed two PIMs, and 48% were prescribed more than two PIMs. Using STOPP criteria, 148 PIMs were identified in 120 patients. 41% of these patients were prescribed one PIM, 51% were prescribed two PIMs, and 8% were prescribed more than two PIMs. An association between PIM prescribing and polypharmacy was detected with both criteria. After adjusting for confounding variables, the prescription of Beers-identified PIMs was significantly associated with patients older than 80 (OR: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.13–7.89) and with length of hospital stay of more than 15 days (OR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.20–6.44). Conclusion These two criteria showed that the prescription of PIMs is prevalent in hospitalized elderly patients. It may be beneficial to educate healthcare teams about these criteria to reduce the prescription of PIMs."

Despite significant advancements attributed to the unique characteristics of 3D data, existing SO(3)-equivariant approaches often fall short in seamlessly integrating local and global contextual information in a widely generalizable manner. Our contributions in this paper are threefold. First, we introduce Spherical Patch Fields, a representation technique designed for patch-wise, SO(3)-equivariant 3D point clouds, anchored theoretically on the principles of Spherical Gaussians. Second, we present the Patch Gaussian Layer, designed for the adaptive extraction of local and global contextual information from resizable point cloud patches. Culminating our contributions, we present Learnable Spherical Patch Fields (DeepSPF) - a versatile and easily integrable backbone suitable for instance-based point networks. Through rigorous evaluations, we demonstrate significant enhancements in Scan-to-CAD performance for point cloud registration, retrieval, and completion: a significant reduction in the rotation error of existing registration methods, an improvement of up to 17% in the Top-1 error for retrieval tasks, and a notable reduction of up to 30% in the Chamfer Distance for completion models, all attributable to the incorporation of DeepSPF."

However, empirical studies on their capacity to alter segregation dynamics associated with school choice remain limited. Using a child-centred perspective, this article explores working-class children’s cartographies of school choice following a policy reform aimed at removing barriers to choice and reducing segregation in Chile. Through a sociological lens and a mixed-methods approach, we investigate how 8th-grade students define, experience, and negotiate their secondary school options. Despite the apparent expansion of choice brought about by the reform, our findings highlight the enduring influence of social class and geography in shaping children’s schooling decisions and the symbolic strategies they employ to navigate the unequal educational landscape. We contribute to addressing the underrepresentation of children’s voices in school choice research and discuss the challenges faced by the new regulations in disrupting segregation dynamics associated with school choice."

Considering the critical role of parents in education policy, we explore families’ negotiations about the new school admission system, focusing on the moral dilemmas they experience when confronted with changes in the rules that organize the distribution of school seats and the notions of educational justice they adhere to. We draw on interviews with 80 families from different social classes and belonging to five regions of Chile who were choosing a school under the new school admission system. Our findings underline that—while families tend to agree with the principle of equal formal opportunities in the school admission field—the reform brings in a set of moral dilemmas and competing notions of justice that encompass its different components. Based on these findings, we shed light on the distance between policy intention and interpretation, and between abstract conceptualizations of justice in educational policies and what counts as just policies in families’ views. In addition, we outline a set of implications for justice-oriented reforms worldwide."

In that context, this article tackles the recent equity-oriented reform introduced in the highly marketised Chilean school system. Based on in-depth interviews, we explore the responses of middle-class parents to the implementation of a new centralised admission system that modified the school choice rules. Our findings differentiate five types of responses. Alongside uncovering a significant opposition from parents for whom the reform is experienced as a threat to their middle-classness, we found a variety of stances consistent with heterogeneity within the broader middle class, and we reveal a high ambivalence in their policy interpretations. From these findings, we discuss the sociocultural complexities of reforms aimed at balancing choice and equity, and we contribute to prior literature by unravelling the nuances in the middle-class attitudes towards desegregation policies."

In this context, a growing number of studies has pointed out that the experience of learning at home is an essential factor influencing their subjective well-being, raising the importance of parental involvement in the educational process of their children. This article explores the formal and informal parental practices of home learning during school closures period in 19 countries and their explanatory factors, with the further aim of discussing their implications for children’s subjective well-being. The study uses the International COVID-19 Impact on Parental Engagement Study (ICIPES) database and develops a regression analysis of family, child, and school factors predicting parental involvement in homeschooling. The main findings show that parents’ socioeconomic status is a critical predictor of both formal and informal parental practices. In addition, the results denote the impact of other factors, such as the level of parental confidence with the use of technology and children’s age and gender (in the case of informal activities). Based on these findings, the article discusses policy implications to promote parental involvement and children’s subjective well-being."

The study is framed on the 'zone of mediation' approach to desegregation policies, and is based on a case study of three private-subsidized schools of Magallanes-which educate different middle-class fractions and have undergone changes in their social composition since the introduction of the New School Admission System. The findings highlight the powerful normative and political forces embedded on parents' resistance to the reform, underscore the construction of symbolic distinctions and pressures for separation between old/new students within communities, and point to the weak role of schools in confronting families' apprehensions. Based on these findings, the article discusses the complexity of implementing the Inclusion Law in middle-class schools and the challenges of moving toward desegregation within schools."

This system was designed to increase educational equity by changing the previous school admission “rules” that were prejudicial against low-income students. We use Bourdieu’s conceptual tools, drawing on concepts of capitals and field, to analyse the influence of the new rules of the game on the value of middle-class capitals. To understand how the new rules shape middle-class families’ advantages, we link qualitative and quantitative analyses that empirically explore how families subjectively interpret the policy change and how objectively it shapes their access to desired schools. The qualitative phase shows that middle-class parents experience the NSAS as a risky new scenario. However, quantitative analysis shows the NSAS is associated with only a modest decrease in middle class-advantages. We illustrate the difficulty of transforming marketized educational systems, where previously privileged families react against equity-driven changes."

Recently, an emergent line of studies has focused on the case of mostly white middle-class parents, who, in contrast to the dominant trend identified by sociological research, choose or are willing to choose a socially, racially and/or ethnically diverse school for their children. The purpose of this article is to review the literature published between 2000 and 2017 on this nascent field, exploring the characteristics of families’ ‘against the grain’ choice processes, the parental practices deployed for managing school diversity, and their consequences for intra-school integration. Results highlight (a) the tensions underlying parental choices for diversity, (b) the multiple individual and collective practices that families implement to confront sociocultural school mix, and (c) the implications for the emergence of social and racial/ethnic intra-school segregation and power dynamics within communities. Based on the findings presented, the article discusses suggestions for further research."

Comparative research in this area has been mainly focused on developed countries and has tended to neglect the situation of developing nations, including Latin American countries. Considering the above, this article presents the current status of school leadership policies in eight systems of Latin America: Argentina, Ceará/Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Dominican Republic and Peru. The results highlight that, while in the majority of these systems measures aimed in this direction have been implemented, school leadership policies are still at an early stage, with several problems, contradictions, and lack of internal and external coherence. The article ends with a discussion about the tensions embedded on the translation of the Anglo-Saxon discourse of school leadership to the particular context of Latin America and suggests the need to rethink a regional local–response to the goal of promoting principal leadership."

In Chile, in contrast, the analysis of parental choice processes, in the context of the high level of social segregation within the school system, have emerged only recently within the research agenda. Within these trends, this paper explores and contrasts the dynamics of school choice of middle and lower classes, from a qualitative perspective. The results question the discursive principles held by advocates of school choice, providing evidence about the processes by which families produce and contribute, by their school choices, to the segregation and stratification of the system, in the context of the specific policy design in which school choice is currently enacted."

By doing so, the authors seek to provide valuable evidence to inform the development of policies to attract and maintain well-qualified teachers from industry in Chile and other countries facing similar changes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a descriptive cross-sectional design to collect data from 660 VET teachers using a two-scale instrument: Perception of Prior Occupation (PPO) and adapted FIT-Choice scales. By adopting a typological approach, the authors constructed profiles of VET teachers based on their perception of past industry experience. The authors then analyzed how these profiles vary regarding individual teacher characteristics, motivation and perception of teaching in VET. Findings: The authors found a significant degree of heterogeneity among VET teachers' prior industry experiences, leading them to identify three distinct VET teacher profiles: “High Perception of Prior Occupation,” “Learning and Teaching-Oriented” and “Low Perception of Prior Occupation.” Notably, the most distinguishing characteristics across these profiles were age, VET teaching area, holding a job outside of teaching and years of prior industry experience. Furthermore, the authors found that motivation and perceptions of teaching varied significantly across these VET teacher profiles. Originality/value: There needs to be more research on the factors that attract and retain industry workers as VET teachers in high schools. This study is among the first to address this topic in a non-European context."

We recruited nursing students from five Chilean postsecondary vocational–technical education institutions and surveyed them regarding their perceptions of supports, barriers, and beliefs. Despite male nursing technician students reporting more perceived job discrimination and instructional barriers, these factors did not affect their self-efficacy or career expectations. Additionally, males reported less parental support, which exhibited a positive correlation with their career self-efficacy and expectations. We frame these findings within existing literature and offer practical guidance for postsecondary institutions."
811,1,"TITLE: Gender gap in STEM pathways: the role of secondary curricula in a highly differentiated school system—the case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Gender differences; Higher education; STEM pipeline; Vocational education | ABSTRACT: Background: STEM fields are instrumental in increasing the technological and innovative capacity of the economy. As women are underrepresented in the STEM workforce, diverse strategies have been implemented to boost their preparedness and interest in these fields, including early exposure to academic and vocational STEM courses. Using the case of Chile’s highly differentiated school system, this paper examines the role of secondary curricula on students’ enrollment and persistence in STEM programs offered by vocational postsecondary institutions and universities. In doing so, we seek to identify whether exposure to STEM courses within the academic or vocational tracks translates into fewer gender differences in STEM higher education. Results: Our results reveal that upper-secondary tracks connected to STEM courses are positively associated with enrollment in STEM higher education and, to some degree, persistence. More specifically, exposure to STEM courses in the academic track is the most effective path to boost chances of enrolling in STEM university programs but has no connection to later persistence. In contrast, applied STEM courses within the vocational tracks perform better in the case of STEM programs in postsecondary vocational institutions both in enrollment and persistence. However, this STEM pipeline significantly amplifies gender gaps as males benefit more than women from early exposure to applied STEM courses. We also found that other indirect routes, such as enrolling in STEM university programs from the vocational track with applied STEM courses, boost female participation in these programs, helping reduce gender gaps. Conclusions: While secondary STEM courses attract more female students to STEM higher education, they alone are insufficient to achieve gender equality in STEM fields as gender gaps widen in the more effective routes. In highly differentiated school systems, policymakers and high school leaders should offer increased support to women interested in STEM studies and careers across all secondary tracks to boost female participation in STEM fields. At the same time, all high school students should be able to select both academic and applied STEM courses as a part of their non-mandatory curriculum."
812,1,"TITLE: Reinforcing the STEM pipeline in vocational-technical high schools: The effect of female teachers | KEYWORDS: Female teacher; Role model; STEM; STEM pipeline; Vocational-technical education | ABSTRACT: Although secondary Vocational-Technical Education (VTE) is highly prevalent in low-income settings in the developing world, this sector remains understudied in the Economics of Education literature. Situated in the Chilean context, this study examines the effect of exposure to a female VTE teacher on STEM pipeline persistence from secondary to post-secondary level. We find that having at least one female teacher in secondary STEM-VTE programs increases overall enrollment in STEM higher education programs by 2.1 percentage points, primarily driven by women choosing postsecondary VTE diplomas in STEM fields. The effect of female VTE teachers in enrollment in these diplomas reaches 4.0 percentage points, equivalent to an 18% reduction in the observed gender gap. We argue that female VTE teachers, acting as role models, have the potential to mitigate the traditional barriers that young women encounter to persist in the STEM pipeline, thereby contributing to closing the STEM gender gap."

This article examines their distinctive motivations and perceptions in the exercise of the teaching profession, using an adapted version of a model of factors influencing the choice of teaching as a career (FIT-Choice). We applied the model to a sample of 1,117 GET and VET in Chilean vocational schools. We found that both types of teachers concur in reporting intrinsic and altruistic motivations, in addition to the ability to teach, as the main determinants of the choice of teaching. On the other hand, VET also value the personal utility that teaching reports, so they exhibit multiple motivations for exercising their profession to a greater extent. Even though entering into teaching was not an alternative sought, this came from ""circumstances"" that occurred in their professional career. Based on these findings, we provide policy recommendations for teacher attraction to vocational schools that recognize the distinctive profile of VET."

A Vision from the Capability Approach | KEYWORDS: adolescents; capability approach; citizenship; marginality; students; Vocational education | ABSTRACT: The capability approach provides a broader view of Vocational and Technical Education (VTE), acknowledging its multiple purposes, including citizenship preparation for discussing and challenging the rules and practices prevailing in society. Based on ethnographic data, this paper seeks to understand how two Chilean high schools conceptualise their students and VTE, concerning their students’ marginalisation, linking this to citizenship education. Each school presented a different awareness of students’ marginality situation, and it was possible to observe how this meant different actions associated with citizenship education. Findings show that in the school with greater awareness of students’ marginality, VTE takes elements from the capability approach and provides active citizenship training, while at the school with lower awareness of marginality, students are trained in more passive citizenship. The importance of citizenship education for VTE, the significance of the capability approach to transforming this education, and its potential impact on public policies and the construction of society are discussed."

Experiencias de practica profesional de estudiantes mujeres de Educacion Tecnico Profesional | KEYWORDS: gender discrimination; gender inequality; internship; Vocational-Technical Education | ABSTRACT: Internships are essential for student trajectories of Vocational-Technical Education (VTE), as they allow the reinforcement of learning achieved in the classroom and provide knowledge and vocational maturity that can only be completed in the labor context. This article shows the difficulties that female students face in male-dominated Vocational-Technical Education (VTE) programs during their experiences of internship in the workplace. To do this, based on 29 interviews of female graduates from these programs, we analyze the process of doing and undoing gender, and how women negotiate their gender when facing discrimination in the companies that host them as practitioners. The findings reveal women's adjustment strategies that combine resistance and acceptance in a context where companies do not adjust their dynamics and practices to integrate them. Instead, women adapt their behaviors to the cultural norms of implicit and explicit sexism in the learning workplaces. Thus, the arrival of all female students to the companies is an opening act, which requires them to conquer their own space configured from exceptionality. This situation reduces the potential of apprenticeships to drive successful transitions to the labor market."
816,1,"TITLE: Understanding motivational beliefs of women in postsecondary STEM- vocational-technical education. Evidence from Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; expectancy-value theory; gender stereotypes; Vocational and Technical Education; women in STEM | ABSTRACT: Women face many barriers to entry into and persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Drawing on expectancy-value theory (EVT) and using a qualitative approach, this study sought to deeply understand women’s entry and persistence in STEM-related postsecondary Vocational Technical Education (VTE) programs that lead to male-dominated skilled trades in construction, metalworking, and mining sectors in Chile. The findings revealed that, depending on the economic sector women were preparing to work in, different motivational patterns of EVT beliefs emerged that allowed women to overcome the high costs imposed by the gender stereotypes they encountered in their studies. Therefore, to improve women participation in VTE programs related to STEM fields, institutional and government policies must consider these different motivational profiles, as well as different strategies to improve women identity with these male-typed skilled trades."
817,1,"TITLE: Career Development in Highly Sex-typed Postsecondary Vocational Technical Education Programs: A Social Cognitive Analysis | KEYWORDS: postsecondary education; sex-atypical careers; social cognitive career theory; socioeconomic status; vocational-technical education | ABSTRACT: Using social cognitive career theory (SCCT), we examined the career development of students in sex-typed postsecondary Vocational Technical Education (VTE) programs in the Chilean context. We assessed the moderating effects of students’ socioeconomic background, sex, membership to the sex-atypical group, and the intersection of these attributes across SCCT measures and the model’s predicted relationships. The results showed that students in sex-atypical careers, particularly low-income students, perceived supports and barriers differently, and that supports and barriers have different effects on self-efficacy and outcome beliefs. We also found differences between female and male students in these careers path, which suggests that the former face more challenges. However, we also found that their career development process unfolds similarly, suggesting that strategies designed to support these groups may be equally helpful for female and male students. We discuss the findings in light of prior literature and offer practical implications for VTE institutions."
818,0,"TITLE: Vocational education and social inequalities in within- and between-school curriculum tracking | KEYWORDS: access higher education; socioeconomic segregation; tracking effects; Vocational education | ABSTRACT: Using rich administrative data from the Chilean education system, this paper looked at the link between curriculum tracking and social inequalities considering the way that tracking is organised: between- or within- schools. In particular, it examines the influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on track placement (general or vocational), and gaps in higher education access between graduates from both tracks. Result suggests that in a highly socially differentiated education system such as the Chilean one, within-school tracking diminishes SES segregation between tracks. However, the study does not provide evidence that this specific form of tracking mitigates inequalities between tracks, as measured by access to higher education. Considering only the direct effects of tracking operating through instructional and institutional mechanisms, the access gap between general and vocational tracks increases instead of narrowing. The implications for future research are discussed in light of these finding."

This paper uses extensive administrative data of the Chilean educational system to estimate the magnitude and evolution of socioeconomic segregation between- and within-school curriculum tracking. Results indicate that the unequal distribution of students by socioeconomic status between tracks narrows when tracking takes place within schools, mainly in the presence of market incentives that lead schools to focus on particular student populations."
820,-1,"TITLE: Patterns and persistence of educational mismatch: A trajectory approach using chilean panel data | KEYWORDS: Educational mismatch; Overeducation; Persistence; Wage penalties; Work trajectories | ABSTRACT: The misalignment between workers’ educational levels and the educational level typically required for their occupations, namely educational mismatch, has become widespread. However, despite its potential costs, there is little evidence of this situation in developing countries. Using longitudinal and retrospective data of employment histories between 2009 and 2019, this paper conducts sequence analysis to construct a typology of educational mismatch trajectories among Chilean workers. We demonstrate that mismatch is a prevalent and persistent phenomenon. Once people enter the labor market, either as undereducated or overeducated workers, they tend to stay in such positions for extended periods of time. Moreover, we find significant wage penalties for workers in a mismatch situation. Results indicate that females and young, less-educated men are more prone to follow trajectories with longer periods of mismatch or unemployment. New avenues for research and the need for public policies looking at these phenomena are required to avoid people’s dissatisfaction due to a possible false promise that more education can improve their life standards."
821,-1,"TITLE: Labour market mismatch in emerging countries: the case of Chile | KEYWORDS: higher education; Occupational mismatch; overqualification; overskilling; PIAAC | ABSTRACT: One of the most salient characteristics of the recent evolution of Chilean higher education system is its rapid expansion. Conversely, the competencies required for the workforce have been slower to emerge. This paper examines the incidence of qualification and skill mismatches across different populations, across age groups, gender, and educational levels. The discrepancy between the qualifications and skills possessed by workers, and those required to perform their jobs is measured using the Survey of Adult Skills-PIAAC and a national socioeconomic survey. Our results suggest that overeducation is increasing across time, affecting mainly younger, higher educated workers. Overskilling is also a widespread phenomenon among this group, probably due to a crowding out process. Moreover, the high competition for accessing the best positions is leading to credential inflation. Thus, the axiom that education per se leads to a good job, which guides much student decision-making, seems increasingly diffuse and requires urgent review."
822,1,"TITLE: “Women in men’s fields”: Gender discourses in secondary vocational schools ”Mulheres no campo dos homens”: Discursos de gênero nas escolas técnicas e profissionais do ensino médio “Mujeres en terrenos de hombres”: Discursos de género en escuelas secundarias técnico-profesionales | KEYWORDS: Discourse analysis; Gender inequality; Gender stereotypes; Teacher narratives; Vocational-technical education | ABSTRACT: In secondary vocational technical education (VET) there is a strong gender segmentation between different fields of study linked to different status and salaries. In particular, women are a minority in trade schools in which the structures and cultures reinforce the masculine image of the professions. Based on 19 interviews conducted in six schools from three regions of Chile, this article analyzes the principal and teacher discourses displayed in these environments. We identified three discursive positions according to the approach of the students’ gender: (1) invisible gender, as considering gender as not proper category to address school issues, (2) binary positions gender, that naturalizes and acclaim traditional roles distinguished by biological sex, (3) gender visible at outside, that shows inequities between men and women but in the labor market. The article concludes that the three discursive positions by making invisible, normalizing or situating gender inequalities outside the school space, neglect teacher positions of responsibility and agency to transform school cultures and structures in schools that perpetuate the sexual division of work."

Using qualitative material, this article analyzes the experience of four polyvalent establishments in Santiago de Chile, and identifies institutional strategies for organization and distribution of students between the two developmental alternatives. Although the findings suggest that the polyvalent model fails to substantially alter the existing segmentation in the system as a whole, it is possible to employ strategies to overcome the duality, mainly those which seek to favor greater balance in the valuation of academic and vocational curricula, which may prove highly relevant for the promotion of more integrated educational systems which recognize and channel the different interests and aspirations of students."

For this, it is necessary to install reliable and legitimate procedures of recognizing of previous learning (RPL) in higher education. This article examines a sample of eleven cases of postsecondary institutions to describe the convergences and divergences that RPL has in terms of: 1) purposes and meanings; 2) forms and procedures; 3) expected results; 4) vision and projections. We found that, although there is a consensual agreement in the institutions regarding the relevance of RPL, the absence of institutional, organizational and cultural conditions limits the massive placement of this practice. However, it is possible to identify virtuous experiences, when the productive sector is a RAP intermediary between workers and postsecondary VET institutions."

The aim is to show how gender differences are produced in this sector, in a setting in which the rhetoric of gender equality taking force. We found that there is a high students and teachers’ approval of women participation in these field of study. However, discourses that give a lower profile to student gender, would prevent addressing unique problems faced by female students in a male-dominated environment. Likewise, micro-practices which reproduced gender stereotypes inside VET schools, as well as limitations to performs labor internship in industrial sector companies, would be obstacles not overcome yet for women persistence in this path. We conclude that to address gender issues in VET sector is a challenge that involve actors from educational and work world, and implies a deep questioning of the traditional way of doing things in this sector."

This paper studies the relationship between the secondary school track attended by Chilean students (vocational or academic) and their subsequent outcomes in access to and persistence in postsecondary vocational programs. Although it is expected that vocational students will display lower access to higher education programs, due to their less intense curriculum and the generally non-academic environment of their schools, their performance in post-secondary vocational programs is unclear. Field-specific knowledge and vocational maturity could improve the performance of students from secondary vocational education backgrounds. Our analysis uses propensity score matching to reduce selection bias and determine causal relationships. It also utilizes sensitivity analysis to check for the robustness of results. The findings reveal that, indeed, vocational students have lower rates of access and persistence than academic ones. Students who change fields between secondary and postsecondary education have the lowest persistence levels. We also found that vocational students have lower probabilities of access to higher education funding, and higher probabilities of enrolling in evening classes. Thus, when controlling for these two characteristics, we found that students who continue in the same vocational field between secondary and postsecondary levels had a better performance than students with an academic background. These findings may suggest that vocational students require greater support in order to increase their probabilities of success in higher education."

In response to this, we designed and tested a method for teaching reading literacy based on an adaptation of the Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) method, using inquiry-based teaching and information problem-solving on the Internet. The method was evaluated using a pre-experimental design with two experimental groups involving four teachers and 180 seventh-grade students in Chile. The data were collected using a class observation protocol and a set of tests to evaluate the students’ knowledge. The results show that the method is effective in enabling students to develop the skills of evaluating and reflecting on the contents and in improving the quality of teaching."

Using a quasi-experimental design, we tested a strategy to improve Chilean 10th graders’ skills for information problem solving using the Internet (IPS-I). The intervention was based on a workshop in which students learned IPS-I strategies and solved information problems using a customized Internet search software package. Results showed that members of the experimental group changed their search behavior and improved the quality of their products. However, no correlation between the number of search actions and product quality was found. Based on this, we highlight the potential of combining teaching strategies to improve specific search skills and the use of customized search tools with embedded functionalities that foster good search techniques."

To better understand this relationship, an investigation was conducted with 40 university students who solved 15 information problems of different levels of difficulty. During the students' problem-solving process, the think aloud protocol was used. The resulting data were coded to characterize the search actions and the answers were scored. The analysis was based on mean difference tests and correlations between actions and general results and by levels of difficulty. The results show that the students' performance is not related to the total number of actions, but it varies inversely proportional to the difficulty of the problem and that it is proportional to their difficulty. However, the distribution of the actions in the Internet search stages is heterogeneous, since it depends on the level and type of difficulty of the problem. These results contribute to understanding the process of solving information problems of different types, showing the need to analyze each stage considering the problems' difficulty. Likewise, they provide guidelines for the design of problems according to the expected learning."

To address this problem, researchers have developed models to structure the process. However, we maintain that it is first necessary to understand how students actually search for information online when solving an information problem and compare their behaviours with the available literature. To do this, we collected and analysed the data on a laboratory setting of 41 students while they solved 16 information problems using the internet and expressed aloud what they were thinking whilst solving them. We identified 21 categories of actions, grouped into 9 activity types associated with four information search processes, showing that some of the students’ stereotyped search behaviours are in fact conscious decisions based on the requirements of the task and the answers found. The results also show that searching for information on the internet can not only vary depending on the task’s requirements, but also on the number of iterations students need to perform to reach an answer. These findings provide some evidence that challenge the assumption that students simply lack the competencies to search for information on the internet; rather, it seems that they show an awareness of different strategies, which they decide to use based on the context and purpose of the task, making their search behaviour more elaborated and complex than is usually portrayed by researchers in the field. Based on this, implications and further research lines are also discussed."

Attempting to fill this gap, this paper presents a case study of 12 secondary teachers characterising their use of ICT in and out-of-the-classroom. Results show that teachers use these tools inside the classroom for presentations and support some instructional strategies and outside the classroom for lesson preparation, administration and communication, and design of students’ assignments with ICT. However, the analysis of the specific characteristics of these activities shows that beyond these apparently good purposes of ICT use, the quality of the characteristics of the activities is heterogeneous, which can have implications in the effectiveness of the use of ICT in teaching and learning. Based on this, we suggest that in order to take full advantage of the teaching and learning opportunities associated to use of digital tools in education, there is a need to develop teachers’ and students’ digital skills, specifically those associated to searching and selecting information available in the Internet, and developing and presenting information products."

This article analyses the notions of space, ritual and their link in the main studies carried out in the central-southern Andean area. First, we address the research in which the figure of verticality predominated when it came to understanding Andean space and, to a lesser extent, ritual activity. Then we analyse the works that incorporated the symbolic dimension and perspective in their analysis, understanding space as a symbolic projection of the Andean mentality and ritual activity as a practical manifestation of the principle of reciprocity. Thirdly, we approach studies belonging to the so-called ontological turn, which have given special importance to Andean space as a nonhuman entity with agency and to ritual activity as one of the particular ways in which humans relate to agents of various kinds. Finally, we make some general considerations, showing that there is a greater conceptual development of the notion of space and its derivatives in the studies, as opposed to the treatment of ritual activity and the relationships established between the two. We also identify an epistemological conflationism when it comes to explaining the functioning of both notions."

El Señor de los Milagros en Barcelona | KEYWORDS: migration; public space; urban culture | ABSTRACT: The procession of the Lord of Miracles is a massive religious manifestation ori-ginally from Peru, that has taken place during October in several cities around the world. The aim of this article is to analyze the relationship between this ritual manifestation (for the case of Barcelona) and the spatial reconfiguration that it involves, focusing specifically on the practice of dance. As a main methodological strategy, we use ethnography focused on the procession that took place in Barcelona (Spain) for the years of 2016, 2017 and 2018. Additionally, we conducted in-depth interviews with key informants, focus groups and we searched for documentary and historical information. Throughout the article, we show that the procession of the Lord of Miracles and the spatial reconfiguration that it entails are co-produced ritual phenomena. The procession would operate, consequently, as a mobile micro-landscape ritual, along with the ritualized manifestation of cultural differences and tensions."

From a qualitative perspective, a methodological exercise is presented that includes the use of documentary sources from the period known as Chileanization and ethnographic observation in contemporary classroom contexts (observations, group interviews, and in-depth individual interviews). This demonstrates that nationalism is present in our national education and still uses an assimilationist logic that facilitates the reproduction of forms of discrimination of a nationalistic, racial, and ethnic type."

Based on the results of the research, we show that, in a context of high rural-urban migration that characterizes the indigenous territories diagnosed as depopulated, kinship practices have played a central role in the configuration of a translocal identification of the population, revealing a specific sociocultural logic associated with the locality and its construction of alterities in the (trans)national border area."

It starts discussing the neoliberal governmentality as a political paradigm (Foucault). In this paradigm, one of the chief value is individual responsibility, where politics has as its task to normalise those that cannot adapt to that value. This normalisation is embedded in the practices which pertain public policies and social intervention. To shed light on these practices, the paper develops Foucault’s concept of dispositive. In this context, one of the main dispositive is risk factor theory. It arises from the concept of risk, and by means of an historical reconstruction of this notion, we show that this theory does not reconstruct a natural condition of some people; rather, it is a contingent selection used in the context of the neoliberal governmentality."

Considering an analysis of the most relevant literature in Chile on this religious movement, we will show how the specialized literature and the movement itself have shifted from foundationalist notions of community and subject, towards post-foundationalist notions of these concepts. Methodologically we have reviewed and analysed all the articles and books of sociology and anthropology of Pentecostalism published from 1967 to the present. We have encountered a crisis and religious disenchantment in the Pentecostal movement, and a weakening of the agglutinating force of the foundational notions of Pentecostalism. The Pentecostal movement is at a postfoundationalist moment, which we have tentatively called postpentecostalism."

Important reconfigurations in the Aymara evangelical movement have appeared as a result of the interaction between the evangelical movement and a settling characterized by a long Catholic and Andean tradition. This interaction has also affected many of its socio-cultural practices. Through the analysis of interviews with Aymara evangelicals in the region of Tarapacá, We describe and analyze the main cultural representations that have developed within this religious movement, paying especial attention to its concrete manifestations in the symbolic, ritual, identity and language levels."

Specifically, it is analysed the theoretical presuppositions in the concepts of community, subjects and its relationship, that take place in these researches during the period 1967-2012. Thus, four stages where elucidated. (1) In a first stage, pre (proto)-antropological, the pioneer researches highlighted that the pentecostal growing was based in the fact that the movement worked as a religious community. (2) In a second stage, the aymara pentecostalism was researched as a sect that was trying to destroy the aymara society (Holocaust). (3) In a third stage, the mapuche pentecostalism was understood as a process that implied at the same time a rupture and a continuity with the indigenous culture. (4) Finally, the researches of the aymara pentecostalism changed their holocaustic's position, turning the focus to the elements of continuity-discontinuity in the interaction between the pentecostalism and the local culture."

Nevertheless, current dominant discourses relate school libraries more closely to the demand to improve academic results. In this article, we explore what we consider to be an intensification of neoliberal discourses about school libraries by studying the case of the Learning Resource Centres (Centros de Recursos para el Aprendizaje, CRA) in Chile, a program that has been exemplary compared to other Latin American countries. With a Critical Policy Analysis (Bacchi 2009. Analysing Policy: What's the Problem Represented to be? Australia: Pearson, 2012. Engaging with Carol Bacchi. Strategic Interventions and Exchanges. Adelaide: University of Adelaide Press, 2015.

We focus on four public policy documents tracing how school libraries are related to the global educational reforms of the late 1980s and the 1990s and how they are assessed in the 2010s. We read the documents sketching out three exclusions that, we argue, lay the foundation for a neoliberal intensification of the CRA program: the exclusions of pedagogical innovation, of other learning resources beyond books, and of the local community."

Most educational resources available to students have been produced for and within a hearing community, privileging sound and written verbal materials over other ways of exchanging knowledge. In this practitioner piece, verbal texts produced in an oral and written culture are transformed in a visual storytelling workshop by a group of Deaf students. The alterations made to the ‘original’ text are traced in four stages, conceptualized here as transmediation, outlining the way the verbal text is transformed into Chilean Sign Language scripts, objects and characters, altering its structure and meaning. The authors aim to provide teachers and practitioners who work in diverse educational settings with ways of producing educational material through participation with students in creative ways."

The OECD-PISA reading framework has co-opted engagement as an attentive, involved, and joyful relationship with literature. A reading assemblage is offered to explain how engagement is instrumental to producing readers as bodies with potential for human capital, that is, children. The author uses a literary encounter to propose weird readings as an affect that breaks into the reading assemblage, complicating joy and pleasure, and as the affect that precludes the possibilities of creating relationships with materialities (books) from outside a reading assemblage."

To fill this gap, this article presents a systematic bibliographic review of 36 empirical articles that gather evidence on the work carried out with picture books grouped under the label of “radical” in educational contexts. “Radical books” are picture books that have some narrative sophistication (postmodern books), present themes that are unconventional in children's literature (disturbing) and are crossover or for all ages. The categorical inductive analysis reveals three important aspects: (a) that radical books are valued for their opening of gaps between picture and text, thus promoting the construction of diverse meaning in readers; (b) that research in this area focuses on the promotion of socio-emotional and critical literacy skills, and (c) that their use can open more symmetrical relationships between mediators and readers."

We present a school research intervention with students and in-service teachers in Santiago, Chile. In this study, we use The Island, a picturebook that produces a narrative of exclusion and fear, instead of promoting tolerance and conviviality. From a new materialist approach, we show engagements or makings of children and adults, sketching out how they defy simplistic ways of thinking and feeling about normative difference. We frame this study as a diffractive research-intervention in which the intertwined and productive relation ‘books and readers’ allow us to problematize rather than simplify what knowing/becoming/doing with arts may do to the production of difference within school contexts."

In this article, we conceptualize reading mediation as a ‘technology of affect’. We propose ‘mediation-as-usual’, a normative becoming of this technology, tasked with producing categories and identities regarding readers. Within this technology, adults are produced as empathetic, caring, and providers of safe spaces for reading. We report on literary encounters at a school in Santiago, Chile, with a ‘challenging’ picturebook. We were involved in the emergence of what we term ‘abject mediation’, a figuration that produces the limits and boundaries of mediation-as-usual, and, we argue, has transformative potential. However, this is an ephemeral figuration, as reterritorialization works to assimilate the border elements, actualizing mediation-as-usual. We discuss how these figurations may help to question normative ways of producing readers."

However, there is not yet enough research about the role that multimodal texts play in scaffolding student reading comprehension of complex scientific processes, such as energy transfer. This study explored how verbal and visual resources (scaffolding level) and individual differences (reading skills) contribute to science reading comprehension. One-hundred and sixty Chilean fifth-graders were assessed on reading skills, vocabulary, and prior science knowledge. A counterbalanced design was used to test two groups: Group 1 reads a text with low multimodal scaffolding and Group 2 reads a text with high multimodal scaffolding. Level of text scaffolding was determined by (1) image function, (2) visual-verbal relations, (3) presence of an explicit explanatory structure, and (4) lexico-grammatical resources. General monomodal and multimodal science reading comprehension were assessed with multiple-choice tests. An ANCOVA analysis revealed non-significant differences between groups after controlling for prior knowledge, fluency, and vocabulary. Likewise, a two-factor ANCOVA analysis showed that the high-multimodal scaffolding text significantly boosted science reading comprehension for low-skilled comprehenders. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for pedagogy and research, aiming to foster multimodal literacy for learning in content areas."

However, significant challenges remain for developers, specially regarding levels of continuous involvement by children, communication aspects with young children and the incorporation of children from minorities. In the present article the results of a systematized experience for adapting three multimodal digital books for deaf and hard of hearing (D/HH) children are presented and discussed. Four phases and corresponding methods are described. Level of involvement, impact of participation in development and relations between children and adults are presented and analyzed considering how participation changes depending on the phase, activities and project progress and constrains. Results are discussed using the concepts of epistemology, values of the research team, results and stakeholders."

Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile) has a complex societal and ecological history and marine resources have always been exploited; nevertheless, little is known about relationships between these resources and Rapanui islanders. This study aims to explore the historical and contemporary role of sea turtles on Rapa Nui, contrasting it with information from other Pacific region societies. We triangulated information through a literature review, semi-structured interviews, and participant observations. Our results show a strong cultural connection between Rapa Nui and other Pacific islands, with turtles represented in their art, culture, mythology, symbolism, popular traditions, and ritual and spiritual life. Use of these animals on Rapa Nui has varied historically, and nowadays turtle consumption is widely rejected among Rapanui community members. Currently, sea turtles have a crucial role in tourism, constituting an opportunity for local development, further knowledge, and conservation of natural heritage."

We designed a questionnaire and administered it to 1600 university-track high-school students in Chile. Using the data, we developed a comprehensive measure of higher-education knowledge using Item Response Theory and conducted multilevel regression analyses. The results show that, despite being low, the students’ level of knowledge on college is positively associated with higher-education enrollment. The most predictive dimension is information about programs and institutions, rather than costs and financial aid. Our results are relevant to the creation of fairer and successful trajectories to higher education."

We evaluate the degree to which the HSR program theory holds by exploring expectations, motivations, and college applications of students from low-performing schools. Using a survey (N = 1.831) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), we explore how high school students from low-academic contexts compare to peers from more advantageous settings regarding expectations and academic motivation associated with the HSR policy. Also, using regression discontinuity design (RDD), we analyze whether the reception of the HSR bonus raises the application rates of high-performing students from disadvantaged educational contexts. Our results show that although students from low-performing schools have higher expectations associated with HSR, they have lower levels of academic motivation and perform fewer actions to improve their HSR compared to their pairs from more advantageous school settings. Also, the HSR score bonus is not associated with improving college application rates of high-performing students from low-performing high schools. These results expand previous evidence on HSR using a comprehensive design that unveils the connection between socioeconomic and motivational variables in students’ behaviors, challenging the assumptions of a higher education equity initiative."

However, HS Ranking is considered as an admission criterion for all applicants, regardless of their contextual characteristics. In this study, we delve into how students from different high school settings interpret and deploy actions to increase their HS Ranking score. Through a Structural Equation Model with validated survey data (9 schools, N = 1.831), our results show that the role of the schools’ context in the deployment of academic strategies to increase HS Ranking score is significant, even after controlling for academic individual motivation. In a scenario of a highly segregated secondary system these results are relevant for the discussion of the role of HS Ranking – an equity-oriented admission policy – in maintaining the higher education inequalities."

This study explores persistence rates of students admitted through these programs using matching procedures and inferential analyses; in particular, logistic regressions and hazard models were conducted in a matched sampled based on students´ demographic characteristic. Although results vary slightly depending on the methodology used and the specific period of time under analysis, we observe non-statistically significant differences between students admitted by these programs and matched counterparts. These results are auspicious considering the different academic profile of students enrolled in higher education through equity access programs."

It is necessary to know the specific barriers that internal migrant students face in order to design policies and strategies for institutional support of these students. This article investigates the process of transition to university life for internal migrant students in Chile through an intervalidation process of two exploratory studies aimed at knowing about displacement and transition-to-university experiences from the perspectives of the migrants themselves. This collection of testimonies, and the subsequent identification of shared experiences among internal migrant students, highlights the triple rupture they experienced (change of city, place of study, and residence). According to their testimonies, students reported perceiving greater independence, self-regulation, and self-knowledge. This article discusses these topics and offers university policy orientations based on the findings, as well as aspects of these processes to explore in future research."

Initial results from the literature suggest a relationship between high-school advising and enrollment. This research explores students’ knowledge about higher education and the role that different actors play in the college-decision making process in Chile using mixed methods approach. Most respondents felt informed about higher education programs but felt only partially informed about financial aid, tuition costs, and labor outcomes. Results should inform policies aiming to increase access and persistence in higher education. Implications for literature on human capital and college-choice are discussed."

The intent is to employ this policy without sacrificing predictive validity of college success. This study explores the theory of action of the high school ranking policy, as well as the high school ranking's ability to predict students' persistence in higher education system and in Chile's higher education institutions using logistic regressions with fixed and random effects (intercepts) and country-wide data. The theory of action shows a main focus on access and a less intense emphasis on the goal of predicting academic success. The access goal is addressed through considerations during the admission process, and there are few efforts geared toward recruitment and graduation. Results also suggest that the high school ranking marginally helps predict college persistence at the institutional level, but only among students attending traditional universities. In light of results, it is recommended that traditional institutions keep working collaboratively to provide new admissions processes that are transparent, equitable, efficient and predict college success."

The financial aid policy for students in Chile has undergone major changes over the last decade, which has allowed individuals from usually underrepresented income groups to enroll in higher education institutions. This analysis combines information from four public administrative agencies, obtaining a sample of over 75 % of all high school graduates for the period 2007–2010. Methods include descriptive statistics, logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM). Both continuous persistence and reentry were studied at the system and at the institutional level for all four cohorts. Descriptive results show that short- and long-term dropout rates at the system level are high, and dropout rates are even higher at the level of institutions. Findings from the PSM show that the non-subsidized state loan is the instrument that displays the strongest correlation with persistence and it holds homogeneously across students from different socioeconomic groups. Among grants, we find consistently positive effects of need-based grants targeting low-income students attending technical institutions. We provide educational policy recommendations based on our findings."

Using a quasiexperimental research design based on a matching technique, the results show that compulsory voting does not have a significant impact on redistributive policies. Examining the experience of Latin America, where mandatory voting prevails along with high income inequality, the article argues that the empirical problem with Lijphart's argument lies in the implicit assumption that there is a programmatic linkage between politicians and voters. An alternative hypothesis is proposed, that the combination of high electoral participation and high inequality may be due to the prevalence of clientelistic linkage, frequent in democracies with weak institutions."

It presents a theoretical review of silence as a historical conception of childhood and child participation, and exposes the understanding of the construction of meanings from the constructivist perspective. As an initial approach and using a qualitative methodology, Philosophy Workshops were developed with 35 children from the fourth grade of Primary Education in Santiago, Chile. The production of dialogues was subjected to content analysis. The results indicate that children understand silence as a strategy to escape from difficulties and inhibited expression of negative emotions. The word is the expression of happiness and mutual cooperation, but at the same time, they mean it as a source of pain and the imposition of others. In conclusion, it is necessary to generate new modes of relationship between the child and adult world, with the focus on developing new knowledge about the perceptions and expectations of the children themselves, and their needs."

In this study we provide a detailed analysis of the meteorology and hydrogeomorphic response to the 51,6 mm in 6 hours of rain recorded in Alto Patache. In our control basin (7.2 Ha) we estimated a maximum erosion of ~1070 m3, which were partially stored in the distal alluvial fan, where we quantified 637 m3 of material. We estimated a mean water discharge of 11 m3 s-1 at the lower basin. The comparison between the meteorological and morphostratigraphical data allows us to define three phases that best characterize the anatomy of the 9A: Initial, Peak and End. We conclude that Alto Patache embraces an overall geomorphic stability that is interrupted recurrently by debris flows linkable to ENSO variability."

H. antisensis is currently distributed throughout the Peruvian Andes, northern Chile, western Bolivia and northwestern Argentina, between 1800 and 5500 m above sea level. V. vicugna is distributed throughout northern Peru and northwestern Argentina, in environments that exceed 3200 m above sea level. The archaeological record of deer antlers on the Atacama coast has previously been documented at the Caleta Huelén-42 site (21°S). In the case of V. vicugna, fibers have been recovered only at the coastal site of Camarones-14 (19°S). A dating of 4180 ± 20 year BP obtained from V. vicugna bone and indirect dating of the antlers suggest an early social exchange between groups from coastal regions and those from the Atacama Desert Mountain range, as well as encourage to the potential record of remains/products of these animals in areas far from their natural habitats."

Nevertheless, the archaeological record of seaweed burning is still limited to contexts where preservation is exceptional and macroscopic discrimination of charred remains is possible. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy in discriminating seaweed vs. plant/wood char. Our dataset (N = 92) consists of modern and archaeological seaweed and plant/wood charred remains, including specimens of unknown origin from the Atacama Desert coast, Northern Chile. The charred samples were processed to obtain 13 parameters which were then fed into five supervised machine learning models. The models, built on samples of known origin (seaweed and plant/wood), performed remarkably well in terms of accuracy, kappa, sensitivity, and specificity. The models were used for final predictions on 10 non-identified archaeological charcoals. Our results suggest that Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning techniques is a robust methodology for discriminating seaweed and plant/wood charred remains in the archaeological record. The predictions on unknown samples confirm that seaweed was used as fuel in a specific funerary ritual in the southern Atacama Desert coast around 5000 cal BP. Furthermore, charred specimens of Lessonia spp. recovered from combustion features in other northern Chile coastal settlements, suggest that seaweed pyrotechnology developed by Atacama Desert coast people is likely a long-term process. As for coastal archaeology, this work encourages new research on seaweed as an alternative/main fuel in coastal deserts and evaluates possible bias for chronologies from coastal archaeological settlements around the globe."

By examining the construction techniques, spatial organization, contents, and chronology of these architectures, we explore the technology of underground storage in the valleys and discuss the development of a community management system rooted in a process of productive intensification. We suggest that during the Late Intermediate Period, community storage in these settlements began in public spaces, as part of a local agricultural production management system, mostly of maize but supplemented with beans, tubers, and fish, driven mainly by populations living in the valleys and foothills. These local systems, centralization, and productive specialization around maize reached a peak during the Late period, because of the Inca political intervention, in parallel with the establishment of state storage systems in the foothills."

BP), is a social process and architectural phenomenon that attracts much of the attention of the archaeological research of Northern Chile. To delve into the unique characteristics of this period, an intrasite study of the Caleta Bandurrias site (Taltal) is presented. The analysis of different lines of evidence suggests activities, subsistence patterns, and technological organization of local hunter gatherer fishers inhabiting the area. The results, and their subsequent analysis within a context of regional settlement, suggest a residential-funerary use and/or social aggregation function of the site, as well as a particular type of advance towards the coast through a residential mobility strategy based on the availability of local resources and built environment."

878,2,"TITLE: The subjective texture of time. An exploratory and empirical approach to time perspectives in Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; individuals; subjectivity; Time; time perspectives | ABSTRACT: Time is a social and subjective construct that establishes qualitative differences in the flow of events, that is associated with an individual’s sociodemographic and cultural background, and that affects their attitudes and behavior. The relevance of the past, present, or future as well as the particular meaning of these temporal frames varies depending on each individual’s life experiences and social status. These qualitative and differentiated meanings of time have been studied in many countries through the concept of “time perspectives.” This paper presents the findings of the first application of Zimbardo’s Time Perspective Inventory in Chile and establishes correlations between its factors and sociodemographic and cultural variables. This paper aims to present comparable data for the study of time perspectives, provide theoretical and empirical evidence to progress in the study of the multidimensional nature of time in Chile, and discuss the possibilities and challenges posed by Zimbardo’s Time Perspective Inventory as an instrument for the empirical study of time."
879,2,"TITLE: Time Perspectives and Subjective Wellbeing in Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Subjective wellbeing; Subjectivity; Time; Time perspectives | ABSTRACT: The present article aims to provide evidence to advance in the comprehension of the multiple relationships between temporality and wellbeing by exploring the relationship between time perspectives and subjective wellbeing in Chile. In so doing, it presents a critical stand of the current operationalisations of the ‘balanced time perspective’ (BTP). This article supports the theoretical premise that individuals’ time perspectives possess a contextual nature and that the BTP is socially relative. As a result, the article proposes a novel method to define and operationalise BTP. Using data from the United Nations Development Programme’s 2011 Human Development Survey for Chile (N = 2,535), an empirical analysis is carried out on the relationship between time perspectives and vital satisfaction, positive affects, negative affects and depressive symptomatology scales. The results show that in Chile a negative orientation towards the past exerts the most significant effect on subjective wellbeing and malaise, and the time perspective which most favours subjective wellbeing in Chilean society is that in which there is a low orientation towards Present and Past-Negative, a high orientation towards Past-Positive, and a medium orientation towards Future. This relationship between time perspectives and subjective wellbeing constitutes an advance in the study of the subjective dimension of temporality in Chile, and contributes to the theoretical and methodological discussions on time perspectives on an international level."

In Chile, it has become one of the analytical frameworks most used by social scientists in the last decades to explain recent cultural changes of individuals and society. This article aims to characterize the field of reflections and the processes of individualization in Chile. First, it aims at constructing and analyzing the inter-disciplinary field of Social Sciences that has used the theory of individualization to understand recent cultural transformations. Second, it characterizes and describes the processes of individualization that would take place at individual and societal levels, discussing their possible contradictions and consequences. In the third place, it proposes a critical and constructive reading about the studies of individualization in Chile. Lastly, it recognizes the progress made so far and poses some challenges to think about future analyses of the cultural transformations of society and individuals in Chile from the standpoint of the theory of individualization."

An online cycle assessment is conducted to survey 14 students from a Chilean university by using a case analysis validated by expert judges. The results show the achievement of two competencies, diagnosis and intervention in psychology, having best performance in intervention. The entry and exit tests reveal that the majority (87.6%) of students have favorable expectations on their performances. The results show that content associated with developmental psychology, such as cognitive and affective development, should be reinforced. It is concluded that psychology degree programs and universities should improve the evaluation of competencies through authentic assessments, in addition to examining progressive achievements of graduate profiles, to accomplish high teaching quality standards."

From tax payments to passport requests, citizens have to interact with low-interactivity information artifacts such as reports, maps and datasets, among many others. Despite efforts to improve information delivery in the public sector, effective information usage remains a critical topic of action and research. The user experience of government documents has rarely been assessed, despite them being regularly published and frequently used. Considering this, the two following research questions arise: 1) How can government documents be classified (or grouped) in terms of user experience? 2) How can the user experience of government documents be monitored over time in order to inform design decisions? Working with a public agency in Chile, we develop and test a classification and monitoring framework based on two online surveys (N = 338 and N = 298). We then propose a framework for understanding user experience of government documents in these three dimensions: interaction goal, volume of information and ease of understanding. Using a graphical representation to classify user experience provides greater visibility of the current status of information produced by a public organization. Furthermore, by monitoring the user experience of a government document at different times, organizations can understand the effect of their design decisions and improve their service quality by implementing user-centered processes."

First, a characterization of the phenomenon and the causes that explain its criminal relevance is offered. After analyzing the conceptual conditions of a genuine instance of self-deception, its compatibility or incompatibility with the internal schemes of knowledge, recklessness and negligence, as levels of mens rea, is evaluated. In this regard, the following thesis is defended: Self-deception cannot be the basis for an imputation of knowledge or recklessness since it is a modality of dolus antecedens; however, its similarity with negligence is only structural and is not necessarily related to the deserving of punishment. In addition to this, a contrast between self-deception and willful blindness is also provided. Finally, the article closes with the selection and analysis of some possible relationships between self-deception and theoretical categories related to culpability."

To this end, first, the singularities that define the true cases of willful blindness are identified. Once the group of cases to be examined in this paper has been delimited, some of the main theses that propose to redirect them to dolus are presented and critically evaluated. After defending the common internal structure that negligence cases share with those of willful blindness, the next step is to highlight the distinctive features of the latter. More specifically, based on the characterization of willful blindness as a criminal instance of strategic ignorance, the greater preventability of the willfully ignorant defendant is argued. This leads to the conclusion that cases of willful blindness are a qualified form of negligence."

For such purposes, the method used is to examine separately and critically the main theses about the offended legal good, as well as the different interpretations offered in the Chilean doctrine on the scope that would have the clause “not being able but to know”, of article 456 bis A. As a result of the first point, the thesis defended is that receiving puts at risk the lawfully established markets, which is consistent with the status of economic crime that it may exhibit under Law 21.595. Regarding the second problem, it is concluded that the function of that clause is to operationalize an imputation of dolus ex re, the difficulties of which are illustrated by the cases of willful blindness."

After a brief critical review of theories that defend a unitary system, some weak points of the standard differentiation strategies will also be examined. On this basis, an alternative analysis model will be proposed. This proposal relies on two basic theses about the relationship between the modalities of criminal participation and the forms of subjective imputation: their categorical independence, and their pragmatic relationship. As a result of this analysis, the paper concludes by reaffirming the need for a differentiating model of criminal participation in negligent wrongful offences."

With this purpose, first, the structure and ground of negligence as an extraordinary imputation criterion will be briefly explained.

For this, first a brief historical overview of the crime will be presented, highlighting the theoretical reasons that have led to its elimination from Comparative law. Then, from a conceptual and normative perspective, the categories of gender violence, domestic violence, and femicide will be analyzed, as well as the manner in which they have penetrated the structure of article 390 of the Chilean Penal Code. From this, the critique of two aspects relative to subjects of this crime will be discussed: the indeterminacy of the notion of cohabiting partner and the increase in scope of the norm to include former spouses and former cohabitants. Lastly, other criminal policy considerations that discourage a further expansion of the crime will be reviewed."

However, we know little about how the factors that influence college completion among older students differ from their younger peers. We aim to identify features of institutional contexts in which adult community college students are more likely to prosper, as evidenced by an elevated likelihood of graduating. Methods: Using a multilevel statistical approach to analyze administrative data for Ohio’s community colleges, we examine how associations between students’ age and their likelihood of graduating differ as a function of dosage-weighted exposure to six contextual characteristics that align with the organizational, human aggregate, and socially constructed dimensions of Strange and Banning’s (2015) socioecological framework for campus environments. Results: Contrary to expectations, we find more similarities than differences between older and younger students in how exposure to particular institutional characteristics is related to the likelihood of graduating. Only one of the six characteristics has a relationship of meaningful magnitude with the likelihood of graduating among students of any age. Specifically, exposure to classmates taking heavier course credit loads is positively related to the likelihood of graduating for students 40 years of age and older. Conclusion: Our findings point to two potential levers for strengthening outcomes of older students as community colleges seek to become adult-serving not just adult-enrolling. First, incentivize a full-time course load across the student population. Second, create opportunities for adult students, many of whom attend part-time, to take classes with a range of classmates, including younger classmates and classmates who are attending full-time."

Age and Gender Differences in How Students Build Momentum toward College Graduation | KEYWORDS: Adult; Age; Community college; Completion; Gender; Graduation; Momentum | ABSTRACT: Do older community college students build momentum toward graduation differently than their younger peers? One-third of students in community colleges are 25 years of age or older, and these students tend to have lower rates of graduation than their younger peers. Yet, we know little about how the factors that influence college graduation differ across the wide range of ages found among community college students. Using multilevel statistical models to analyze data for Ohio’s community colleges, we investigate how the relationships between early academic momentum and the likelihood of completing a postsecondary credential vary by age. We disaggregate results by gender in light of prior evidence of differences in the educational experiences and outcomes of adult men and women. The measures of momentum, all observed in the first year in community college, include credits earned, credit success rate, enrollment continuity, passing college-level math, and passing college-level English. The college graduation outcomes, observed over six years, include earning a postsecondary certificate, earning an associate degree from a community college, and earning a baccalaureate degree from a four-year institution. We find some differences and some similarities in how older and younger students build momentum toward a postsecondary credential, and how these patterns differ for men and women, revealing fruitful opportunities to strengthen the outcomes of older students."

Understanding the current revival of these policies is particularly important as it positions higher education as a social right or public good challenging the predominant discourse that situates higher education as a private good. Chile, a country often characterized as a neoliberal laboratory, implemented a free-tuition policy in 2016 and offers a case study to understand the policy formation and the political dynamics behind it. Based on the advocacy coalition framework and using discourse network analysis and in-depth interviews, this paper focuses on identifying the main actors involved in the policy discussion, their beliefs about free college in Chile, and how they interact during the policy development. Findings show that the Chilean free tuition policy was the result of the joint actions of actors who shared similar beliefs and formed coalitions to try to influence the policy design. Findings also highlight the formation of two opposite coalitions that were able to introduce their beliefs into the policy design at political and technical levels. Implications for policymakers and researchers are discussed."

However, response rates and nonresponse bias are still issues of concern. Using a factorial randomized control trial design, this study explores whether different communication emails affect response rates, representativeness, and response bias in a web survey of doctoral students enrolled in a U.S. university. A total of 5,539 doctoral students were stratified and randomly assigned to one of six groups. Results showed that none of the interventions increased the overall response rate. Moreover, interventions affect the representativeness of the sample and are associated with response bias."
893,0,"TITLE: Developmental trajectories during doctoral study: identifying heterogeneity in psychosocial factor’s development | KEYWORDS: developmental trajectories; Doctoral education; doctoral student socialization; group-based trajectories; self-determination theory | ABSTRACT: Despite their importance to the research enterprise, doctoral students are an underexamined population in higher education. Several studies have emphasized the importance of psychosocial characteristics in academic success and scholarly identity formation. However, few studies have explored their developmental trajectories across a range of disciplines to give an overall perspective of the scholarly identity formation process and its nuances. We argue that doctoral education is a socialization process that, if successful, helps doctoral students to develop a disciplinary identity. We propose that this identity development process is mediated by how students internalize their socialization experiences. Therefore, we integrate concepts from self-determination and identity development theory into socialization theory. Using a three-year longitudinal sample at a single institution (n = 1264), we identify doctoral students’ developmental trajectories in perceptions of competence, autonomy, relatedness, knowledge, and recognition. We identify six different developmental groups according to baseline levels and developmental trajectories during the first two years of doctoral studies. Further, we find that sex, family income background, and anticipatory socialization experiences are associated with membership in these groups. Lastly, we observe that these trajectories are associated with socialization outcomes. Findings highlight a non-monolithic socialization process that calls for a systematic approach to measure these psychosocial characteristics over time. Implications for theory, research, and practice are discussed."

This study aims to investigate the demographic characteristics of graduate students participating in co-curricular professional development (PD) and sociocultural development (SD) programming at a graduate college at a large, selective and research-intensive public university in the Midwestern USA. Design/methodology/approach: Using institutional data from six semesters, the authors examined the characteristics of students that attended the graduate college’s programs at one university. The authors analyzed which students were most likely to attend PD and SD programs using multinomial logistic regression models. Findings: Female students, students from US historically marginalized racial groups, and US Pell Grant recipients (low-income students) were found to have a higher likelihood of attending both PD and SD programs at the centralized graduate college. Practical implications: The findings will be of interest to graduate deans and educators who support graduate students. Further evaluative research on the usefulness of such programs at other institutions would help graduate colleges better understand the role they play in meeting graduate students’ needs. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the understanding of the important role of the US graduate college in the development of graduate students. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first study to evaluate the backgrounds of graduate students who pursue co-curricular PD and SD opportunities."

Design/Approach/Methods: We conducted this study in two stages. We worked with one semester learning management systems (LMS), library, and students’ records data in the first one. We performed a k-means cluster analysis to identify groups with similar usage patterns. In the second stage, we invited students from emerging clusters to participate in group interviews. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze them. Findings: Three groups were identified: 1) digital library users/high performers, who adopted deeper approaches to learning, obtained higher marks, and used learning resources to integrate materials and expand understanding; 2) LMS and physical library users/mid-performers, who adopted mainly strategic approaches, obtained marks close to average, and used learning resources for studying in an organized manner to get good marks; and 3) lower users of LMS and library/mid-low performers, who adopted mainly a surface approach, obtained mid-to-lower-than-average marks, and used learning resources for minimum content understanding. Originality/Value: We demonstrated the importance of combining learning analytics data with qualitative methods to make sense of digital technology usage patterns: approaches to learning are associated with learning resources use. Practical recommendations are presented."

Displaced Puerto Rican high schoolers incurred the transitional costs of forced migration at a time in their educational trajectories when they are formulating their postsecondary plans. While student mobility is not uncommon, prevailing college choice models do not account for changes in context. This embedded case study leverages 87 interviews across district stakeholders, including 10 high schoolers to examine whether and how changes in educational contexts (state policy, postsecondary landscape, and schools) influenced changes in postsecondary expectations through the lens of expectancy-value theory. First, Florida’s policy context (as an English-only state with English-only testing) created a challenging environment for students to acquire diplomas, which reduced students’ expectations for success. Second, the enrollment patterns and institutional costs were vastly different between Puerto Rico and Florida; Florida counselors were unprepared to help students consider postsecondary options in Puerto Rico and emphasized utility and low cost of community college. Third, class mattered, as students from higher socio-economic backgrounds were less likely to change their educational expectations, relative to the downward shifts in expectations of low-SES students. We close with implications for college guidance, policy, and research."

A quantitative analysis was carried out, including descriptive analysis of contingency tables, chisquared tests, t-tests, and multiple linear regressions. The results showed that the use of the library by undergraduate students did not follow a common pattern and instead varied across disciplines. The article also shows that access to digital resources does not replace the use of print materials."

Results show that the access to electronic resources has a greater impact upon performance than the number of library items borrowed. They also show that an increase in the number of sessions dedicated to accessing electronic resources was accompanied by a decrease in the number of library items borrowed as students progress in their degrees. Further analyses showed that students’ behavior is attributed more to the requirements of advanced courses (commonly encountered in later years of their degrees) than to personal preferences. This relationship between student records and library services enlightens the impact of different library resources on student learning and offers evidence to rationalize library investments according to their needs and impacts."

This framework is adapted and expanded to the field of university governance taking into consideration the specialized literature on models of governance in higher education, and with the aid of data obtained from interviews of former university leaders with whom we discussed their experiences as university officials. Our typology consists of six forms of legitimacy: traditional, which distinguishes two forms, academic and administrative; rational-bureaucratic, which also has two modalities, managerial and legalistic, and finally, the political and charismatic forms. To stress the differences across these types of legitimacy, and try out a possible translation of them into designs amenable to empirical research, we also present an operationalization of the typology into variables and hypotheses."

To this end, a review was made of the historical evolution of brass bands in the Norte Grande de Chile and field work was done with that band. In addition, archaeological, ethnohistorical and ethnographic data dealing with the association between music and ritual in religious ceremonies of the Central-South Andes from pre-Hispanic times to the present were considered. It is argued that through their musical practices, the Andean brass bands participate in the continuity and change of a framework of musical, devotional and spatio-temporal relationships, of identities and collective memories, which persist from pre-Inca times and have tenaciously incorporated recent sounds and devotions. These practices interweave versatility, tradition and modernity in correspondence relationships, as we will review for the case of Alcones del Folklore, during the festivity of Espíritu Santo, in the town of Jaiña (Tarapacá, Norte Grande de Chile), the years 2014 and 2015."

This un-intuitive pattern is relevant for policy and research, but it has seldom been explored in the populations of developing countries. In this study, we use SES groups of equal relative size to compare mortality rate ratios by age for eight samples in the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) that contain mortality and household assets data (El Salvador 1992, Rwanda 2002, Senegal 2002, Sierra Leone 2004, Uganda 2002, Malawi 2008, Brazil 2010, and Zambia 2010). Seven samples show the same results as those found in developed countries: SES morality rate ratios consistently decrease with age."

Here, we evaluate if inhibitory processes play a specific role in the particular case of fraction comparison, where learners must ignore the potentially misleading information provided by the natural numbers composing fractions (e.g. 2/3 > 4/7 despite 2 < 4 and 3 < 7). To do this, we presented a sample of Chilean children (N = 450) from 5th, 6th, and 7th grade with a numerical comparison task tapping inhibitory and other processes. Results showed that both general math achievement and accuracy in comparing fractions were significantly predicted by inhibition. The former association, however, turned out to mediate the latter one. Another process, related to visual priming, predicted children’s likelihood to answer fraction comparison items focusing exclusively on the fraction components. This relation was, furthermore, not mediated by general math achievement. Altogether, these findings shed light on the mental processes underlying the early stages of the learning of fractions."

Destruction, Creation, and Precariousness of Verticalized Space | KEYWORDS: Housing; Urban development; Urban renewal | ABSTRACT: This chapter situates urbicide as an intentional process that requires the devastation of the public, the destruction of the private and domestic, to decompose the urban structure and the city, generating a (re)production of urban space, in some cases precarious. This interpretation logic situates verticalization processes and their “precarious” expression as a spatialization of urbicide. Beyond its identification and documentation, it provides patterns of localization, diversification, and even intensification in contemporary urban production that transcend the city of Santiago de Chile, expressing a process of recursive urbicide in the logic of production of urban space. This methodology is structured in two main parts using quantitative methods. The first focuses on the analysis of the evolution of verticalization in the Santiago Metropolitan Area (AMS), explained through three hypotheses. The second develops the argument of how verticalization has transcended from precarious areas and communes to precarious silos, a new way of understanding the precariousness of affordable high-rise housing. We use the building permits for new construction and regularization of new construction of high-rise buildings of more than nine floors (National Institute of Statistics, INE) to construct the evolution of verticalization and its transition towards precariousness with an index in the AMS from 1990 to 2019."

To overcome these problems, people display strategies which allow them to maximize their times; taking advantage of their personal capabilities and the opportunities offered by the spaces that they must cover. The present paper has the objective to portray people's daily mobility practices of a mixed used land space in the city of Santiago de Chile (Plaza de Mai-pú), considering the problems which came from social constructions and the family. To achieve the objective, the paper analyzes experiences from inhabitants of Plaza de Maipú's surroundings which shows how the same space can have different meanings and functions."

The aim of this descriptive study is to explore the self-perception of the development of sustainability competences in secondary education students and its relationship with gender. A questionnaire was administered to 372 students from 5 secondary education schools in Tarragona (Spain). The results show a good level of self-perception of sustainability competences, with significant differences between men and women, mainly in attitudes and behaviors in sustainability. This study can inform the design of curricula and the development of educational strategies for sustainability."

However, the emergence of new theoretical approaches has resulted in the identification of a problem: organizing and describing the necessary professional knowledge to teach stochastics. Objectives: The aim of this research is to characterize the didactic-stochastic knowledge needed for pre-service mathematics teachers, considering Chile as a case study. Design: Following a qualitative perspective, through a content-analysis. Setting and Participants: The Pedagogical and Disciplinary Standards for Mathematics Teaching Programs. Data collection and analysis: The national guidelines on the stochastic education of pre-service’ teachers were analysed to collect text fragments describing professional knowledge expected in pre-service teachers. Results: We obtained a set of 37 indicators organized according to the Didactic-Mathematical Knowledge Model, which includes disciplinary aspects (stochastic content), the knowledge of students and their learning (cognitive content) and interests (affective content), instruction processes (interactional and mediational content) and their link with the educational context and other knowledge areas (ecological content). Conclusions: We hope that the identified indicators become a useful tool to organize and evaluate stochastic education programs for pre- and in-service teachers. Moreover, we highlight the replicability of the method uses and the possible adaptation of results to other educational contexts."

Because professional practice of Primary Education prospective teachers regarding to statistical education will depend on their statistical reasoning, an evaluation is considered necessary to indicate whether an educational reinforcement in their current training is relevant. In this work, statistical literacy is evaluated through the analysis of transnumeration in a sample of 653 prospective teachers of Primary Education. For this purpose, five news extracted from different media containing information represented by simple statistical graphs that present biases are provided and the information is requested to be represented in three different ways to facilitate its interpretation: a table, another type of graph and another representation of the data. The results show a great transnumerative capacity from the graphic to the tabular format (underlining that no new information is extracted in this procedure), a limited ability to change the representation from a graphic to another type of graphic and an almost null ability to determine other different ways of synthesizing the information shown. These findings emphasize the relevance of an educational reinforcement that helps these future professionals to understand the intuitive representations that facilitate the understanding of the information and make the change between the available data presentation options, highlighting the statistical information present in these."

On some occasions, this information includes statistical graphs that contain biases. Therefore, it is essential that citizens develop adequate knowledge, skills and attitudes in order to adopt a critical attitude before accepting them as true. For this reason, framed in the theoretical framework of civic statistics, errors made by 305 students from four different Compulsary Secondary Education schools when interpreting biased news media items that included graphs were analysed. Neither of the two news items took into account the size of the population, which could lead to erroneous conclusions. It was concluded that a large proportion of the subjects surveyed assume the information they receive to be true, without first criticising it. In addition, they are not able to interpret certain graphics and they also have difficulties in understanding that the context of the news item may be essential for drawing accurate conclusions about it. Knowing about these errors will be fundamental in order to be able to work on them later, with special emphasis on the most common ones, and thus form statistically literate citizens."
912,1,"TITLE: Gender perspective in attitudes towards probability and its teaching in pre-service Chilean teachers Perspectiva de género en actitudes hacia la probabilidad y su enseñanza en futuro profesorado chileno | KEYWORDS: Affective domain; Gender perspective; Probability; Teacher’s training | ABSTRACT: Considering that promoting a positive disposition towards probability and statistics has been established as one of the priority goals of the reformist movement regarding their teaching in schools, this study adopts a gender perspective to address the objective of analyzing attitudes towards probability and its teaching in a sample of 269 pre-service Chilean mathematics teachers. Through a quantitative methodology and with a descriptive scope, statistical differences are identified between the attitudes declared by female and male participants based on the assumed theoretical perspective. The results generally reflect positive attitudes both among future female teachers and future male teachers. However, attitudes were significantly more positive in the male group regarding their feelings of liking towards probability and the tendency to use the content to solve problems when appropriate. The study concludes with a discussion of the proposed goals in contrast to previous literature and projects the findings as input to consider affective aspects in the initial training of teachers responsible for teaching probability in schools, as well as the inclusion of a gender perspective in a comprehensive manner throughout this process."

This paper examines the reliability and construct validity of the Scale of Attitudes towards the Content of Descriptive Statistics and its Teaching (EAEDE), with two samples: a pilot sample made up of 126 pre-service Chilean and Spanish mathematics teachers; and another with 269 pre-service Chilean mathematics teachers. Following a descriptive-correlational quantitative methodology, we analyze the reliability and construct validity of the EAEDE. The results indicate adequate psychometric characteristics of the scale and, a better fit for the theoretical distribution of the items. This research can be the basis for future analysis on teacher attitudes that require the use of the scale."

Since the early 1980s, comprehensive neoliberal policies have reshaped Chilean society. During this period, teachers were described as an absent subject. However, in 2014 dissident teachers spontaneously asserted themselves against a new TCP inaugurating the teachers’ spring, which in 2015 involved a 57-days strike, and again 50 days in 2019. Using the Foucauldian notion of subjective limits, I present the results of a study based on a narrative approach to understand the formation of a dissident subjectivity among Chilean teachers. I conducted 35 interviews with ten leaders and eight grassroots teachers of seven different dissident teachers’ organizations. The findings focus on analyzing political-pedagogical dissent as the central discourse mobilized by teachers to disrupt the new TCP. This discourse enables dissident teachers to clarify the current limits of their work, allowing a set of experimental practices to unfold. Finally, I discuss the emergence of a dissident teacher’s subject as a case that evokes and illustrates how new forms of political subjectivities enable us to understand the current crisis of neoliberalism experienced in Chile."

The university-school relationship may be read under this principle where there is a subject of knowledge (academic knowledge), and an object of knowledge (teachers and school knowledge). More specifically, we connect the problem of the (de)coloniality of power and knowledge with science education through a work of epistemic care. The case of CIDSTEM-PUCV is presented as an experimental center that challenges the traditional role of research by including the epistemic and cultural diversity that exists in schools and its communities. We reflect on the challenges of a decolonial and Latina science education capable of recognizing the plurality of knowledge with which it is related."

The school has in this approach the position of implementation. However, it is possible to think that, according to its own necessities and possibilities, a process of creative translation (re-contextualisation) of the diverse educational policies that circulate in a particular school takes place. The teachers’ meeting, the formal place where the professionals of a school meet, is a privilege space to study this process of policy re-contextualisation. Based on six years (2012-2018) of ethnographic work in three nonselective public school in Chile, this paper analyses the intense work done in two of these schools during the years 2012 – 2014. The main purpose is to shed light on the definitive closure experienced by one of these schools at the end of 2016. Considering the perceptions that teachers and managers had about the teachers’ meetings as a boring and tedious space, we elaborates on two subjective positions, the managers’ monologue and teachers’ silence. Both positions give an account of the way in which education policy is enacted, a way characterised by a subjective split that hinders the possibilities of a reflective dialogue."

The logic that education policy in Chile has taken to achieve this goal is based largely on the design and implementation of assessment programs leading directly or indirectly to individual economical incentives. However, how aligned are the assumptions of these programs with what actually encourages teachers to do their job? The performance of four focus groups and six semi-structured interviews give rise to the main finding of this study: there are four cores that encourage teachers' professional job. With this, they attribute a negative sense to both performance evaluation programs and individual economic incentives programs. These results allow discussing the economistic and culturalist assumptions underlying assessment programs and economic incentives in Chile."

Studies show that teacher motivation is related to the intention to leave the teaching profession, but there is a lack of studies that to research the relationships according to latent motivational profiles. Therefore, the objective of the study is to determine the influence of teaching motivational profiles on the intention to leave the teaching profession in a sample of Chilean school system teachers. Method. 310 teachers who graduated from a Chilean university participated in the study. Latent profile analysis and one-way ANOVA test were used to assess the motivational profiles and differences in intention to leave. Results. The results support the fit of a model of four teacher motivational profiles: low quality (n = 16), high quantity (n = 89), low quantity (n = 82) and high quality (n = 123). Furthermore, teachers grouped in the profiles with the highest degrees of autonomy for teaching presented the lowest levels of intention to leave the profession. Discussion and Conclusion. It is inferred that teacher motivational profiles influence the intention to leave the teaching profession. More specifically, it is concluded that the teachers grouped in the motivational profiles with greater degrees of autonomy to carry out teaching work show less intention to leave the teaching profession."

The aim of the study was to assess the mediating role of the types of regulation that compose the autonomous motivation, in the relation among the perception of autonomy support, academic satisfaction and academic performance perceived by university students. The participants were 229 first-year students from four Chilean universities. The mediating effect was assessed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. The results indicated that both the intrinsic regulation and the identified regulation partially intervene the effect of the perception of autonomy support on academic satisfaction, but only the intrinsic regulation totally intervenes the effect on the academic performance. It is concluded that the types of autonomous regulation are mechanisms through which it is positively influenced the well-being and academic achievement of university students."

The study was conducted on 531 student-teachers from the 2009 cohort. This is a quantitative and non experimental study of a longitudinal nature and an explanatory research design. To collect the data a secondary data analysis was used and the data were later analysed by the survival analysis method and modelled by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The findings show that the individuals variables that explain student-teachers' drop-out rates correspond to the gender and place of origin (Bío-Bío región). On the other hand, the academics variables that explain student-teachers' drop-out rates correspond to the secondary education grade point average, place in the list of selected, secondary education with a scientific and humanities oriented curriculum, total signed up courses, latest academic grade point average and withdrawal from university. It is concluded that the abilities associated with the level of achievement of academic results and social support for students, management constitute important aspects to keep the commitment to stay in school academic program. To the extent that management skills and support are positive, students will have favorable interactions that will support their participation at the institutional level, which promote intellectual and academic development. Finally, it is concluded that the level of institutional policy is relevant to manage the support of the abilities and the adaptation of students as they will contribute in creating a positive balance between academic and social integration, from the configuration of elements they support the development of a context of motivation which will maintain the commitment of students achieving the goal of graduation."

In a context of a strong massification of higher education, the experience of students whose parents completed secondary education at most has turned into a field of emerging interest. Depending on the objectives, the following research was approached from a constructivist paradigm and designed according to the biographical method, whose principal data collecting technique was the use of semi-structured interviews. The results of this exploratory study show that the building up of a university education project is greatly influenced by parents, who turn into an fundamental source of support. In the same way, students configure three relevant meanings to their university experience: upward social mobility, vocation and gratitude to parents. Finally, the results are discussed and new questions are proposed."

This research is a quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional study. To collect the data required, a survey was developed, which was applied to 38 students with disability. The main results reveal a high retention rate of students, who exhibit a positive perception of their inclusion in their university life and also a high level of satisfaction with most of the services provided. Seven out of ten students surveyed recognize having received some sort of education care from their programs to pursue their studies. However, there still exists a lack of connection between the current initiatives developed at the university to support the enrollment and permanence of students. Added to this fact, there is a lack of protocols and training for teachers and staff. In this study it is proposed that the university must establish a management system that defines objectives, strategies and actions that contribute to improve inclusion of people with disabilities."

We used the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI), and Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSMI) in three drought-prone regions: Sonora (Mexico), Maipo (Chile), and Mendoza-Tunuyán (Argentina) to study their temporal interdependence. For this evaluation we use precipitation, temperature, and streamflow data from gauges that are managed by governmental institutions, and satellite-based soil moisture from the ESA CCI SM v03.3 combined data set. Results confirm that effective drought monitoring should be carried out (1) at river-basin scale, (2) including several variables, and (3) considering hydro-meteorological processes from outside its boundaries."

This study aimed to analyze the association between multimorbidity and all-cause mortality in a representative sample of the Chilean population. This longitudinal study used data from 3701 subjects aged ≥15 years who participated in the Chilean National Health Survey conducted between 2009 and 2010. We included 16 self-reported highly prevalent morbidities. All-cause mortality data from an 11-year follow-up were collected from the Chilean Civil Registry. The Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for confounders, determined the association between multimorbidity categories and all-cause mortality. Of the total sample, 24.3% reported no morbidity, while 50.4% two or more. After adjustment, participants with four or more morbidities had a 1.66 times higher mortality risk [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–2.67] than those without morbidities. The mortality risk increased by 10% for each additional morbidity [HR: 1.09 (CI: 1.04–1.16)]. Multimorbidity was common in the Chilean population and increased the mortality risk, which greatly challenges the health system to provide an integral and coordinated approach to healthcare."

INVESTIGACIÓN HIDROGEOLÓGICA DEL ACUÍFERO DEL PAINE CONSIDERANDO LAS CONDICIONES DE REFERENCIA DE 1970 Y EL ANÁLISIS A LARGO PLAZO DE 1990 A 2020. | KEYWORDS: Groundwater resources; Mega-drought; Paine aquifer; temporal analysis | ABSTRACT: Groundwater resources are vital for meeting the world's freshwater needs, providing the primary source of drinking water for nearly half the global population, and are particularly important for agriculture and industry in dry regions. The Paine Basin, situated south of Santiago, Chile, has been heavily affected by an extended mega-drought, influencing water availability for various uses. Yet, comprehensive hydrogeological studies to understand the aquifer system and establish a baseline for future actions in the basin to better manage water resources have been lacking. Therefore, this study investigates the aquifer's conditions in 1970, considered closest to its undisturbed state. It uses water table and chemical data to discern groundwater flow directions and the relationship between the river and the aquifer. Subsequent temporal analyses using Mann-Kendall tests and Theil-Sen slope estimation on DGA well-level data aim to statistically verify the significance of water level declines. The findings confirm an east-to-west groundwater flow, corroborated by chemical signatures linking the Paine waters to the Maipo River, suggesting river recharge from the aquifer during that era. However, recent trends indicate a significant drop in water levels since the mega-drought began in 2010, not aligning with the increase in groundwater extractions starting in 2005. The above highlights that additional water sources, such as river infiltration or irrigation return flow, need to be considered to explain water level variability, which highlights the hydrology of the basin. Finally, trend analysis over the last 30 years indicates that hydrodynamic conditions have changed since the initial conditions were considered in 1970."
935,0,"TITLE: The Chilean Curriculum: Historical Configuration of Walls of Exclusion El Currículo Chileno: Configuración Histórica de Muros de Exclusión | KEYWORDS: Actors; Curriculum; Education; Policy; Social justice | ABSTRACT: In Chile, the education policies of the last 50 years have been configured as a hegemonic space for interventionism by national groups and pro-neoliberal international organisations. Under the promise of improved efficiency and quality of the education system, school communities have been aligned through constant control. Because of its strategic character, the school curriculum, in its design, implementation and evaluation, has been a key part of the latter task. This article aims to reveal the networks, links and milestones of this trajectory from a perspective of reflexive and historical-critical analysis with the objective of identifying the contradictions of design in what has been catalogued as a neoliberal laboratory-device in Latin America. For this purpose, a methodological procedure of socio-historical reconstruction is adopted, based on the latest documents generated around the phenomenon of Chilean education, allowing us to focus on the devices of control and assurance of an intentional continuum in the observed period that transcends the political option. The results and the analysis of the consequences of this process reveal that the curriculum functions as the central element of intervention and the axis of understanding of the implementation of a social system that ends up configuring an education that has become an engine of segregation, an issue that is also visible in the perpetuation of socially and educationally marginalised groups."

The article presents the contemporary problems facing governance in Latin America. The paper demonstrates that the fissures that weaken institutional and democratic stability in the region respond to a set of aspects subordinate to the crisis of expectations regarding the permanent promise of economic development. Methods and materials. The research problem was based on Leonardo Morlino’s theory of democratic unanchoring. We indicate that the objective of the work is to show five explanatory variables of the erosion of democracy, based on the historian’s classic documentary methodology. Analysis. Fundamentally, it shows 1) the high level of disaffection and discomfort with the political classes; 2) the risk of a new wave of populism and authoritarianism; 3) the implications of poor economic performance post-pandemic; 4) the repercussions of high rates of insecurity, violence, and organized crime; and 5) the problems in achieving regional integration and relevant global participation. Results. The picture of the Latin American situation raises critical knots in its democratic governance, which deserve to be reviewed in depth in order to recognize relevant lines of action for researchers, decision-makers, and public policy managers. The answer to the problems of democratic governance in Latin America can be found in the thesis of political, economic, and social delegitimization in the processes of lack of efficiency in the administration of the democratic regime in the last fifty years, beyond the factors of historical inheritance or global conjuncture. Authors’ contributions. Pedro Martínez Lillo determined the basic concept of the article as well as formulated and analyzed the main results of the study; Javier Castro Arcos prepared the structural composition of the study and analyzed the methodological foundations of the study."

Given the participation of Ukrainian ultranationalist militias and Russia’s goal of de-Nazifying Ukraine, a need emerges to provide a greater understanding of hypernationalism and its relation to this war’s origins. By going back to John Mearsheimer’s 1990 article ‘Back to the future: Instability in Europe after the Cold War’, this article examines Mearsheimer’s idea of hypernationalism and the problem of how states can signify other nations most negatively in the run-up to war. Drawing on a problem-driven strategy, it tackles this problem by applying ‘Essex School’ poststructuralist discourse theory. It argues that Ukrainian hypernationalism played a vital role in the genesis of this war, although not as a stable set of principles that possess a causal force but as a political subjectivity that the Russian government signified as a threat to its national identity. I use this distinction to theorise the role of hypernationalism by examining Russian official statements about Ukrainian neo-Nazism."

By drawing on post-Marxist discourse theory, I propose applying the ontology of discourse and the instability of objects. First, the empirical-positivist creed on the causality of objects is deconstructed to question that the mainstream does not account for the agency power of Latin American states. Instead, I propose the international practice category to understand how China and Latin American states articulate their bilateral relations politically. Taking Chile-China relations as a case study, declassified diplomatic sources are analysed in three relevant historical moments. It is argued that, rather than being determined by the cause of material factors or shared ideas, these countries engaged politically to set the symbolic terrain of the bilateral relationship at each historical juncture. The empirical analysis shows how Chile and China articulated their practices through political convergences and divergences on issues crucial to their respective foreign policies."

The athletes’ strategies, which included insulin dose adjustments, carbohydrate intake, and monitoring techniques, were analyzed using a collaborative autoethnographic approach and data from medical and running devices. The athletes, two males and one female, used various technologies such as Supersapiens, Freestyle Libre, and the Medtronic Minimed 780G insulin pump to manage their diabetes during the marathon. Despite individual challenges, all three athletes successfully completed the marathon. The study presents the strategies, glycemic data, and major highlights using visual narratives, providing valuable insights into the experiences of athletes with T1D during endurance events. These narratives effectively communicate the challenges faced by athletes with T1D and can help optimize diabetes management during endurance events."

Previous studies use a dNBR threshold to determine the presence of burned areas, but this threshold is affected by vegetation variability determined by the geography of the study area and land use coverage. For them, the difference in the normalized index of burned areas (dNBR) was used to study the mega fires that affected the central zone of Chile in the summer of 2017. An automated methodology was developed that, based on satellite images and polygons of the burned areas provided by the National Forestry Corporation of Chile (CONAF) generates a set of dNBR thresholds differentiated by administrative region and land use. The application of differentiated dNBR thresholds significantly improves the accuracy of the burnt area delimitation model, although it does not achieve satisfactory results for all land uses. This methodological advance will make it possible to improve the design and control of policies for the prevention, conservation and restoration of ecosystems affected by forest fires."

This study explored personality traits in athletes of a growing sport, trail or mountain ultrarunning, a group for which previous studies have yielded inconclusive results regarding the dominant traits and which traits are associated with sporting success. The NEO-FFI questionnaire by Costa and McCrae (1992) was applied online to a sample of 86 trail runners (60 men and 26 women), who participated in a competition in Chile. It sought to determine what the personality profile of these athletes was like; to identify if there were significant differences between this population and the normal population; and if there were differences among them according to gender, the distance in which they competed, the results in the competition, and the motivations they stated for running. For each comparison, a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was performed to measure its differences and respective statistical significance. Results showed that the personality profile of the mountain runners matched that of successful athletes in terms of high Conscientiousness and low Neuroticism, however, Openness to Experience scores showed no significant differences with the normal population. Neither did significant differences appear in any of the traits between ultradistance and shorter distance runners, nor according to their motivations for running, nor between male and female runners (except in the Agreeableness dimension). Finally, a clustering of the runners was outlined according to their personality profiles and performance, to see if they fit existing classifications that distinguish between recreational and results-oriented athletes, observing that it was possible to establish distinct profiles among runners. These results are of relevance to sports practitioners, who can design tailored interventions according to athletes´ personality profiles and prevent negative consequences when these traits become associated with unhealthy behaviors. The modest gender differences found, allow questioning gender stereotypes within the sport and fostering a more equitable approach to athlete training. This knowledge can contribute to further growing the sport of trail and ultrarunning in Chile and Latin America."

Estudio de caso | KEYWORDS: Digital Platforms; Digital Technologies; Race Parameters; Trail Runners | ABSTRACT: The aim of this study is to describe a tracking methodology for a Trail Running (TR) athlete during five years through the capture of data from digital devices, associating the race pace and speed with the terrain slope. The trajectories generated by the global positioning system (GPS) were obtained from the Strava platform. From this information, measurements of horizontal distance, elevation gain, slope, horizontal speed, and vertical speed are made. In order to analyze the entire data spectrum the Tobler model was calibrated using a quantile regression. For each training week data from 8 previous weeks was used, and model parameters were extracted for each decile, P0: minimum rhythm; m1: critical angle, C + (relative cost of running uphill) and C-(relative cost of running downhill). We conclude that capturing daily data through digital devices is a useful way to obtain information on the association between race pace and slope. A quantile regression model could be useful for the design of training programs for a TR athlete."
951,6,"TITLE: Identifying an optimal analysis level in multiscalar regionalization: A study case of social distress in Greater Santiago | KEYWORDS: Autocorrelation; Data mining; MAUP; Multicolinearity; Spatial clustering; Stopping rule | ABSTRACT: Assembling spatial units into meaningful clusters is a challenging task, as it must cope with a consequential computational complexity while controlling for the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), spatial autocorrelation and attribute multicolinearity. Nevertheless, these effects can reveal significant interactions among diverse spatial phenomena, such as segregation and economic specialization. Various regionalization methods have been developed in order to address these questions, but key fundamental properties of the aggregation of spatial entities are still poorly understood. In particular, due to the lack of an objective stopping rule, the question of determining an optimal number of clusters is yet unresolved. Therefore, we develop a clustering algorithm which is sensitive to scalar variations of multivariate spatial correlations, recalculating PCA scores at several aggregation steps in order to account for differences in the span of autocorrelation effects for diverse variables. With these settings, the scalar evolution of correlation, compactness and isolation measures is compared between empirical and 120 random datasets, using two dissimilarity measures. Remarkably, adjusting several indicators with real and simulated data allows for a clear definition of a stopping rule for spatial hierarchical clustering. Indeed, increasing correlations with scale in random datasets are spurious MAUP effects, so they can be discounted from real data results in order to identify an optimal clustering level, as defined by the maximum of authentic spatial self-organization. This allows singling out the most socially distressed areas in Greater Santiago, thus providing relevant socio-spatial insights from their cartographic and statistical analysis. In sum, we develop a useful methodology to improve the fundamental comprehension of spatial interdependence and multiscalar self-organizing phenomena, while linking these questions to relevant real world issues."

Diverse studies have assessed the impact of conservation policies at global and regional levels by comparing deforestation rates between PAs and unprotected areas. Most of these studies are based on conventional methods and could overestimate the avoided deforestation of PAs by omitting from their analyses the lack of randomness in the allocation of forest protection.We demonstrate that estimates of effectiveness can be substantially improved by controlling for biases along dimensions that are observable and testing the sensitivity of estimates of potential hidden biases. We used matching methods to evaluate the impact on deforestation of Ecuador's tropical Andean forest protected-area system between 1990 and 2008. We found that protection reduced deforestation in approximately 6% of the protected forests. These would have been deforested had they not been protected. Conventional approaches to estimate conservation impact, which fail to control for observable covariates correlated with both protection and deforestation, substantially overestimate avoided deforestation. Our conclusions are robust to potential hidden bias, as well as to changes in modeling assumptions. In addition, it is assumed that this research will help decision-making in the framework of international climate change mitigation policies, such as REDD+."

In such space and organization, it is possible to notice the irregular occupation of their homes and the relationship that neighborhood committees had with local authorities between the 1920s and 1930s."

This is a work that explores the participation of the gay community in the social world configured in Chilean cyberpress texts between 2012-2017. The exploration is carried out from the theoretical-methodological articulation of the sociosemiotic APPRAISAL and IDEATION systems assigned to functional systemic linguistics to illustrate the relationship between social change and discursive change. The discursive analysis from these systems reveals that the gay community represented in the corpus constitutes an agent of social transformation, because it denounces homophobic violence and defends the victims, questions political and religious authorities, promotes changes and legal reforms and is recognized as political interlocutor before the events produced."

The biotic components and the interactions between them offer different resources and ecosystem services such as fiber, food, wood, pest and disease control, pollination, economic income and artistic inspiration, among many others. Chile is a biogeographic island whose biota has a high percentage of endemism due to their physical barriers that have modulated its biodiversity. However, since the decade of the 70s, the country underwent a serious transformation of the natural landscapes due to the neoliberal economic policies which have been perpetuated over time, especially in the center-south of Chile. Threats such as the development of the forest industry, agriculture and avocado plantations, mining and livestock have been important drivers in these transformations. Currently, the greatest biodiversity is mainly found in the hotspot of central Chile. However, this is an area with a high contrast. On the one hand, it is where most human impacts occur, and on the other hand, it is where the major concentration of endemic and threatened species, and potential ecosystem functions are concentrated. These have not been adequately managed and evaluated. Some reasons lie on the high degree of centralism present in the country, for example, most centers of study and monitoring of biodiversity are geographically centralized, limiting the geographical scope of their investigation. Other reasons lie on the high economic cost necessary to develop conservation plans; historical care for the environment has been relegated to the background. In addition, most national protected areas are unequally distributed, and are geographically isolated to areas with low population density. Given this scenario, our chapter is focused on showing biodiversity patterns and ecosystem functions, and where, the risk of human activities has a greater impact on the Chilean biota. In addition, based on these patterns and processes, some gaps have been identified to be addressed and considered in the design of conservation strategies in the future. A total of seven drivers were identified in the near future and they should be considered as threats to biodiversity in Chile. Thus, a holistic way to address them in order to protect our natural heritage is proposed. These drivers are: (1) the crisis of the taxonomy, it is financing, and its transdisciplinarity; (2) land use planning and site planning for production, urbanization and conservation; (3) slaughter areas and their environmental and social effects; (4) the re-nationalization of water as a fundamental right; (5) the establishment of education programs on biodiversity; (6) the re-connection with nature by society and (7) the management of plastic waste in the future."

However, key design challenges that remain unsolved including 1) how to effectively balance biodiversity conservation and sociocultural benefits, and 2) how user's perception and knowledge may affect the acceptance of conservation interventions in parks. In this study, we used a mixed methods approach in which focus groups were used to explore users' perceptions of landscape attributes, their benefits, biodiversity, climate change, and conservation interventions in parks. This was followed by face-to-face interviews with the broader general public to quantitatively assess perceptions and acceptability for conservation interventions in parks. While plant density and functional diversity were identified as key landscape attributes, trade-offs may occur with other attributes such as multi-functionality and the order of the vegetation. Most conservation interventions had high acceptance levels, where the decrease of grass in parks was the most controversial attribute. All interventions were correlated with the importance of landscape attributes and climate change concerns, but poorly associated with knowledge of native biodiversity. The results support 1) increasing the functional diversity of plants in parks as a way to balance environmental and sociocultural benefits and promote the acceptability of conservation interventions, however such an increase should be linked to designs that respect notions of order and other park uses, and 2) environmental education based on climate change may be the key to improving acceptability of these initiatives."

As has been increasingly observed by linguists, many minority languages are becoming endangered and will be lost forever if not documented. The increased urgency has led to the development of several global endangerment databases and a more fine-grained understanding of the language endangerment progression as well as its possible reversal. In the present paper, we explore the terminological correlates of this development as found in the descriptive linguistic literature, using a corpus of over 10,000 digitized grammatical descriptions. Comparing this with existing endangerment databases, we find that simply counting terms related to endangerment does signal endangerment, but the degree of endangerment is more difficult to assess from grammatical descriptions. The label endangered seems to be an umbrella term that covers different situations ranging from moribund languages with less than ten speakers to minority languages with several thousand speakers. For many languages considered endangered in existing databases, explicit terms to this effect cannot be found in their descriptions. The discrepancy is due to incompleteness of the searchterm set, gaps in the literature, and projected rather than observed information in the databases. Our explorations illustrate the potential for database curation assisted by computational searches both to maintain accuracy of the databases and to investigate assumed language endangerment. Future work includes a larger cloud of search terms, usage of term frequencies, and prescreening of descriptive literature for the existence of a relevant section. From the perspective of descriptive linguistics, this study calls for a more careful correlation between the language endangerment indexes, as developed in the global endangerment databases, and the treatment of the endangerment status of individual languages in descriptive grammars."

We first discuss the collaborative methodology implemented, which proved effective to create a treebank in the context of a Computational Linguistic course for undergraduates. Then, we describe the general details of the treebank and the language-specific considerations implemented for the proposed annotation. We finally conduct some experiments on part-of-speech tagging and syntactic dependency parsing. We focus on monolingual and transfer learning settings, where we study the impact of a Shipibo-Konibo treebank, another Panoan language resource."

The autonomous audio heater car is a comprehensive project-based analog design experience within a conceive, design, implement, operate framework. The students participate in the overall design process with guided discovery, rather than merely conducting scripted laboratory exercises. Students develop an understanding of the analog design required for each subsystem through weekly individual pre-laboratory and laboratory exercises. The car is guided to a beacon by light and/or audio tone. In transit, the car heats water to a temperature corresponding to the beacon tone and emits a tone corresponding to the instantaneous water temperature. The project culminates with team-based system integration and a competition. The individual work serves to cross-train all of the team members such that they all contribute effectively in the teams. The project motivated students because it provided a framework for laboratory topics, which would typically be considered without the broader context of a system design introduced at the beginning of the course."

Furthermore, it outlines the main explanatory models of historical linguistic change (grammaticalization, construc-tionalization, lexicalization, pragmatization, and discursive traditions) and shows how they can be applied to the study of lexical units and patrimonial structures of the Chilean variety. Lastly, it reflects about the possibility that the historical study of chilenismos results in a proposal for a Historical Dictionary of Chilean Spanish."

Specifically, we explore the semantic transformations that the verbal form has undergone, such as the emergence of the locative value, and some grammatical changes, such as the appearance of the pronominal version, the alternation in the prepositional regime, the auxiliarization in inchoative periphrasis, and the turn towards the transitive-locative use. From a theoretical point of view, we interact with grammaticalization theory, with construction grammar and with a cognitivist conception of semantic change. In addition, we dialogue with the Chilean and Pan-Hispanic lexicography regarding the description of the verb ganarse. In relation to methodology, we use historical linguistic corpus, current databases and digitized historical documents, in order to support the analysis with qualitative and quantitative foundations. As a result of our research, we explain the semantic and grammatical changes of the verb in the Chilean variety, and we argue a proposal for diachronic drift."

The study focuses on the daily experiences and needs of the believers and users who frequent this space. In contrast to those interpretations that emphasize the calculated search for spiritual benefit as the main driver of decision-making in open religious economies, this study analyzes the day-to-day dynamics and motivations that lead individuals to engage in transactions of goods and services in accor-dance with their practical needs. It also sheds light on their fears, disappointments and hopes, as well as their ability to reconnect with the sacred. To this end, a qualitative design was used, based on ethnographies, in-depth interviews and observations in stores selling religious, spiritual, magical, and esoteric items, as well as on the streets and passages in the city’s historic center where a variety of services (divination, healing, protection) are offered. The results support the existence of flexible individuals who construct their belief systems in relation to the challenges and needs they face in their daily lives, beyond the theological and dogmatic restrictions defined by institutions. They also account for the constitution of associative networks built by suppliers and consumers, which amplifies the impact of new or novel religious/spiritual experiences through multiple interactions with hybrid belief systems."

Fibroblasts have low secretory activity. However, in response to injury, they differentiate to myofibroblasts. These cells have an increased extracellular matrix synthesis and secretion, including collagen fibers, providing stiffness to the tissue. In pathological conditions myofibroblasts became resistant to apoptosis, remaining in the tissue, causing excessive extracellular matrix secretion and deposition, which contributes to the progressive tissue remodeling. Therefore, increased myofibroblast content within damaged tissue is a characteristic hallmark of heart, lung, kidney and liver fibrosis. Recently, it was described that cardiac fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation is triggered by the transforming growth factor ß1 (TGF-ß1) through a Smad-independent activation of Forkhead box O (FoxO). FoxO proteins are a transcription factor family that includes FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6. In several cells types, they play an important role in cell cycle arrest, oxidative stress resistance, cell survival, energy metabolism, and cell death. Here, we review the role of FoxO family members on the regulation of cardiac fibroblast proliferation and differentiation."
971,-1,"TITLE: When nonactivists care: Group efficacy mediates the effect of social identification and perceived instability on the legitimacy of collective action | KEYWORDS: collective action; group efficacy; legitimacy; perceived instability; social identity | ABSTRACT: In recent years, multiple social movements have emerged around the world. In addition, public surveys indicate the highest recorded levels of support for protest. In this context of acceptance of collective action, we examine the role of nonactivists in the perceived legitimacy of social movements, as this “passive” support can contribute to social change. Given that antecedents of legitimacy have been neglected in the literature, we carried out a survey (N = 605) among a general sample of the population in Chile to shed light on this issue. We found that social identification with movements and perceived instability predicted the perceived legitimacy of protests by social movements, and that both variables had only indirect effects through group efficacy. This suggests that perceiving social movements as able to achieve success can lead nonactivists to perceive their actions as legitimate, highlighting the importance to movements of being seen to be effective."

Methodology: A quasi-experimental crossover study was carried out with 13 individuals (7 men, mean age 23.7 years). The participants performed two exercise sessions: one with musical synchronization and the other not synchronized, but listening to the music of personal preference, with an interval of 72 hours between sessions. Heart rate (HR), perceived exertion (PE), internal training load (ITL) and heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated during the sessions. Results: During the synchronized session, significantly lower mean HR and peak HR (Δ-5.5% and Δ-5.2%, respectively) and lower peak PE (Δ-9.9%) were observed compared to the non-synchronized session. The ICD was also lower (Δ-10%) in the synchronized exercise. No significant differences were found in HRV between sessions. Variations in HR and EP were determined by temporal changes during the sessions. Only changes in HR were determined by the musical synchronization of the exercises. Conclusions: In the sample studied, musically synchronized exercise resulted in lower perceived cardiovascular intensity, without variations on autonomic regulation."

Consequently, indirect methods, such as the Talk Test (TT), have been validated in adults, yet not in children. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between TT and objective methods to quantify the intensity of exercise in healthy Chilean children. Methods: Healthy children of both genders aged between 8 and 12 years old were considered for the study. The participants performed two incremental step exercise tests separated by 7 days. The TT was incorporated in one of the two tests randomly. The HR, effort perception (EP) and workload were measured every one minute during the test. HR, EP and workload were compared by positive (TT + / +), equivocal (TT +/-), and negative (TT - / -) response of the TT. Additionally, the reliability of cardiorespiratory parameters during TT was determined. A value of p <0.05 was considered significant. Results: 48 participants aged 9.7 ± 1.1 years old were selected. There was a significant difference in cardiorespiratory parameters between the TT responses (p <.001). The percent of maximum HR in TT + / + was 72.2 ± 8.2%, in TT +/- was 87.9 ± 8.1% and in TT - / - was 92.0 ± 7.5%. The reliability of cardiorespiratory parameters during TT was fair to excellent in both genders. Conclusions: TT was associated to cardiorespiratory parameters to regulate exercise intensity in healthy children."

This study analyses the taxonomy, technology and distribution of these goods in the sites Tulan 54, 85 and 122 from the Tilocalar phase in order to access their function and meanings in ritual contexts, as well as their uses as exchange goods. Our analysis points to both spatial and contextual differentiation between Argopecten purpuratus, a Pacific Ocean bivalve, and Strophocheilus oblongus, a gastropod from the Argentinian neotropics. This difference is interpreted in light of other archaeological and ethnographical contexts with high symbolic meaning. Thus, we attempt to contribute to the understanding of this period of emerging social differences and transformation of subsistence modes in the Salar de Atacama."

Nevertheless, the archaeological record of seaweed burning is still limited to contexts where preservation is exceptional and macroscopic discrimination of charred remains is possible. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy in discriminating seaweed vs. plant/wood char. Our dataset (N = 92) consists of modern and archaeological seaweed and plant/wood charred remains, including specimens of unknown origin from the Atacama Desert coast, Northern Chile. The charred samples were processed to obtain 13 parameters which were then fed into five supervised machine learning models. The models, built on samples of known origin (seaweed and plant/wood), performed remarkably well in terms of accuracy, kappa, sensitivity, and specificity. The models were used for final predictions on 10 non-identified archaeological charcoals. Our results suggest that Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning techniques is a robust methodology for discriminating seaweed and plant/wood charred remains in the archaeological record. The predictions on unknown samples confirm that seaweed was used as fuel in a specific funerary ritual in the southern Atacama Desert coast around 5000 cal BP. Furthermore, charred specimens of Lessonia spp. recovered from combustion features in other northern Chile coastal settlements, suggest that seaweed pyrotechnology developed by Atacama Desert coast people is likely a long-term process. As for coastal archaeology, this work encourages new research on seaweed as an alternative/main fuel in coastal deserts and evaluates possible bias for chronologies from coastal archaeological settlements around the globe."

To this end, a review was made of the historical evolution of brass bands in the Norte Grande de Chile and field work was done with that band. In addition, archaeological, ethnohistorical and ethnographic data dealing with the association between music and ritual in religious ceremonies of the Central-South Andes from pre-Hispanic times to the present were considered. It is argued that through their musical practices, the Andean brass bands participate in the continuity and change of a framework of musical, devotional and spatio-temporal relationships, of identities and collective memories, which persist from pre-Inca times and have tenaciously incorporated recent sounds and devotions. These practices interweave versatility, tradition and modernity in correspondence relationships, as we will review for the case of Alcones del Folklore, during the festivity of Espíritu Santo, in the town of Jaiña (Tarapacá, Norte Grande de Chile), the years 2014 and 2015."

983,3,"TITLE: Reducing urban speed limits decreases work-related traffic injury severity: Evidence from Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: Speed limit regulation; Traffic incident severity; Traffic safety; Urban and rural mobility; Work-related incidents | ABSTRACT: Work-related transportation incidents significantly impact urban mobility and productivity. These incidents include traffic crashes, collisions between vehicles, and falls that occurred during commuting or work-related transportation (e.g., falling while getting off a bus during the morning commute or while riding a bicycle for work). This study analyzes a decade of work-related transportation incident data (2012–2021) in Santiago, Chile, using records from a major worker's insurance company. Using negative binomial regression, we assess the impact of a 2018 urban speed limit reduction law on incident injury severity. We also explore broader temporal, spatial, and demographic patterns in these incidents in urban and rural areas. The urban speed limit reduction is associated with a decrease of 4.26 days in prescribed medical leave for incidents in urban areas, suggesting that lower speed limits contribute to reduced injury severity. Our broader analysis reveals distinct incident patterns across different groups. Workers traveling by motorcycle and bicycle experience more severe injuries when involved in traffic incidents, with marginal effects of 26.94 and 13.06 additional days of medical leave, respectively, compared to motorized vehicles. Female workers tend to have less severe injuries, with an average of 7.57 fewer days of medical leave. Age is also a significant factor, with older workers experiencing more severe injuries — each additional year of age is associated with 0.57 more days of medical leave. Our results provide insights for urban planning, transportation policy, and workplace safety initiatives."
984,1,"TITLE: Waters of resistance: decolonising perspectives on women’s territorial r-existence in southern Chile | KEYWORDS: Decolonial feminism; ecología política; feminismo decolonial; gobernanza del agua; political ecology; water governance | ABSTRACT: This article explores the gendered experiences of, and responses to, processes of water commodification and scarcity in rural areas of the Toltén River in southern Chile through a decolonial lens. Within the framework of neoliberal water governance, water use rights are primarily owned by large-scale agribusiness and industrial companies, leading to significant socioecological conflicts (dispossession, pollution, and resource depletion) and gendered disparities in rural areas. Women face severe vulnerability concerning access to land and water rights, often resulting in their exclusion from decision-making processes. Consequently, they encounter barriers to accessing credit, subsidies, and capital, further exacerbating their marginalisation and impoverishment. Drawing upon stories collected from women leaders of rural drinking water committees and co-operatives, social movements, and peasant women in the Toltén hydrosocial territory in southern Chile, we analyse conflicts over water use and valuation, along with the different forms of r-existence in which women engage to counter the commodification of water through community-based water management initiatives. Their efforts challenge portrayals of rural women as passive victims of development and reject the notions of water as a mere resource for exploitation. We argue for the adoption of a decolonial feminist approach to investigate everyday forms of r-existence that contribute to collaborative water governance processes. By centring the diverse needs, concerns, and priorities of rural women, this framework offers pathways for transformative change at the intersection of gender, water governance, and colonial legacies."

Following a micropolitical approach, our objective is to understand, on the one hand, the tensions, and conflicts arising within local communities as a result of this resistance and, on the other hand, the political role of hope in the struggle for the defense of life, as championed by indigenous and environmental movements. Building upon this, our aim is to contribute to the literature on hope movements from the perspective of micropolitical ecology, as well as to the ongoing debate on the role of emotions and affect in social mobilization. Through collaborative and engaged research, we examine two case studies, the Añihuarraqui (Curarrehue) and Tránquil (Panguipulli) small hydropower plants, which will allow us to delve into the social practices that produce and maintain hope amidst apocalypse and despair. Beyond opposition to specific projects, this article shows that the fight for the defense of life advocated by hope movements within Mapuche territory presents us with alternatives to reconfigure the relationship between society and nature in a context of global socio-ecological crisis."

Inspired by an ontological sensibility and the idea of worlding, we sustain that hydroelectric energy is embedded in, and is the source of, multiple worlds where different ontologies of water and energy meet, not always peacefully. Drawing on in-depth interviews and documentary sources, we identify three worlds or realities–yet not entirely autonomous–in which the HidroAysén project exists: the National Hydropower World, the Market Hydropower World, and the Sustainable Hydropower World. We argue that these three realities, through different ecologies, knowledge, and narratives, execute different parameters of reality and objectivity. Our final argument is that an ontological approach to analyze hydropower development and the conflicts that it has spurred can stimulate new ways of thinking about taken-for-granted assumptions, categories, and practices regarding the way hydropower is or might be produced."

It identifies the key role of Climate Change as an international policy object, since mitigation strategies have given way to the development of ncre projects. The case of Rukatayo Alto, constructed ethnographically and from a local history perspective, illustrates the impacts that these policies bring about on a territory of Southern Chile that is inhabited by rural and indigenous population. The paper suggests that, considering the fact of the social resistance originated by energy projects, it is urgent to broaden the incidence of territorial agents on decision making processes that affect them; and that the concept of “territorialization” of policies should be preferred than that of “localization”."

The results show that the last ten years have seen increasing numbers in the scientific production and that the more outstanding authors of the region are mainly from Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Colombia, with the United States being the non-Latin American country involved in the largest number of collaborations. Brazil is the most productive country in the region and the areas that draw most interest are Optics, Materials Science, Physics Applied, Nanotechnology and Chemistry Physical. Given that collaborations with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) involve more than 1000 authors per document or other large similar collaborations, works associated with high energy physics have been excluded from this study."

An authentic, situated writing task was devised, offering students a communicative purpose and a defined audience. Two devices were utilized for the cognitive activation of topic and genre knowledge: an infographic and a genre model. The participants in this study were 162 fifth-grade students from Santiago de Chile, with 78 students assigned to the experimental condition (with activation device) and 84 students assigned to the control condition (without activation device). The results demonstrate that the odds of presenting good writing ability are higher for students who were part of the experimental group, even when controlling for text transcription ability, considered a predictor of writing. These findings hold implications for the development of large-scale tests of writing guided by principles of educational and social justice."

A case study was conducted with two trainee teachers, who submitted two texts (one academic and one non-academic) and participated in a semi-structured interview. The findings indicate how teachers develop the writing process and their skills of metalinguistic awareness and rhetorical flexibility in two writing experiences, and how they construct flexible identities as writers. We propose a model for writing education that builds on the opportunities and challenges identified in the research."

This research addressed teachers’ beliefs, given its relevance in informing educational decision-making. Specifically, a comparative study was undertaken to explore Chilean in service and pre-service teachers’s beliefs about writing, following the epistemic tradition. To achieve this, a Spanish instrument, centered on reproductive and epistemic beliefs, was adapted and validated through the administration of an online questionnaire to a sample of 232 participants. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was employed, confirming the structure of two independent scales. Descriptive and mean comparison analyses between practicing and pre-service teachers, as well as between primary and secondary education teachers, revealed higher scores on the epistemic scale than on the reproductive scale for all groups. However, for the planning and textualization dimension, results leaned towards reproductive beliefs. Concerning reproductive beliefs, practicing teachers scored higher than pre-service teachers. Regarding epistemic beliefs, primary education teachers and practicing teachers scored higher than secondary education teachers and pre-service teachers. These results partially align with previous national studies on teachers’ beliefs about writing. The findings suggest some implications for teacher education in writing."

Three evidence-based assumptions supported this actions (a) that students who have a positive attitude and strong self-efficacy beliefs about themselves as writers devote more attention and effort to writing, thus positively affecting performance, (b) that teachers and writing education experiences influence students’ motivation to write, and (c) that teachers with positive attitudes and beliefs about themselves as writers feel more confident and devote more time to writing instruction. Throughout the country, students from 1st to 12th grades received free writing journals with prompts representing diverse writing purposes. Teachers received general guidelines for implementing writing communities. Additionally, 40 teachers participated from a pilot study experience of free writing workshops with renowned writers. Results from a study in four schools show that students across grades significantly improved their motivation to write; that motivation was related to the possibility of writing about personal topics, expressing feelings, and reflecting about life; that writing communities were welcoming, free, and diverse; and that teachers adapted the general guidelines to their contexts. Teachers who participated in the workshops reported that the experience fostered their own motivation to write and modeled free writing methodologies they could transfer to their classrooms."

Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a qualitative methods approach, utilizing an instrumental case study. As the primary data source, researchers conducted 14 individual, semistructured interviews. Participants included two comentors, six mentor teachers and six mentee teachers from two K-8 focal school sites. Data were examined using the content analysis method. Findings: Results revealed five aspects that contributed to PM's execution: the voluntary participation model, the reflective emphasis, the focus on teaching and learning, the facilitating role of the principal and comentor support. At the same time, the findings indicated three factors that hindered PM's success: interruptions due to schedule conflicts, limited dissemination throughout the school community and assimilation of the values embedded in the Chilean teacher evaluation system. Practical implications: PM holds great potential for collaborative professional development and continuous improvement of teachers' instructional practices, drawing on their experiences and resources and leading to the strengthening sense of professionalism in teaching and in teachers' social esteem. Originality/value: This is the first research to address a formal PM project in Chile aimed specifically at in-service teachers. Previous projects in the country have focused on novice teachers. Unlike other initiatives in the region, this project does not focus on teacher induction but on capacity building within schools through collaborative work. This research also adopts an approach based on support for teachers' professional development, while in Chile the main policies currently focus on teacher evaluation."

Semi-structured interviews were used to recall memories, spontaneous stories, and interpretations of the experience with 15 students from two different schools. Intersubjective and inductive analyses of all the interviews were conducted by the researchers and the results were constructed around three themes of the experience: the individual, the social, and the situated levels. Students are highly appreciative of personal life having a place in school as the expression and experience of emotions, venting of sadness and problems, writing about topics of interest, reflection on one’s own life, and exercise of identity. Also highlighted is the view that writing in the classroom does not have to be an exercise that is fake, structured, mundane, and punitive, which is often the case, and that there should be opportunities for free writing within a benevolent environment in which peers and teachers collaborate with authenticity around topics that are valuable for the community."

Even though Chile has subscribed the 4th Sustainable Development Goal to ensure an equitable, inclusive and quality education, the current educational structure as well as the lack of an inter-cultural educational policy, are obstacles to ensure the right to education for all. This article aims to provide evidence on the conditions under which immigrant students learn in Chile, by analyzing their performance in writing-a potential mediator (or obstacle) for schooling-, their learning barriers (beliefs, attitudes and teacher expectations), and socio-emotional wellbeing. Our results demonstrate that immigrant students are divided in two achievement groups, which face different barriers according to their country of origin. On the one hand, students from Haiti, Bolivia and Dominican Republic are more vulnerable. On the other hand, students from Peru, Venezuela and Colombia outperform their peers in writing, have higher levels of self-esteem and self-efficiency, and teachers have greater educational expectations for them. This evidence suggests the need to inquire the intersections between language and race related to discrimination and prejudice."

That is why this article seeks to rethink and resignify the international evidence on mentoring in order to contribute to the production of contextualized knowledge. A multiple case study was conducted, guided by the following research objective: Conceptualize a 'good mentoring' and a 'good mentor' considering the voices of the actors involved in Chilean induction programs for novice principals executed in 2017. 21 interviews were conducted with principals, mentors and program coordinators; and then a thematic analysis by case and across the cases was carried out. The results allow defining common characteristics of a 'good mentoring' and a 'good mentor' among the interviewees and deriving guidelines to adequately contextualize mentoring in the induction programs for novice school principals."

The framework for this study involves the concepts of metacognition and metalinguistic awareness, and five models of the writing process: Flower & Hayes (1981), the ""knowledge telling"" and ""knowledge transformation"" theory proposed by Bereiter & Scardamalia (1987, 1992), Hayes (2000), and the DIDACTEXT model (2003). The aim of this study is, firstly, to identify, describe and explain the theories of writing that are at the core of this curriculum, in order to inform school teachers and university teachers of pedagogy. The second purpose of this study is to determine what is emphasized in the curriculum, as well as, what areas are ambiguous and what is left out of it, in the light of what we know today about the teaching of writing."
998,0,"TITLE: The recognition of differences as a basis for inclusive education: Assessment as barrier at teacher speech El reconocimiento de las diferencias como fundamento para la educación inclusiva: La evaluación como barrera en el discurso docente | KEYWORDS: Diversity; Inclusive education; Recognition | ABSTRACT: In Chile, a significant number of students from minority groups are excluded from participating in the educational system due to their cultural, linguistic, biological or social differences. The theory of recognition proposes a system of categories that allows analyzing the educational responses formulated to overcome barriers of access, participation and progress in the school trajectory. To do this, it is proposed to critically analyze the discourse of teachers, as the main actors involved in the daily implementation of educational policies on inclusion, in educational spaces in which practices and experiences rooted in a traditional school culture are reproduced. Evidencing these discourses will allow us to approach the understanding of the problem of participation and academic progress in the educational system of students from minority groups."

Structuring a differenced and open education system faced the stresses of uncertainty. In this context, based on a qualitative methodology, this study discusses the social representations of inclusive policy from 378 online comments posted by Internet users of Chilean news portals. Content analysis was performed to identify the assessments and arguments supporting the representations of educational inclusion. The inability to counterargument in past virtual environments is identified as the main limitation for in-depth information. Two models of representations are identified; the first linked to a social reproduction orientation associated to learning disciplinary standards and assessment of institutional educational projects, while the second assessed the right to education prioritizing learning and respect for individuals."

The test foundations come from the analysis of natural semantic networks and a bibliographical revision and an expert panel was in charge of validating the test's content. 1000 third grade students were evaluated independently. The final version of the instrument contained 21 items which, through exploratory factor analysis, were grouped in six factors: information extraction, phonological skills, during reading strategies, after reading strategies, non-literary texts interpretation, and sequencing. Internal reliability of the test was appropriate (alpha=.778), and significant correlation between the score of the instrument, the score obtained in the language subject, the academic self-esteem test, and the educational special needs of the students was found."
1001,3,"TITLE: Pedestrian level of service: The impact of social groups on pedestrian flow characteristics | KEYWORDS: Pedestrian groups; Pedestrian level of service | ABSTRACT: A comprehensive measure of the level of pedestrian comfort can lead to an improved design of public spaces, to the appropriate dimensioning of urban infrastructure (such as airports, stations and commercial centers), and, most importantly, to a design that is more responsive to people and to that very fundamental human activity: walking. The planning and design of the pedestrian environment is based on pedestrian Levels of Service (LOS). These levels currently classify the level of comfort based on space available for movement and speed (and delay, in case of crosswalks). Guidance is provided for different area types and times of day. Although many methods of assessing pedestrian LOS have been developed, all these do not consider spontaneous pedestrian groups. However, social groups, such as friends, couples, colleagues and families, represent an important component of urban crowds. The paper presents first, an overview of the current methods for assessing pedestrian environment LOS. Then the paper presents the application of the HCM method for the evaluation of a selected site LOS. The calculation is based on collected measurements of pedestrian flow. Some critical issues and inconsistencies result. These have been reviewed and read taking into account the presence of groups in pedestrian flows."
1002,20,"TITLE: Is there a relationship between physical fitness and the way of commuting to and from school? Findings from a southern Chilean school health and performance survey 2018 ¿Existe una relación entre la aptitud física y la forma de desplazarse hacia y desde la escuela? Hallazgos de una encuesta de rendimiento y salud escolar del sur de Chile 2018 | KEYWORDS: Active Commuting; Chile; IFIS; Physical Fitness; Schoolchildren | ABSTRACT: Although current research indicates that the active mode of displacement commuting influences the health of schoolchildren, what is known about the relationship between self-reported physical fitness and its relationship with active commuting to school (ACS) is known less so. In addition, trends highlight the need to conduct country-specific analyses to understand each context better. The aims of this study were a) to analyze self-reported physical fitness and the ACS, and b) to determine the association between self-reported physical fitness and the ACS through an extensive survey in southern Chile. A cross-sectional analytic design was conducted. The sample consisted of 733 schoolchildren (aged 10 to 16, 46.1% girls) from Chilean public schools. The International Fitness Scale (IFIS) was used to determine the self-reported physical fitness. The ACS was assessed using separate questions about commuting to and from school. The main results showed that the boys presented better self-reported physical fitness than the girls, except in the self-perception of flexibility (p= 0.041). In addition, an association was observed between the ACS and the self-reported flexibility (OR:1.53, p=0.022; OR:1.47, p= 0.036), an association that was maintained when adjusting for sex and age (OR:1.55, p=0.020; OR:1.50, p= 0.030), and self-reported speed and agility was associated only with active commuting from school (OR:1.60, p=0.005), also after adjusted model (OR:1.81, p=0.024). In conclusion, this study provides evidence regarding the relationship between self-reported physical fitness and active ways of ACS. Strategies that favor ACS should be sought to promote health in schoolchildren."

Objectives: To assess the performance of the BMI cut-off point ≥30 kg/m2 in classifying obesity in older adults, using the fat mass index (FMI) and fat mass percentage (FM%) as reference criteria; and to establish region- and sex-specific BMI-based cut-off points to classify obesity in older adults. Methods: The present study is a secondary analysis derived from a cross-sectional project that included a sample of 1463 older adults from ten Latin American and Caribbean countries. Volunteers underwent total body water measurements using the deuterium dilution technique to determine FMI and FM%. Accuracy of the BMI and derived cutoff points was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The BMI cut-off point ≥30 kg/m2 had low sensitivity for classifying obesity in these older adults compared to the FMI and FM%. The AUC values for the optimal BMI-derived cut-off points showed an acceptable-to-outstanding discriminatory capacity in diagnosing obesity defined by the FMI. There was also a better balance between sensitivity and specificity than with the values obtained by a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 in older subjects in both regions. Conclusion: The BMI cut-off point ≥30 kg/m2 had poor sensitivity for accurately diagnosing obesity in older adults from two regions. The region- and sex-specific BMI-derived cut-off points for defining obesity using the FMI are more accurate in classifying obesity in older men and women subjects from both regions."

Multiple correspondence analysis was employed to analyze the terms produced through free-word association technique, by 741 people. The two first dimensions explained 62.4 % of the inertia and showed that the contribution of city of residence was several times higher than the average; the contribution of gender and educational level was higher than average as well. The northern city representations were characterized by positive terms, whereas more negative contents were characteristic of the city of the center, and terms without an explicitly positive or negative assessment were associated to the southern city. These findings reinforce the relevance of the local sociocultural context in shaping social representations of old age and stress the importance of considering particular regional features in the design of policies and interventions aimed to recognize and integrate older adults in Chile."

There are growing concerns for the health and well-being of an ever-growing population. Aging is accompanied by a series of changes, cognitive decline being one of them. As health becomes more challenging, physical activity may become more cumbersome. However, in many instances, physical activity has been found to prevent and delay cognitive decline. In fact, exercise may prove to be a powerful preventative measure against cognitive impairment in older adults. The aim of this chapter is to explore the evidence base of the effects of physical activity on cognitive decline prevention as well as to review the recommended guidelines for physical activity in this population based on findings in the field."
1006,0,"TITLE: Spatial Perspectives: A Missing Link for Comparative Teacher Education Research | KEYWORDS: Context; Socio-spatial; Spatial theory; Territoriality | ABSTRACT: Spatial theory can move comparative teacher education research into a new realm of analysis. A spatial triad of relative, representational, and lived space is applied to four illustrative cases of teacher education policy and practice to argue that such an approach offers a more nuanced, rich, and contextual understanding, which moves beyond descriptive accounts of the influence of context. The concept of relative space is used to show how global trends influence Teacher Standards and accountability systems in China and England. The use of representational space shows how spaces of professional practice are defined in policymaking in Chile. An exploration of policies, influencing university-based teacher education in Brazil, shows how an individual’s ability to access teacher education is affected by their lived space: where they live, their intersectional characteristics, and the risk of urban violence. The use of this spatial triad of theories, individually or collectively, can enrich comparative teacher education research, as they enable researchers to move beyond description into a nuanced understanding of teacher education as a thoroughly spatial practice."
1007,0,TITLE: Expanding the notion of teacher professionalism from geography education Expandiendo la noción de profesionalidad docente desde la educación geográfica | KEYWORDS: Curriculum making; Didactics; Expertise; Geography education; Teacher practice | ABSTRACT: The objective of this conceptual paper was to explore how teachers’ practice was problematised in the field of geography education. Research in geography didactics and curriculum making are two fields that have been relevant to build the understanding on teachers practice in geography. The challenge for geography education therefore appears to be how to understand the relationships between the two in coherent and systematic ways. This paper engages with the specific meaning of being a subject specialist and the gap in the literature between curriculum making and didactics to understand that specialisation. A second gap is identified regarding the relationship between teacher practice and the professional practices encircling in-classroom activities. The paper finalises suggesting the use of the term expertise to address the dynamics of specialisation in a subject but also with its implication to teachers’ professional practice.

An interpretive case study was conducted with data collected through classroom observations, interviews, and questionnaires, and these data were then analyzed through triangulation. The findings showed that these teachers, who are the most qualified within the region's context, consider geography to be marginal knowledge in the school curriculum, although they also consider it relevant to the education of their pupils. Both elements provided evidence of the fragility of their geographical knowledge, which fell within a spectrum that combines expert knowledge and lay knowledge."
1009,0,"TITLE: Getting Back to Basics: Is the Knowledge of School Geography Powerful in Chile? | KEYWORDS: Academic Discipline; Disciplinary Knowledge; Geographical Space; School Subject; Subject Knowledge | ABSTRACT: The study on which this chapter is based provides evidence that pedagogical knowledge and everyday knowledge are the mediating elements which can influence the way geography is understood and taught in Chile. This can be interpreted, in the words of Stengel (1997), as a discontinuous relationship between the two spheres, i.e. the academic discipline and the school subject, in which the school subject is structured as polysemic disciplinary knowledge and is perceived by teachers as fragmented. Geography teachers’ subject knowledge would appear to contradict what Young (2008) defines as “powerful knowledge” and sheds new light on the relationship between the academic discipline component and its function for school geography. This is assessed in relation to Chilean teachers’ conceptualisations of Geography, how Geography is understood in Chile, and how these conceptualisations are reflected in what is eventually taught."

Chilean Teachers’ Views on Teaching Geography | KEYWORDS: Anthropogenic Element; Class Observation; Geographical Knowledge; Geographical Space; Spatial Experience | ABSTRACT: This chapter aims to contribute to the body of knowledge in geography teaching on the nature of and challenges to developing geographical thinking in Chilean schools. The discussion that follows first identifies the kinds of geography subject knowledge taught in Chile and second identifies the pivotal role of the way in which teachers perceive and develop their own geographical thinking and how this translates into their classroom practice. We performed lesson observations and interviews with forty-nine geography teachers in Chile across two networks: Teachers of Teachers and Rural Micro Centres. Findings, show that there is a strong tension between teacher training, and teachers’ own learning as in-service teachers. The paper concludes that developing geographical thinking in Chilean schools is influenced by a complex range of inter-related factors including the quality of teacher geography knowledge, their different interpretations of geography knowledge and their application of these in classroom practices."

The research questions that guided this study focused on the importance of understanding how teachers negotiate their assumptions and what sources of knowledge support their claims. As such, teachers' knowledge was investigated as a step towards the professionalisation of their practices. In terms of methodology, 21 teachers were interviewed in the context of a larger research project currently being conducted on Chilean teachers' thought processes. Semi-structured interviews were designed to elicit data on teachers' practices and conceptualisations. Data analysis involved codification of these same practices and conceptualisations, and defining categories that encapsulated teachers' expertise. The key findings from analysing teacher narratives included the observation that their practices and notions of subject expertise were identified as experience-based. Teachers' uncertified expertise in areas where they had had no formal training could be understood as mechanisms they have developed during their professional career. These elements could be seen as an implicit self-generated supporting system for teachers' practices."
1012,2,"TITLE: Implementation and Outcomes of a National School-Based Mental Health Program for Middle School Students in Chile | KEYWORDS: Adolescence; Classroom adaptation; Prevention; Psychosocial functioning; School-based mental health | ABSTRACT: Background: Chile’s national school-based mental health program, Skills for Life (SFL), has demonstrated effectiveness in improving behavioral and academic outcomes in first- through third-grade students. The current study assessed the feasibility and outcomes of SFL’s program for sixth- through eighth-grade students. Methods: We assessed the percentage of students who participated in the program and longitudinal changes on teacher-reported Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation Re-Revised (TOCA-RR) scores, youth-reported Pediatric Symptom Checklist-Chile (PSC-Y-CL) scores, grade-point average, and school attendance from sixth to eighth grade (2016–2018) for SFL’s workshop intervention. Linear mixed effects models analyzed the association between outcome variables and workshop attendance. Results: Of the 30,649 sixth graders who attended the 754 participating schools in 2016, 28,204 (92.0%) were screened with the TOCA-RR. Of the 1829 students who screened at risk, 1344 had available workshop data for seventh grade, with 86.9% of them participating in most (≥ 7) workshop sessions. Workshop attendance was significantly associated with improvements in school attendance and peer relationships (a TOCA-RR subscale) in eighth grade. Conclusions: With high rates of behavioral health screening and workshop attendance, this study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing SFL’s middle school program on a national scale. Higher workshop attendance by at-risk students was associated with better school attendance and peer relationships in eighth grade, as well as better but not significantly different outcomes on other measures (e.g., teacher-rated school performance and aggressive behavior in the classroom). Overall, these findings provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and benefits of SFL’s middle school program."
1013,2,"TITLE: Exploring the Influence School Climate on the Relationship between School Violence and Adolescent Subjective Well-Being | KEYWORDS: Adolescent wellbeing; School climate; School violence | ABSTRACT: School climate plays a key, protecting role against adverse outcomes when young individuals face peer victimization. Here we examined the potential relationships among adolescent’s wellbeing, school violence, and school climate in a sample of 2006 Chilean students (48% female) aged 10–21 (M = 14.97, SD = 1.86) from 20 schools located in the same school department. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire assessing wellbeing, school violence, and school climate. Using multilevel (Hierarchical Linear Modeling; HLM) methods we found that positive interpersonal relationships (an indicator of school climate) were significantly associated to wellbeing at schools (γ01 =.24, p <.01). School bonding was also associated to peer victimization and wellbeing (γ90 =.14, p <.10). Our results highlight the importance of improving school related factors in order to achieve a more supportive environment for youth wellbeing."
1014,2,"TITLE: Sense of Community and Life Satisfaction in Chilean Adolescents | KEYWORDS: Adolescents; Chile; Life satisfaction; Sense of community | ABSTRACT: This study aims to contribute to the understanding of life satisfaction in Chilean adolescents, integrating dimensions regarding the relationship between the individual and their community environment. Specifically, this study examines the contribution that variables such as sense of community have on life satisfaction, examining the association between sense of community and overall life satisfaction. During the 2014/2015 school year, 438 adolescents between 1st and 4th year of their high school from 7 municipalities in 3 regions of Chile participated in the study. The instruments used were the Sense of Community Scale, and the Personal Well-being Index – School Children (PWI-SC). The analysis included descriptive and multivariate analyses. The main results indicate that the sense of community is significantly associated with life satisfaction, even when controlling for demographic variables. In addition, the two sense of community subscales were also associated with life satisfaction. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that the perception of community variables influences the assessment that adolescents have on their lives. The discussion includes the implications for future research and community psychology in developing countries."
1015,2,"TITLE: Bullying, Cyberbullying, Student Life Satisfaction and the Community of Chilean Adolescents | KEYWORDS: Adolescence; Bullying; Community; Cyberbullying; Life satisfaction; Quality of life | ABSTRACT: Feeling support from the community is a vital aspect of adolescents’ quality of life. Negative experiences at school, such as bullying and cyberbullying can have an adverse impact on adolescents’ life satisfaction that can expand to different domains of their lives including community variables. The goal of the present study was to examine the association between peer victimization, life satisfaction and community support among Chilean adolescents. We used a sample of 497 youths enrolled in grades 9 to 12 of public and private schools in different Chilean districts. Results indicate a negative association between bullying and cyberbullying behavior on community support through life satisfaction. Peer victimization can have negative consequences for youths at a personal level on their assessments of life satisfaction, which can expand to feeling less support from the community. Feeling less support from the community can be detrimental to healthy youth development and adolescents’ quality of life. Community prevention efforts can thus provide emotional support for youth victims of bullying and cyberbullying."

Building childhood indicators is necessary in order to develop local prevention efforts to support this population at the local level. This growing effort requires more accurate socio demographic information from the Chilean childhood population and their relationship with subjective well-being to inform prevention initiatives. A total of 1520 pupils participated in this study (45.2% female; mean age: 11.51). The aim of this research is to examine the association of demographic variables such as age, sex, type of school, and SES on four measures of well-being. Results indicate different types and levels of association between sociodemographic variables and well-being. Implications are provided considering the Chilean context."

Chile is no exception to this situation that represents a gap in the literature for South American countries research. Thus, the aim was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Personal Well-being Index for School Children (PWI-SC) of Cummins et al. Social Indicators Research, 64(2), 159–190, (2003) in a sample of Chilean school children. We use a sample of 1096 pupils between 10 and 12 years old (M = 11.03; SD = 0.89) and residents of three major Chilean cities. Results of Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis provided evidence for only one single factor solution. Moreover, an acceptable level of internal reliability was observed (α = 0.77). The discussion of results considers other internationals applications of PWI-SC."

We evaluated if they exhibited a difference in the pre-post intervention in the variables attention, concentration, cognitive achievement, acceptance of the authority, level of activity, social contact, emotional maturity and psycho-social dysfunction; according to the level of attendance to the intervention sessions by boys and girls, parents and teachers. In a sample of one thousand three-hundred and thirty-six students of elementary education from low-income areas, we applied a prospective longitudinal ex-post-facto design, with measurements recorded before and after interventions. We computed the ANOVA of repeated measurements, Chi-squared and multiple linear regression. Results showed positive changes in all computed variables post-intervention and in the group where the teacher attended at least one of the workshop sessions. Similarly, the better attendance level of students to the program was associated with better attendance levels of parents and teachers. We discuss and argue about the scope of the intervention and the implications for future research."

This article aims to understand the changes that these rural social-movements have experienced, with a special emphasis on the historical transit of the rural collective action in this new scenario. The proposed hypothesis is that the fight for the land, reshaped from a symbolic and valoric perspective, is still a primary factor in the demands that originate these social movements. The emergence of the new rural social movements is redefined as a dispute for the territory, in other words, the land with a meaning and history. The discussion will be centered on the rural-environmentalist movements in the framework of mining conflicts since these question themes related to territory and identity."

1024,3,"TITLE: Road sharing struggles: Bus drivers’ views on cyclists in Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: Bus drivers; Conflicts between modes of transport; Cyclists; Focus groups; Safety; Santiago de Chile | ABSTRACT: The surge in cycling in Chilean cities is increasing the number of conflicts between bus drivers and cyclists. However, these conflicts have traditionally been ignored by the literature, especially those labelled as minor conflicts, which are not recorded by official statistics. Through three focus groups, we sought to explore the perception that drivers have about the cyclists of Santiago (Chile). The results suggest that drivers consider that cyclists do not perceive their own vulnerability and consider that many cyclists do not respect or know the Traffic Law. In their interactions, bus drivers often generate and abide to stereotypes of cyclists. Bus drivers perceive that the quality of road infrastructure is making their job harder, which potentially creates more conflicts with cyclists. Finally, the main strategy employed by bus drivers to deal with these conflicts is to maintain as much distance as possible from cyclists."
1025,3,"TITLE: An analysis of bus drivers’ interactions with motorists | KEYWORDS: Bus drivers; Conflicts; Driving behaviour; Latin America; Reactions | ABSTRACT: Driving a bus in the city is a task that demands attention to changing road conditions while dealing with passengers’ needs. Bus drivers often experience aggression from passengers and other road users, which sometimes escalate, eventually leading to violence. However, many road conflicts are rarely reported and, hence, difficult to study. This article analyses bus drivers’ reactions to conflicts with other motorists in Santiago (Chile), where public transport accounts for 35% of the total trips. Four percent of the population of bus drivers (639) responded to a survey with questions about job satisfaction, the bus route, and experiences of conflicts and accidents with other vehicles. A Mixed Logit model was estimated to explore bus drivers’ reactions to a conflict with motorised vehicles. The results show that bus driver's most frequent reaction is ignoring and carrying on. If a conflict escalates, bus drivers display aggressive reactions such as violently blowing the horn, insult louder, chucking the bus onto the other vehicle, overtake the vehicle off, or start a fist fight. Being a bus driver with no previous experience of violence with other public transport buses decreases the likelihood of violent reactions, while the opposite occurs with young drivers. Interestingly, the chances of having violent response increase when the driver was female. Public policies should start paying attention to the series of minor conflicts endured by bus drivers in their routines. These conflicts often are not reported to the authorities but nonetheless, exacerbate the chronic stress that bus drivers experience."

It seeks to contribute to studies that suggest that the built environment is highly symbolic, collaborate with the growing number of works that are addressing the everyday lives of vulnerable groups, and enrich Latin American literature about public spaces. The article reports a qualitative and quantitative analysis of forty-two interviews with residents of deprived neighbourhoods in Santiago in which they were invited to converse about the characteristics of public spaces and the activities that take place in them. The results suggest that housing proximity and the quality of public spaces influence social, recreational, and physical activities. Contestation activities are related to the distance that separates people’s houses and the public space. Meanwhile, illicit activities feature diverse patterns and, according to the participants, tend to occupy the public space in low-income neighbourhoods. The findings also suggest that the precariousness of the houses is considered as a factor that contributes to the vitality of the streets; the quality of the public space is seen as a form of inequality, whereas the State is considered as an absent agent that has little interest in the wellbeing of those who live in the most deprived areas of the city."
1027,-1,"TITLE: Women’s attitudes towards electromobility Actitudes de mujeres hacia la electromovilidad | KEYWORDS: Electromobility and gender; Santiago de Chile; sustainable mobility; urban transport | ABSTRACT: This article explores the relationship between gender and electromobility in Santiago, Chile, through a survey focusing on how women adopt electric mobility practices in a carbon neutrality context. The primary aim is to understand women's attitudes toward electromobility and their willingness to shift their transportation habits toward more sustainable modes. The methodology includes a telephone survey of adult women in four municipalities of the Santiago Metropolitan Region: La Pintana, San Miguel, Ñuñoa, and Las Condes, exploring their experiences and perceptions of different electric transport modes. The results reveal a predominant use of the subway (metro train), which is already an electric mode. Regarding other electric modes, although there is general awareness of the environmental benefits of electromobility, the adoption of electric vehicles and e-bikes is conditioned by economic, social, and infrastructure factors. Women in lower-income municipalities are highly willing to adopt electric modes only if economic and accessibility barriers are overcome. The findings highlight the need for inclusive and equitable policies that promote electric mobility, address existing inequalities in access to technologies, and improve user safety perceptions."
1028,3,"TITLE: Bus drivers and their interactions with cyclists: An analysis of minor conflicts | KEYWORDS: Bus drivers; Cyclists; Latin America; Perception; Road behaviour | ABSTRACT: Driving a bus in a city is a challenging task as it demands paying attention to changing conditions (e.g., weather, congestion) while interacting with passengers and other road users who sometimes display unpredictable behaviours. Cyclists play an important role in these interactions. This paper investigates how cyclists are perceived by bus drivers and how conflicts arising from their daily interactions shape the attitudes of bus drivers. A total of 639 bus drivers (4% of the workforce, 91% males) working in Santiago de Chile responded an online survey. The survey asked drivers about their perception of other transport modes, their experience with traffic collisions and the conflicts they have had with cyclists. Later, logistic regression models were estimated, using “coexistence with cyclists” as the dependent variable. The findings show that younger and older drivers have a better perception of cyclists compared to middle-aged ones. Negative experiences with cyclists worsen the perception of co-existence with cyclists; meanwhile, previous cycling experience was unrelated to drivers’ perceptions. The results also suggest that existing norms are perceived as ineffective. Finally, gender was not statistically significant in shaping bus drivers’ perception of cyclists, yet this topic requires further attention as the composition of the public transport labour force is changing."

This article investigates how the built and social environments influence children and young people’s trips in Santiago de Chile. It does so by reporting the findings of a stated preference questionnaire in which children and young people were invited to choose the preferred environment to walk unaccompanied in between pairs of images illustrating different social and physical attributes. The findings suggest that Santiago’s inequalities are mirrored in the environments through which children and young people prefer to walk unaccompanied. Attributes that enhance the streetscape (e.g., well-kept footpaths, grass), provide recreation and natural surveillance positively affect children’s willingness to make unaccompanied trips in wealthy areas. By contrast, those attributes are less significant for children and young people from other parts of the city, where other features have a greater impact (e.g., strangers drinking alcohol, off-licences, vehicles parked on the footpath). Furthermore, young girls are greatly discouraged from travelling unaccompanied in most circumstances, in both wealthy and not-wealthy areas. Public policies should prioritise non-wealthy neighbourhoods, improve the built environment, and strengthen local communities and local familiarity to create safer spaces that encourage unaccompanied trips."
1030,3,"TITLE: Understanding cyclists’ conflicts in the streets of a Latin American metropolis | KEYWORDS: Auto-centric culture; Conflicts; Cycling; Qualitative data; Santiago | ABSTRACT: Promoted by most governments as a sustainable form of transportation, cycling is surging worldwide. Despite the positive impacts of cycling, conflicts between cyclists and other street users such as pedestrians, cars and buses have increased, especially in countries lacking proper cycling infrastructure. This paper aims to understand a series of conflicts experienced by cyclists in Santiago de Chile, where cycling has expanded rapidly in the last fifteen years. To do so, three focus groups were held with cyclists having different levels of experience. The participants were asked to describe the main conflicts with other modes of transport and road users, as well as the coping strategies employed to deal with these conflicts. An inductive analysis ended with four categories related to cyclists’ conflicts in the streets and two related to strategies and lessons dealing with motorised vehicle drivers and other cyclists. The analysis indicates that the unequal distribution of road space negatively influences cyclists’ experiences, who perceive themselves as being threatened constantly by overtaking cars in close proximity, as well as by different forms of verbal and sometimes physical aggression. It indicates that cyclists develop strategies to mitigate conflicts, ranging from making themselves visible at all times, to making use of bodily gestures. However, conflicts can still escalate. The results suggest that, in auto-centric urban contexts, cycling is a challenging chore that happens surrounded by the sensation of having fragile entitlements."
1031,3,"TITLE: Towards a sustainable city: Applying urban renewal incentives according to the social and urban characteristics of the area | KEYWORDS: Densification; Metro stations; Public policy; Santiago; Social integration | ABSTRACT: The construction of new urban transport infrastructure transforms the accessibility patterns of the immediate areas, modifying people's movements and, with that, the demand for land, its uses, activities and densities. In the case of the Chilean capital, Santiago, the underground (Metro), has generated sub-centralities, densification and potentiated real estate development in certain parts of the city, but has had negligible effects in others. Our research aims at trying to enhance the positive effects of a mass transit network such as Metro, to improve two large malaises of the city: its increasing urban sprawl and its unacceptable social segregation. Both problems are not unique to Santiago, but are shared by many Latin American conurbations. To do so, we first analysed and classified the areas around Metro stations, based on their social and urban characteristics, and densification potential. We then identified existing and potential subsidies to promote social integration and densification and, finally, we applied a stated choice experiment to real estate developers to inquire into their willingness to build in the vicinity of selected GIS-classified stations. In a previous paper, we discussed the models estimated with the stated choice data, and the expected results of applying packages of incentives for densification in the vicinity of different Metro stations. In this paper, we seek to identify mechanisms to increase both housing density and, at the same time, promote social integration in the vicinity of Metro stations, by identifying a typology of urban areas that respond differently to such incentives. Our results show that the effectiveness of the various incentives depends, to a great extent, on the urban characteristics of the Metro station surroundings. For example, in stations located in the central areas of the city incentives to stimulate real estate activity are not really necessary, as the process is well underway; however, in Metro stations located in industrial areas incentives are more effective in triggering real estate dynamics, especially direct demand incentives for any buyer or with a limited time frame. Finally, in peripheral Metro stations located in low standard social housing areas, the incentives tend to be less effective and are probably not enough to trigger a significant densification or integration process; hence, probably other type of governmental action, such as pilot or demonstration projects, should be sought for these cases."
1032,3,"TITLE: Understanding cyclist traffic behaviour: Contrasting cycle path designs in Santiago de Chile | KEYWORDS: Cycle path design; Cyclist behaviour; Linear regression; Social evaluation | ABSTRACT: Cities around the world have experienced an increase in the number of cyclists, which has resulted in a demand for more cyclist infrastructure. In Santiago de Chile, each local government is in charge of providing bicycle infrastructure according to its own technical and financial restrictions. Thus, infrastructure dedicated to bicycles has increased, but its quality and design standards differ across the city. This creates an ideal test-bed for understanding how cyclists' behaviour changes under different cycle path designs. The objectives of this research are (i) to explore the conditions of Santiago's cycle path intersections in terms of speed and urban characteristics and (ii) to understand cyclists' behaviour under different cycle path conditions. Some characteristics of cycle path intersections measured were cycle path's length, slope, lateral clearance, physical segregation, bi-directionality, obstacles, and discontinuities. Also, data taken characterise users by gender and use of helmet. Linear regression models were calibrated to explain cyclists' speed using intersection characteristics. According to our model, relevant characteristics were location of cycle path, physical segregation, percentage of female users, slope, and existence of vertical discontinuities. We hope that our results will serve as a guide for public authorities on the design of cycle paths."
1033,3,"TITLE: Designing incentive packages for increased density and social inclusion in the neighbourhood of mass transit stations | KEYWORDS: Densification; Incentives packages; Mixed-income housing; Social integration; Stated choice | ABSTRACT: Local and central authorities have long been interested in taking advantage of investments in mass transit to achieve more sustainable urban development. In the case of Santiago de Chile, a highly income-segregated metropolis that also suffers an increasing urban sprawl, its underground (Metro) and BRT corridor networks offer a unique chance to revert these malaises. In effect, Santiago's modern transit infrastructure is undercapitalized, there are many areas with little or no development in the vicinity of Metro and BRT stations that could be densified providing housing to the growing population, and hopefully even turned into sub centres with urban equipment, servicing the poorer areas, thus diminishing social and spatial segregation. We sought to understand and measure how different government incentive packages could attract private investment into such areas. We used a combination of stated choice and best-worst scaling data to examine the potential power of various government grants to encourage density development, including social integration, at these locations. Our results allowed us to identify a typology of urban areas that respond differently to the incentive packages. The differentiated analysis of the urban areas, their tendencies and perception of potential real estate developers is a significant first step to design ad hoc strategies to encourage sustainable development in the surroundings of Metro and BRT stations."

This limitation is translated into a different mobility, which is enclosed and vulnerable to diverse phenomena such as residential location and quality of public space. In the case of Santiago, Chile, there are considerable mobility differences depending on gender, age and income; emphasizing the higher fragility of low income groups that inhabit the neighborhoods created by the State during the second half of the past century. Through quantitative indicators and qualitative tools, the present paper aims to characterize three scales of women's mobility in Santiago: metropolitan, neighborhood, and local. The evidence shows disparities at all the levels: in the metropolitan scale, high income women perform a high number of trips, and most of them are motorized; on the other hand, pedestrian trips are predominant in the low income groups. In a smaller scale, in the neighborhoods, pedestrian trips are strongly affected by social and environmental factors such as security perception."

1037,20,"TITLE: Automaticity facets applied to screen-time sedentary behaviours and active commuting measured by accelerometers | KEYWORDS: active transport; Motivation; screen time; sitting | ABSTRACT: Background: The time adults spend sitting in front of screens is a health risk factor. In contrast, walking and cycling to and from work, also known as active commuting, could promote physical activity and improve population health. Objective: This study investigated automatic properties role in explaining active commuting and screen-based sedentary behaviours. The stable, daily conditions for carrying out active commuting and screen-based sedentary behaviour are most likely to develop automatic properties. These characteristics mean performing behaviours via external cues (i.e. lack of intentionality), with an unpleasant emotional experience of not carrying out a set routine (i.e. lack of controllability), and without paying much attention (i.e. efficiency). Method: This article describes findings of a prospective and correlational study in which 128 people participated. First, participants responded to questions assessed using the Generic Multifaceted Automaticity Scale (GMAS), which measured the automatic properties of screen-based sedentary behaviour and active commuting. The following week, both behaviours were assessed by daily logs to document active commuting and screen-based sedentary behaviour events, and by an accelerometer, worn for seven days, as an objective criterion. Confirmatory factor analyses, bivariate correlations, and multiple linear regressions were computed for the associations between the GMAS scores and objective criterion measures of screen-based sedentary behaviours and active commuting. Results: Automaticity facets displayed different relationships with screen-based sedentary behaviours and active commuting–people with higher lack of intentionality and lack of controllability for active commuting present higher levels of moderate physical activity. In contrast, the lack of controllability of screen-based sedentary behaviours was a significant predictor of sedentary screen time. Conclusions: The multidimensional approach to automaticity could be useful in determining more precisely the features that need to be addressed to promote the adoption of active commuting and limit the time spent sitting in front of screens."

1039,2,"TITLE: Cultural Semiotic Model for Psychotherapy | KEYWORDS: Cultural psychology; Multilevel intervention; Psychotherapy; Semiotic mediation | ABSTRACT: Psychotherapy, as a cultural activity, faces the challenge of adapting to historical changes and emerging issues. In this article, a multilevel approach to psychotherapeutic intervention that encompasses the individual, relational, and contextual dimensions is proposed. The approach is based on an historical-cultural theoretical framework that integrates constructivist, systemic, and semiotic components to broaden perspectives for psychotherapy. The primary purpose is to integrate concepts derived from cultural psychology to structure ideas related to the theoretical understanding of intervention. A conceptual elaboration is presented to address the extension of the mind into the social and cultural contexts in continuous exchange between the self and others, as an essential vital process. First, the central concepts of semiosis, development, temporality, and dialogicality are presented as theoretical principles that guide this approach. The article elaborates on the cultural semiotic model as a framework to guide therapists’ understanding of the issues prompting individuals to seek psychological consultation and change, proposing therapeutic aims, conceptual tools for intervention, and strategies for building the therapeutic relationship. The relevance of this theoretical proposal for psychotherapy, as cultural mediation cuts across individual, relational, and contextual levels, is discussed."

To identify key conceptualizations related to humanization and dignified treatment, taking into account the perspectives of the various stakeholders at contextual, institutional, interpersonal, and personal levels. 2. To propose a relational model that facilitates the visualization of the dimensions, agents, and practices involved in humanization. A systematic search was performed in the Web of Science (WoS) database, following bibliometric procedures and the PRISMA methodology. A total of 8 articles were selected from the WoS indexing categories of “Ethics” and “Religion,” published between 2010 and 2022. The analysis revealed that ethics and bioethics play a fundamental role in shaping the discourse on humanization and dignified treatment in healthcare. Key themes included respect for individuals’ integrity, relational ethics, associated ethical principles, and concrete institutional practices. The implications of considering ethical notions as foundations for humanization and dignified treatment in healthcare, as well as the proposal of a relational model in humanization applicable to healthcare practices, are discussed."

In psychotherapeutic sessions, we can appreciate the ongoing process of constructing meaning when focusing on a microgenetic level during the exchange of child and therapist. We examine an excerpt from a therapeutic process with a sexually abused child from a socio-genetic perspective, with a focus on the display of semiotic fields, meaning growth and balancing tension and as a mean to deal with the painful consequences.

Ambivalence and tension are essential to elaborate new meanings as well as a therapist willing to accompany the child."
1042,-1,"TITLE: Conceptualizations and instructional strategies on critical thinking in higher education: A systematic review of systematic reviews | KEYWORDS: critical thinking; dispositions; higher education; skills; teaching strategies | ABSTRACT: Aim: This systematic review identified systematic reviews of quantitative and qualitative empirical studies on the promotion and development of critical thinking in higher education students that allowed us to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the main definitions of critical thinking found in systematic reviews of critical thinking in higher education, and what are their similarities and differences? and (2) What are the most commonly used teaching strategies in higher education for teaching or promoting critical thinking, and how effective have they proven to be? Methods: Systematic reviews were selected according to the guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyzes (PRISMA, 2020) and the eligibility criteria proposed by the PICOS strategy (population, interventions, comparators, outcomes and study design), based on 23 records of scientifically identified registers in the Journal Citation Report databases of the Web of Science. Results: The bibliometric and systematic search of reviews of empirical studies on the topic allowed the selection of five systematic reviews. The results highlighted that conceptually critical thinking is related to both dispositions and skills, and that although there is no consensus on its definition, it is established that it is a higher-order cognitive process that can be trained. However, the results show that more studies have been conducted considering critical thinking as a skill than as a disposition, that the immersion approach has been widely used, and that some instructional strategies have shown greater effectiveness than others when the disciplines are evaluated independently. Discussion: Despite the relative consensus on the importance of critical thinking for professional development in higher education, this review highlights some difficulties in conceptualizing critical thinking, in the relationship between dispositions and skills, and in its assessment in academic disciplines."

These newly emerging psychological capacities form the basis for age-appropriate spiritual development because they push youth to move beyond considering only concrete actions and perceptions to deal with the values and broader meaning that social situations invoke. This chapter reviews evidence for brain development relevant to transcendent thought and argues that the neural underpinnings of these capacities present a useful starting point for studying the possible neural basis of adolescent spiritual development. Reviewing evidence that adolescents grow their brains and selves by actively making meaning in and through supportive social relationships and deeper reflections, we posit that developmentally appropriate spiritual thinking may also grow the adolescent brain. Situating spirituality at the intersection of biological and psychological homeostasis, we argue for the interest and benefits of launching a theoretically grounded interdisciplinary research program investigating the neuropsychological basis of adolescent spirituality and implications for education."

This study aimed to compare the religious beliefs and acceptance of Darwinian evolution between two contrasting South American scientific communities (Chile and Colombia), accounting for different degrees and areas of academic formation. In 2018, 115 last year bachelor students (surveyed as freshmen in 2014 for a previous study) from Chile, and 283 first/last year bachelor students, graduate students, and professors from Colombia, all belonging to biology, chemistry, or physics, were surveyed. Chilean students/faculty were significantly more agnostic/atheist, more accepting of Darwinian evolution, and less creationist than their Colombian counterparts. Academic degree and area differently affected these views in both countries, as only in Chile there was a clear tendency among biologists and physicists with higher degrees to hold less religious and creationist views. Marked differences between the history, socioeconomic contexts, and especially in high school and university curricula of both countries might explain these results."

Moreover, little information is available regarding Chilean university scientists' views on religion and evolution. This study aims to provide the first documentation of the opinion of scientists at a Chilean University with regard to religion and evolution. This was done by conducting a personal survey of first and last year undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty. We found that nonreligiosity, as well as acceptance of Darwinian evolution, increased with possession of an advanced degree and this correlation was stronger for individuals who study biology and physics in comparison to those who study chemistry. Although less than 30 percent of undergraduate students are atheists/agnostics, more than 70 percent of faculty members are atheist or agnostic. However, most of the surveyed scientists did not see a conflict between science and religion."

However, current laboratory procedures may affect the recovery of microremains and this issue has not been thoroughly investigated. This study involved the analysis of dental calculus from five Chalcolithic individuals from El Mirador cave (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain) from a methodological perspective. Two sample processing protocols published in the archeological literature were used for this purpose, and results were compared to the El Mirador archaeobotanical record published elsewhere. Analyzed as a whole, the microremains found in the dental calculus samples are consistent with a population immersed in a farming economy, although they are not representative of the richness of the archaeobotanical record of the site. Furthermore, the two protocols delivered different results, in terms of the number of microremains identified, the time required for analysis, and associated contamination problems. This data indicates that the method selected may affect the results. We recommend further research using a larger sample set to fully understand how methodological factors affect the preservation and observation of microremains embedded in dental calculus. We also call for a discussion on the role of dental calculus in archeological research."

Through the integrative review method, 27 academic sources were identified and classified into two main areas of study: writing learning and writing instruction. In the area of student writing learning, research has focused mainly on the analysis of linguistic knowledge (spelling and sentence production) and the evaluation of the quality of texts, mostly in narrative texts, and to a lesser extent expository and opinion. In the area of teaching writing, attention has been focused mainly on understanding the teaching practices of story writing or opinion texts. Less attention, they have dedicated to the study of the practices of evaluation of the writing and of the needs of initial and continuous formation of the professors related to the didactics of the writing. It also highlights the absence of national surveys and observational studies with teachers from other regions than the Metropolitan Region, which provide a more complete picture of the teaching practices of writing that occur in different educational contexts, in terms of teaching and evaluation strategies, as well as the text genres that teachers use to teach writing, in addition to the frequency with which they teach writing, compared to the teaching of reading and orality. Based on a synthesis of results in each area, the review proposes recommendations for future studies of writing in the Chilean context of basic education."

This study assessed the preparedness of 16 Chilean future teachers, with a specific focus on Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) within the cognitive framework of EDS. Using a validated and piloted sixitem questionnaire, the study examined their level of statistical literacy in problem situations related to SDG 5, as well as their pedagogical capacity to teach statistics according to EDS guidelines. The results indicate an urgent need to strengthen these competencies before they begin their teaching careers. The study suggests adopting proven strategies, such as integrating Lesson Study with statistical projects or the PPDAC (Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, Conclusion) research cycle, to design and enhance statistical literacy. This approach could not only deepen understanding of SDG 5 challenges through statistical analysis but also promote sustainable development impact from teaching practice."

For this reason, a mixed methodology is conducted based on the application of a questionnaire on biases and heuristics that affect probabilistic thinking in a sample of 77 students from the Faculty of Administration and Accounting Sciences at a university in Colombia. The results show students have a tendency to provide answers based on biases and heuristics, rather than providing a probabilistic analysis that allows formulating hypotheses or using theory. It is concluded that students express their answers based on probability heuristics and not on probabilistic theory when faced with making decisions."

For this purpose, the activities involving mean, median, and/or mode were identified through the revision of two series of textbooks (16). The units of analysis were (1) type of measure, (2) task, (3) context, (4) support, and (5) cognitive skill. The main findings allowed us to indicate that the texts are aligned with the curricular guidelines, with tasks mostly associated with mean and mode, prioritizing calculation. Additionally, the tasks lack a context that gives meaning to the data. The support in which the data is presented is written and tabular. Finally, regarding the type of cognitive skills with the greatest presence in the textbooks, these are at a basic level."

The objective was to identify the cognitive demand level and progress of ESD by examining the quantity and type of linkage with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the presented activities and tasks. Methodology: content analysis was employed to examine the linkage with the SDGs, the type of content, and the cognitive demand of the proposed activities and tasks. Results: the findings revealed that the proposed tasks in the analyzed textbooks are mostly procedural, realistic, and contextualized within situations associated with SDG2, SDG3, SDG4, SDG5, SDG12, and SDG13. Moreover, it was found that as the grade levels progress, the number of tasks associated with the SDGs increases, and the level of cognitive demand is higher. Conclusions: although textbooks provide opportunities for teaching statistics, probability, and ESD, it is necessary to integrate activities with a higher cognitive demand level of data analysis. This will foster statistical project work and the development of cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional skills from primary education within the context of ESD."

By implementing methodologies such as lesson study and didactic-mathematical knowledge and competencies model, an intervention was conducted with two groups of future teachers: the first group comprised 16 participants, while the second had nine, with the latter receiving an enhanced version of the training cycle. The assessment was carried out using content analysis and tests before and after the cycle, in addition to focus groups with the second group. The findings indicate improvements in pedagogical skills, gender equality, and knowledge in statistics and probability, underscoring the effectiveness of the training cycle. It is concluded that, despite the lack of notable differences between the two versions of the training cycle, it is effective in its educational aim and in raising awareness on sustainability issues."

To this end, a printed recording protocol of natural semantic networks was applied to 16 teachers in training and 58 in-service teachers, selected through non-probabilistic sampling. The results provide evidence that the concept with the lowest conceptual density in both groups is variability. Likewise, a greater presence of similar words was observed between randomness, chance and probability, despite being different concepts. Another finding is the association of the inducing concepts to words that are used within the basic lexicon in Chilean Spanish, whose dictionary is not specialized in statistics. It is concluded about the scarce use of technical language by the participants, which would eventually affect the teaching of statistics."

Theoretical Framework: The theoretical framework is associated with the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Chilean science curricular bases, as well as the didactic management associated with school textbooks. Method: The mixed method is followed, through content analysis, the elaboration of a priori categories, supported by quantitative elements to describe and interpret the data obtained from the analysis of school textbooks. Results and Discussion: The results obtained revealed the presence of activities, still insufficient, that deal with the topic of water in the texts. The highest frequencies of educational activities are found in the fifth and sixth grades. The skills promoted are intellectual capacities (operations to acquire, recover, solve problems and retain different types of knowledge); on the other hand, the skills that demand a process of practice (mastery of the technique or skill), attitudes and habits, such as ways of acting and behaving, are the least promoted. Research Implications: The implications of the study are referred to the methodology of science teaching in Basic Education and the respective teacher training. Originality/value: The results of the study contribute to filling a gap in the literature related to the teaching of water proposed in school textbooks. With this, guidelines are provided to improve the activities suggested in the textbooks, promoting awareness of water, its reuse and conservation."

Objective: To analyse activities related to statistical graphs in natural sciences and history, geography, and social sciences textbooks in Chilean primary education. Design: Qualitative methodology, descriptive level, using the content analysis method. Setting and participants: The sample consisted of two textbook collections for both subjects (n=24), covering elementary school courses from grades 1 to 6. Data collection and analysis: Through content analysis, types of graphs, reading levels, levels of semiotic complexity, and types of tasks and activities with statistical graphs. Results: The results show a total of 105 activities. In natural sciences, reading level 4, semiotic level 3, and the explaining task predominated. In the case of history, geography and social sciences, level 1, semiotic level 2, and the example task predominate. Conclusions: More activities must be included in the HGSSci in the first years of schooling, as they only appear in the 5th and 6th grades, especially if analysis work is encouraged. NSci textbooks include some graphs to be addressed in mathematics in later subjects, so we suggested working the graphs systematically within the subjects."

For this, we carried out a content analysis by applying two checklists to the students' texts, the teacher's teaching guide, and the students' workbook for the 8th grade of basic school in Chile. After the analysis of 50 activities, we found that the questions that focus on the ability to argue and communicate lack collaborative work. This means the students assume a passive role within the work involving skill, since they work alone, without the necessary interaction to generate the development of the skill. It is also evident that the Krummheuer’s model complies with developing this skill, however, elements of the Toulmin Model-qualifiers and rebuttal-appear, which makes the process and work with this skill more complex and complete than is believed. Finally, it is necessary to alter the teaching guide, since it does not develop guidelines on how teachers should work with argument and communication skills in the classroom."

The work with the students was carried out according to a methodology of inquiry and problem solving. A quasi-experimental design is followed, using as dependent variables the attitude towards science and mathematics, analyzed preintervention and post-intervention. The experimental group is made up of 15 3rd cycle students, forming the control group from a matching process with the rest of the students at the center. The findings inform that the implementation of the STEM program generates better results in the attitude towards science (p=,004; TE= 1,254) than mathematics (p=,574; TE=,382) the technological tools used, the work time and the connection process between disciplines in STEM reinforce the work carried out. Finally, the research implies that there is a need to increase the understanding of the interrelationships between aspects of STEM, and the need to develop models of learning based on STEM to support the application of STEM in learning."

In addition, it is present in the school curriculum of various countries, such as Chile. Objective: To analyse the teaching of the concept of randomness in primary education mathematics textbooks in Chile. Design: The research uses a qualitative methodology and uses the content-analysis method. Setting and participants: 42 textbooks were analysed, including student texts and activity logs. Data collection and analysis: Through content analysis, the sections and segments of the textbooks in which the concept of randomness intervenes are studied, relating them to definitions, problem situations, cognitive levels that should be developed, and the use of technological tools. Results: The concept of randomness is introduced through random games and concepts associated with random experiment, chance, random, and sample space, without delving into the definition of some cardinal concepts such as chance and randomness. Conclusions: The textbooks partially conform to the Chilean curricular guidelines. In addition, activities related to the concept of randomness generally refer to the use of physical devices and, on a small scale, to the use of technological tools. Finally, the textbooks present a small number of problem situations with an adequate cognitive level that favours the development of skills necessary for primary education students’ acquisition of probabilistic thinking."

The methodology is quantitative, non-experimental, and descriptive. It surveys 88 future teachers (92% women) enrolled at a private university from the Maule Region (Chile). The results reveal that the strategies most used to address behavioral issues are positive language (22.5%), preventative teaching (14.8%), changing sitting location of students with challenging behavior (12.5%), and re-directing behavior (11.6%). The majority of future teachers show insufficient levels of training, due to limited focus on behavioral management and support in their training programs. In conclusion, university pedagogy degrees curricula should include training and activities that develop pedagogy students’ competencies on behavioral support and class management"

The proposed task involved the function f(x)=2x, with six questions on particular cases and one on generalization. The data was collected through a semi-structured interview to each of the students and a qualitative analysis of their answers was carried out in each of the questions of the task. The results suggest that the two students are capable of approaching the proposed task through different strategies, such as additive and multiplicative correspondence relationship, and covariation. Also, it was found that they use systems of varied representations, being the verbal representation to express the generalization of the functional relationship one that stands out. It is concluded that early childhood education students may be able to tackle tasks that involve algebraic notions that focus on functional thinking."

To respond to this objective, a quantitative, cross-sectional, non-experimental and exploratory-descriptive research was carried out, in which the teacher’s self-efficacy scale was applied in relation to the management skills and behavioral support in the classroom (Teachers ‘Sense of Efficacy Scale, TSES) in a sample of 81 future teachers from different teacher training programs from a university in central Chile. The results show that preservice teachers state that they feel better prepared to address teaching aspects of all students. However, most preservice teachers report feeling less prepared to face the emotional and behavioral challenges of students in the classroom. It is concluded that teacher training programs should generate training strategies to increase the sense of effectiveness of future teachers in the areas of classroom management and addressing the emotional and behavioral needs of all students."

Therefore, this research aims to analyze activities on statistical tables present in mathematics textbooks, published by the Ministry of Education and distributed free of charge to teachers and students of Primary Education in Peru. The methodology is qualitative and descriptive. For data analysis, the content analysis technique was used by analyzing types of statistical table, types of task, reading levels and semiotic complexity levels as units of analysis in a complete series of mathematics textbooks of Primary Education, from first to sixth grade, one per level, due to their wide national coverage. The results allow us to observe predominance of tally charts and data tables, completion and comparison tasks, reading level 2 (reading within data) and semiotic complexity level 3 (representation of data distribution). It is concluded that it is necessary to increase the number and variety of tasks related to statistical tables proposed in mathematics textbooks, as well as to reinforce the presence of the highest levels of reading and semiotic complexity in the last years of Primary Education in Peru."

A qualitative, descriptive level methodology is employed, based on content analysis. In particular, four items that assess aspects of this subdomain of the MKT (Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching) model are reported. The items relate to expressing deep and specific knowledge and to representing ideas accurately on statistical graphs. The results show that teachers commit errors when defining statistical graphs, when identifying concepts linked to bar graphs, and when making calculations and predictions based on the information represented on graphs. It is concluded that future teachers of early childhood education lack specialized knowledge on statistical graphs as defined by Chilean standard guidelines for early childhood education degrees."

The main theoretical bases considered in the study relate to the levels of reading and the levels of semiotic complexity. The methodology adopted is qualitative, that of descriptive level and the method used was content analysis. The units of analysis are type of graphs, level of reading, level of semiotic complexity, task type and the type of context. The results showed the predominance of the counting table, followed by the frequency table; of the reading level 2 (Reading the data); of the reading level 3 related to semiotic complexity (representation of data distribution); of the task of calculate; and of the type of context personal. Tasks related to statistical tables are not part of the curricula at 6th grade in Primary education, whereas counting tables are present in 1st and 2nd grade curricular programs. Finally, it is recommended to include activities by which students can make predictions from the data provided in a table, in which a group of data is being represented without summarizing the distribution, in which more than one type of data distribution is presented, and with a scientific context."

The aim of this work is to analyze to what extent the Primary Education Sciences textbooks in Spain and Chile are aligned with this STEM perspective. Following a content analysis methodology, in the 12 widely disseminated analyzed textbooks, 462 activities were identified. Among them, 164 (less than 50%) are related with, at least, one STEM area. These activities were classified according to the integrated curriculum analysis model, which proposes six ways to approach the integration of an activity.The “linked approach” shows a greater relevance in Spanish (50%) and Chilean textbooks (46%). In adition, the activities were classified according to an adaptation of the environmental education perspective approach. Among 5 existing approaches, the “experiential” (60) and the “praxique” (50) are the most prevalent approaches. The findings reveal the need to increase the relationship among disciplines to achieve a truly integrated STEM approach."

Its promotion is an important task in classrooms both in oral and written contexts. In accordance with the above, this work reports the results obtained in an investigation of the dimensions of the cognitive process demanded by the questions formulated in Natural Science textbooks for Chilean Primary Education students. It was an investigation with a quantitative method, in which the types of questions were classified according to the dimension of the cognitive process the students were demanded. The taxonomy of Anderson and Krathwohl (2001) was used as a basis, in order to evaluate the questions in current textbooks, specifically, in content and in the proposed didactic activities. We worked with the total of questions corresponding to 1256. Among the findings, a highlight was that the questions contained in Natural Science textbooks promote the most elemental dimension of taxonomy, recalling information and, to a lesser extent, the higher cognitive dimensions: creating, evaluating and applying. It should be noted that there are no statistically significant differences among the demands of the questions asked in the texts in the different courses studied."

To collect the data, an instrument was constructed and applied whose reliability was quantified by Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which delivered a value (α = 0.78) that is adequate for this purpose. The sample consisted of 30 teachers in training and 15 active teachers, and it was obtained by a non-probabilistic sampling of the intended type. In general, the results show that active teachers have higher percentages of achievement than teachers in training in relation to identifying random sequences and probabilistic rules. On the other hand, teachers in training have higher percentages of achievement in the calculation of probability in textual statements. In addition, both groups give little plausible argumentation, evincing a training more procedural than conceptual, which would allow an answer to be given regarding argumentative ability. Este trabajo tiene por objetivo comparar el conocimiento sobre aspectos de alfabetización probabilística que presentan profesores en activo y en formación. Para recoger los datos se aplicó, un instrumento construido para tal finalidad, cuya fiabilidad fue cuantificada mediante el Coeficiente alfa de Cronbach, entregando un valor (a=0,78) adecuado para su propósito. La muestra estuvo constituida por 30 profesores en formación y 15 en activo, la que se obtuvo mediante un muestreo no probabilístico del tipo intencionado. En general, los resultados muestran que los profesores en activo presentan porcentajes de logro menos descendidos que los profesores en formación en relación a identificar secuencias aleatorias, reglas probabilísticas. En cambio, los profesores en formación presentan porcentajes de logro superiores en cálculo de probabilidad en enunciados de tipo textual. Además, ambos grupos entregan argumentaciones poco plausibles, evidenciando una formación de carácter procedimental sobre la conceptual que permitiría dar respuesta a la habilidad argumentativa."

The research follows a qualitative methodology, using content analysis only in textbook sections where statistical graphs are present. The level of study is exploratory, therefore it allows investigating the institutional meaning of these graphics in the country. 44 activities are identified and analysed as result of the investigation; it is observed: Bar, pie, and line graphics; reading level 2, this is ""to read into the data""; two kinds of semiotic levels, these are ""representation of a data list without to summarize in a distribution"" and ""representation of a distribution""; calculate, complete, construct, read, and exemplify activities. In conclusion, this research report allows observing, the little emphasis with which this mathematical object is worked in the elementary school. The current view of the statistical graphics is not consistent with the results obtained. Such representations are understood as cultural elements, and certainly, researches suggest that these must be put into action in the classroom from primary education, to ensure that future citizens have tools to interpret and analyse them critically."

Used with a ludic purpose and to make decisions in situations of uncertainty, they are a source of cultural knowledge for the development of statistical reasoning. This study proposes a curricular and teaching development alternative that links cultural knowledge about indigenous people's games of chance and the statistical reasoning expected in the curriculum, in the framework of a pedagogical duo established by a mathematics teacher and a cultural scholar. By means of a content analysis in the modeling of the activities, we studied the assessment of the proposal. The results show that the teachers focus on the equiprobability of the events, leaving aside the complexity of the cultural mathematical artifact, while the cultural scholars estimate the limits and scope of the processes in order to make them coherent with local practices."

It examines how this technology influences the perception, interpretation, and decision-making of preservice teachers, referred to as noticing ability. Based on a descriptive qualitative design, the interactions and decisions of 32 future teachers involved in collaborative statistical problem-solving classes were analyzed. The methodology included four phases of collaboration and reflection, supported by a knowledge management and tele-immersion model using 360° cameras. The results indicated that tele-immersion facilitated a deep immersion in real pedagogical contexts, improving perception and decision-making skills at the level of experienced teachers. The immersion, in synergy with the collaboration between practicing teachers and academic trainers, facilitated an effective transition in several key categories, such as: the role, from student to teacher; the space, from university classroom to school classroom; the knowledge, from general to specific in solving and guiding statistical problems; and the activity, from design to implementation. Despite technical challenges, tele-immersion proved to be an invaluable tool for teacher training, promoting a deeper and more effective integration between theory and practice."
1087,0,"TITLE: Humanizing mathematics education: quantitative and arithmetic argumentation of indigenous cultural practices | KEYWORDS: Cultural mathematical artifact; Cultural practices; Encoding/decoding; Indigenous; Language | ABSTRACT: Dehumanized and globalized mathematics education in the last centuries has led to established learning processes disconnected from indigenous knowledge. The effect of cognitive imperialism, given the systematic negation of the language and the culture, has as a disastrous consequence of the gradual and systematic loss of knowledge and indigenous reasoning. Thus, recognizing, appreciating and updating it turns into a task and challenge for the teaching and learning of math in the intercultural classroom. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to focus on analyzing the mathematical reasoning of the indigenous student while encoding and decoding an historic numeric registry artifact called püron (knot in the Mapuche language). The study was conducted in three schools on Mapuche territory of Araucanía Region in Chile, using the Participatory Action Research method. The results show that encoding/decoding quantities helps indigenous students to recognize structures and to establish a numeration system close to the historically reported cultural practices of the Mapuche people. Moreover, it extends the mathematical quantitative structure and reasoning to an arithmetic one seen in the present day cultural practices such as the measurement of fields for planting. Thus, the experience contributes to the students’ linguistic awareness of Mapudungun (Mapuche language) in a numeration system framework."

The shift calls on teachers, and the plans countries need to prepare to make the changes through well-designed teacher professional development programs. ARPA (Spanish acronym for Activating Problem Solving in Classrooms), as a professional development program, with an emphasis on collaborative problem solving, provides opportunities and tools for teachers to enrich their classroom activities in a student-centered manner. This study of 149 in-service teachers evaluates the impact of an ARPA workshop on teachers’ self-efficacy and their tendency to choose student-centered practices. The results show that before participating in the program, even if teachers had believed in their ability to solve problems, they did not consider how to connect this ability with the active student-centered problem-solving practices in their classroom. However, teachers’ self-efficacy in performing problem solving significantly affects the teachers’ report of their student-centered practices after participating in the program. Understanding the relationship between teacher confidence and the quality of their classroom activities is essential for the optimization of the outcomes of any teacher’s professional development."

Thus, this research seeks to identify relationships between the profiles of beliefs about mathematical instructional practices and the formal and informal experience with the role of teacher. For this purpose, a scale of beliefs is constructed and validated in 328 elementary education pedagogy students from 18 training programs in Chile, identifying profiles through latent class analysis and determining relationships using the Chi-square test. The results show that the teaching models experienced by student teachers influence their beliefs, even more so if they have adapted the role of teacher by teaching a classmate or giving private lessons."

Given that the education assurance system in Chile is under close scrutinity, a correspondence analysis is performed to examine program accreditation years by using the comparison unit KARS (knowledge on school mathematics, activities, role, and space), as an approach to school classrooms. The results show that regardless of the years of accreditation, only one dimension of the comparison unit is observed in the course subjects of all the programs. This suggests that that having more years of accreditation does not ensure having nested opportunities. It is concluded that the KARS’s dimension of knowledge on school mathematics is the only dimension observed across the teacher training programs examined."

An online instrument designed and implemented for Chilean mathematics teachers, with a total of 423 math teachers participating. The instrument is found psychometrically valid to study teachers’ pedagogical-technological beliefs and their remote practices. The results show teachers’ high self-efficacy levels regarding the personal use of technology, but moderate selfefficacy in integrating technology in teaching. Moreover, teachers see a much more active role for themselves than for students in online activities. Gender differences were only significant for teaching practices, where the results reported women as more active than men. Teacher age is not recognized as a factor affecting teachers’ pedagogical-technological beliefs and their remotepractices. Finally, the study confirms a significant influence of socioeconomic context in teachers’ beliefs and practices during the pandemic. It recommends that policymakers need to provide adequate resources and knowledge to support teachers in integrating technologies in distance education, especially those working in the public sector"

Therefore, it has become a relevant teaching tool in schools. For students, however, producing written arguments demands both high levels of cognition and linguistic skills. Few studies exist that have focused on students with these attributes. The purpose of this research is to explore the profiles of student writers with respect to the quality of their written arguments, as well as to establish the link between these profiles and students’ academic language resources (ALR). One hundred and twenty-six Chilean 8th graders from three schools were assigned an essay on the use of tablets in the classroom. The quality of their essays was assessed using a rubric to determine the mastery of their argumentative skills. In addition, academic language resources-academic vocabulary, nominalization, discursive markers, epistemic and deontic markers-were coded using CLAN. An analysis of latent classes (ACL) determined the profiles. A total of 69% of the students displayed attributes of the so-called “emergent” profile. The remainder belonged to the second profile, called “developing.” In these two categories, the use of ALR was analyzed. In the “emergent” profile, there are two classes of students who differ substantially in the use of nominalizations (by presence and/or absence) and cross-disciplinary academic vocabulary. The “emerging” profile also contains two types of students: some with a more homogeneous use of ALR, while others use cross-disciplinary academic vocabulary, nominalizations and deontic markers. The study concludes that students need more opportunities to learn how to build arguments and to deploy academic language resources in order to strengthen their points of view."

In this context, we present a study that allowed us to describe the beliefs regarding mathematics, it's teaching and learning, as well as the mathematical school knowledge corresponding to the levels from 1 to 6, which have the future primary education teachers, considering that it is the mathematics that they should teach in their professional life. This diagnosis was made by applying a pencil and paper questionnaire to a stratified random sample of 511 first-year primary school students from 14 universities in Chile. From this, we develop a characterisation of students regarding their beliefs and knowledge of school mathematics, investigating the relationships between them. The results show that students consider mathematical activity differently, and have greater mastery of arithmetic content."
1098,0,"TITLE: Academic language and the quality of written arguments and explanations of Chilean 8th graders | KEYWORDS: Academic language; Academic vocabulary; Writing assessment; Writing quality | ABSTRACT: Writing is a task that entails high cognitive and linguistic efforts, especially when producing academic texts. Academic language might be one of the factors influencing the quality of written texts, given that prior research has shown its impact on reading comprehension. The purpose of this study is to examine the contribution of Spanish Core Academic Language Skills (S-CALS) and academic vocabulary to the quality of written argumentation and explanation. For this study, 126 Chilean 8th grade students produced an argumentative text and an explanatory text about the same topic. In addition, their academic vocabulary was assessed with the S-AVoc-T test and their CALS with the S-CALS-I test. Results show that both CALS and academic vocabulary are significantly and positively correlated with both writing tasks. Even though these instruments make different contributions to the predictive models in each discursive genre, a Principal Component Analysis revealed that the model that best explains writing quality are those which combine both language variables, namely Spanish Core Academic Language and Vocabulary Skills (S-CALVS). In argumentation, the S-CALVS model explains 29% of the variance, after controlling by gender. In contrast, in explanation, S-CALVS explains 35% of the variance. It is concluded that it is relevant to develop situated writing in each discursive genre and, upon that basis, to work with both CALS and academic vocabulary, because they have a specific impact on academic texts writing."

However, there is little consensus as to how it should be defined and measured. This paper aims to validate a quantitative instrument in Spanish to measure reflective practice in student teachers. To do so, a scale created by Larrivee to measure reflection was translated and administered to a probability sample of 489 student teachers in Chile. The data analysis portion of the study included both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, as well as a calculation of the scale's reliability. The resulting scale consists of 20 items grouped into three different dimensions (surface, pedagogical, and critical reflection), with good reliability indicators. This work offers an operational definition of reflective practice, as well as contributes with a tool to measure it.

However, there is little consensus as to how it should be defined and measured. This paper aims to validate a quantitative instrument in Spanish to measure reflective practice in student teachers. To do so, a scale created by Larrivee to measure reflection was translated and administered to a probability sample of 489 student teachers in Chile. The data analysis portion of the study included both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, as well as a calculation of the scale's reliability. The resulting scale consists of 20 items grouped into three different dimensions (surface, pedagogical, and critical reflection), with good reliability indicators. This work offers an operational definition of reflective practice, as well as contributes with a tool to measure it. The article concludes by discussing the limitations of and prospects for the validated scale."

Nonetheless, research on teachers’ role in problem-solving instruction is both scarce and scarcely systematized. This presentation reviews the studies submitted to the Symposium on Elementary Mathematics Teaching (SEMT) over the last 30 years. It focuses on presentations addressing teachers’ knowledge of mathematical problem solving, and identifying the contributions made to the area by SEMT participants. In addition to providing an overview of research on the subject, the review describes the good practices identified in the pre-service training of primary education teachers, as well as their professional development."

A specific type of noticing was used to describe the decisions of 21 FT when observing the strategies employed by 3 children to solve the equation 6+4= +5. The FT participated in a six-session course on the teaching and learning of algebra, based on video analysis as a means to approach teaching practice. Focusing on sessions 1 and 2, the written responses of the FT to two distinct questions were examined. The main results show that, although the FT's decisions frequently lacked evidential support, their reasoning aligned with specific aspects of algebraic thinking and research covered during the course. Finally, two positions adopted by the FT in decision making were identified: a) arithmetic, centred on the calculations that children should follow, and (b) relational, focused on the interplay of operations through the equals sign. The role of noticing and video analysis as tools to bring future primary school teachers closer to the practice of teaching algebra in primary education was discussed."

The article presents a descriptive-comparative analysis of how rational numbers are taught in four mathematics programs developed in Chile from 1974 to 2012, encompassing from third to sixth grade (ages 8-12). Methods. The learning objectives were analyzed based on the notion of fractions, decimals,andpercentages,followingthestandardssetbytheNationalCouncilofTeachersofMathematics (NCTM, 2003). Content analysis was used as the method. Results. Most of the notions and understanding the rational number are recurrent aspects across the programs. However, they vary in their flexible use, representations, calculation and solving problems processes. Discussion. The observed evolution in the topic is found to be related to social changes and educational policies during the time period."

One of the existing approaches corresponds to a five-year university degree. School mathematics is among the various subjects that make up the formative plans for careers. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to characterise the knowledge for mathematics teaching offered by the course syllabuses related to school mathematics in the initial education of prospective special education teachers. Design: This research is framed within a qualitative approach from a descriptive and interpretative perspective. Specifically, a non-interactive qualitative approach was used. Setting and Participants: Thirty-one subject syllabuses from 12 universities of the Council of Deans of Chilean Universities were analysed. Data collection and analysis: The syllabuses were analysed through a content analysis that combined concept-driven and data-driven development and was carried out sequentially. Results: The results show that the content knowledge focuses on numbers and operations from a procedural and definitional perspective. On the other hand, pedagogical content knowledge focuses on the design of interventions. Conclusions: We conclude that knowledge for teaching mathematics in special education needs to include mathematics educators in the discussion about what knowledge special educators should have."

A curricular approach | KEYWORDS: Curricular analysis; Primary teachers; Problem solving; Teachers’ knowledge | ABSTRACT: This study explores the knowledge required for teachers to teach problem solving (PS) from a Primary Mathematics Curriculum Guidelines perspective. It analyzes six countries’ curricular guidelines for primary education using the Mathematical Problem-Solving Knowledge for Teaching model. To identify the PS knowledge required in each education system, the country guidelines were selected based on the country’s results in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) survey. Data analysis revealed that PS-related knowledge included in the curricula is broad and challenging for teachers. Further, it is not always coherent and research-based. More specifically, the findings show that curricular guidelines emphasize problem classification and solving processes. Our analysis supports the conclusion that particularities in teachers’ knowledge become visible when we view it from the perspective of PS rather than of mathematical concepts."

We develop an analysis of the limitations of the knowledge required for teaching problem-solving published during 1990-2018 which includes these models. This analysis revealed that MKT takes neither the nature of the process nor the knowledge accumulated by problem-solving research into consideration. While the KQ is subject to similar omissions, its major drawback is element overlap. We conclude that the knowledge required to teach problem-solving is not clearly envisaged in the theoretical teachers' knowledge models analysed."

A questionnaire with open questions was applied to 36 Chilean teachers. Our analysis revealed that participants hold a problem' conception related to searching for a solution, characterizing them according to levels of difficulty, as a task with context and for which resolution mathematical procedures are used. The problem-solving process is characterized through phases, with an emphasis on finding the solution and the application of strategies. Effective teaching in this domain is characterized through resolution phases and use of contextualized problems."

Those considerations are followed by a report of a classroom experience in which three problems involving quotative or partitive division were posed to pre-primary school children to determine the presence of otherwise of the respective characteristics. The findings show that the characteristics of pre-primary education problems depend on two factors: mathematical activity that engages children and a structure that favours both their understanding of the problem and the application and verification of the solutions.

1113,-1,"TITLE: Motherhood, disability, and rurality: descolonising practices and knowledge via the Las Quiscas case in Chile | KEYWORDS: descolonial perspective; Disability; gender; motherhood; rurality | ABSTRACT: Women with disabilities face a series of obstacles while exercising their motherhood. Despite the inter-disciplinary studies which have been undertaken on this topic, the ‘modern/colonial/Western/urban’ comprehension of these studies is incomplete and often lacks contextuality. The aim of this study is thus to investigate the life trajectory of a woman with a visual disability, regarding her motherhood process in a rural area of south-central Chile. We used in-depth interviews and photographic records, together with epistemic support from Disability studies, Motherhood studies, Rurality studies, and Descolonial studies. The results provided three categories of analysis: impeding access to dignified motherhood; legal incapacitation: stripping motherhood due to disability; and dehumanisation and loneliness: waiting as a resistance strategy for a conscious motherhood. The conclusions show that exercising motherhood for a woman with disability living in rurality is a trench where the boldest have subverted the precariousness of life. Furthermore, descolonising strategies translate into waiting and passivity as practices which question the colonial comprehension of time."

It pays special attention to the sex-gender-ability system in the social and epistemological organization of knowledge. In this development, we identify a positionality and wasted wealth for regional social analysis and transformation as a result of a modern colonial order. Hence, this proposal is inscribed within the Latin American critical thought to reflect on those other places of abject enunciation."

Objective: To explore and describe strategies used by Chilean activist with disabilities. Method: Qualitative design via three research techniques: a) 11 in-depth interviews; b) six group chat sessions; c) content analysis of eight social networks belonging to collectives of activists with disabilities in Chile. Results: Activists indicate various occupations for revindication as subjects with rights. These trajectories are exemplified with the following dimensions: 1) Interpellate full social participation: demanding justice and citizenship; 2) Showing defective bodies: public mobilisations; 3) Occupying institutional space by placing: bodies in the system. Conclusion: Dissident occupational practices intervene and transform the limited comprehension about what human vulnerability and fragility is capable of. This situation is mainly appreciated in the Global South.

Specifically, it deals with the emergence of the sociopolitical discourses of people labeled as disabled. The intention is to present the construction of the political discourses of dissident disability activists living in Chile. For this purpose, we value these discourses as counter-hegemonic or from the margins; that is, they do not follow the approaches of dominant medical and citizen interpretations. We used a qualitative and feminist methodological approach on the bodily itineraries of eleven activists. This allowed us to further explore the group’s life trajectories, social discourses, and political praxis. The political discourses of dissident disability activists living in Chile are part of the claims of non-standard corporealities to access the public and cultural scene. It is imperative to generate counter-hegemonic discourses incor-porating diverse knowledge in order to advocate for the rights of people who relate to difference and to make visible the structural inequalities that affect subaltern collec-tives. The article incorporates a situated, feminist, and Latin American perspective to address a phenomenon of growing interest in the social sciences, and presents reflec-tions that contribute to both academia and activism."

Objective: To analyze the trajectories of adolescent mothers from the perspective of Feminist Occupational Therapy. Method: Qualitative study that, through in-depth interviews and thematic analysis, analyzed six adolescent maternal experiences in Spain. Results: Three central categories of analysis emerged that explain part of the occupational trajectories. We highlight within them, the “Occupational precariousness: a gender-sex vulnerability”, which accounts for the previous conditions that make adolescent pregnancy possible. The category “A family occupation: (inter) dependent motherhood” reflects the family organization of care and upbringing, giving an account of the relevance of the female figures who support this experience. Finally, the category “The occupational shift: its psychosocial repercussions”, considers the impact of motherhood in the projections, both at the educational level and in its labor insertion. Conclusion: The trajectories of adolescent mothers reflect a fluctuation of emotions and complexities in their maternity wards associated with the period of life in which they carry it out. Therefore, the emergence of a Feminist Occupational Therapy aware of gender inequalities allows us to challenge the occupational injustice faced by adolescent mothers for a more just and dignified life."

Objective: To analyze the occupational impact of unaccompanied youth institutionalized in a protection and emergency service in Catalonia, Spain. Method: Ethnographic study that used as an information-gathering technique: field observations, semi-structured interviews, and informal conversations, which were transcribed and coded through a content analysis process. Results: They brought up three main themes that explain the phenomenon a) The precarious context of the country of origin: the construction of the migratory desire, b) Institutional racism: cultural production of social discrimination and c) Occupational deprivation: as a limitation for autonomy and cultural insertion. Conclusion: The influence of institutionalization is evidenced as a structural factor that limits the choice and occupational participation of young people. This problem takes refuge in a legal imperative of “protection” that ends up reproducing a system of colonial, racial, and welfare discrimination that violates the human rights of young migrants."

We use the novel Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model, capable of handling both aspects of behaviour, on real-world food shopping behaviour data from a clinical trial. We compared the impact of providing general dietary advice, general dietary advice plus personalised shopping advice, or taxation, and combinations thereof, on the amount of saturated fat in consumers’ shopping baskets, using simulation. We used supermarket loyalty card data from a randomized controlled trial of 111 adults with raised cholesterol in Oxfordshire (UK). A Danish fat tax simulation alone is less effective than the tax in combination with dietary and shopping advice. These data illustrate the potential of MDCEV models for these behaviours and, by extension, informing food policies."
1120,3,"TITLE: A study on the factors affecting the adoption of electric buses among the non-Public Transit users in Ahmedabad, India | KEYWORDS: discrete choice analysis; Electric bus; environment; modal shift | ABSTRACT: The transportation sector has been aiming to reduce the carbon emissions by promoting the use of low emission vehicles. Although the Indian electric vehicle market is dominated by electric two-wheelers and three wheelers, various governmental schemes have boosted the inclusion of electric buses within the urban bus fleet. However, it is essential for the transport authorities to understand the acceptability of the electric buses among the commuters who are not using public transport currently. This paper aims at understanding the preferences of non-public transport users, to assess the probability of them shifting their modal choice towards public transport, and electric buses in particular, within the Indian context. The data has been collected through a Stated Choice experiment from 414 individuals in Ahmedabad. It has been observed that the low-income individuals are found to prefer public transit if the buses are electric with an affordable fare. The results indicate that electrification of urban bus fleet can improve the image of the existing bus services thereby facilitating modal shift towards public transit among the low-income individuals who have shifted to other modes of transport due to the deterioration of the service quality of the existing transit system."

This imbalance in the sector suggests the need to develop efficient strategies that can increase competitiveness of alternative modes. However, in Brazil, there are few studies investigating firms’ preferences concerning different attributes of travel modes. This study analyses the travel mode choice decision-making process of shippers in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The main objectives of this article are related to model travel mode choice and characterize freight transport in a Brazilian context. Discrete choice models were estimated using Stated Preference data to identify shippers’ preferences and discuss some possible sustainable policies that could increase the competitiveness of the railway network. Elasticities and probability marginal effects were computed, and different scenarios were simulated to predict the possible effects of implementing alternative transport policies. Simulation results show that shippers’ preferences have low sensitivity to changing factors."
1122,3,"TITLE: Capturing relationship strength: A choice model for leisure time, frequency of interaction and ranking in name generators | KEYWORDS: Hybrid choice model; Name generator; Social interactions; Time use | ABSTRACT: In the past few decades, the travel behaviour literature has devoted increasing attention to understanding the demand for leisure and social travel and the engagement in leisure activities. Some of the studies in this field have adopted a social network perspective, acknowledging that it is mainly the people involved motivating such activities and travel. It is in this literature that the present study places itself. We develop a joint choice model to analyse the share of time spent in leisure activities with each social contact, the frequency of interaction by different modes and the ranking in a name generator. We show that these different decisions are linked by an underlying latent factor that we refer to as relationship strength. As this relationship strength cannot be directly observed, we use a number of different indicators for it in measurement models, including what we believe to be a novel use of the position in which a social contact is ranked in the name generator. The study sheds light on the concept of relationship strength, which is believed to be crucial for understanding social interactions and leisure activity engagement. The results of our joint model are in line with expectations and improve the understanding of relationship strength on the basis of the nature of the relationship and homophily measures."
1123,-1,"TITLE: Women with disabilities and the loss of custody of their children: “Carers, but not mothers” | KEYWORDS: care; Chile; custody; disability; feminisms; motherhood | ABSTRACT: Historically, the motherhood of women with disabilities has been questioned due to negative representations surrounding it. It is assumed that women with disabilities cannot be mothers and, when they are, their capacity to care for their children is called into doubt. According to international literature, women with disabilities are more susceptible to losing the custody of their children. However, in Chile, there is scant evidence about this. Using the paradigm of situated feminist epistemologies, this paper analyzes the experiences of three Chilean mothers with disabilities who have faced judicial processes regarding their children's custody. Three dimensions emerged from the thematic analysis: (a) The role of carers under tension: “Carers, but not mothers!”; (b) The absence of support and reasonable accommodations: The institutional debt; and (c) The influence of ableism on custody processes. The findings reveal a series of adversities that women with disabilities must overcome to demonstrate their fitness as mothers. Institutional ableism hampers due process in cases about the custody of their children. As long as appropriate support is provided and the disabling view is transformed, mothers with disabilities can provide the care and parenting their children require."

Our objective was to analyze GOV experiences and their mental health impact in women with disabilities through a case study in Chile, using in-depth interviews and documentary analysis of social networks and shadow/alternative reports. In their interactions with the biomedical model, women with disabilities are exposed to violation of their sexual and reproductive rights, infantilization, and objectification of their bodies. This negates their subjectivity, directly impacting their self-perception, autonomy, and trust in healthcare institutions. One strategy through which to address GOV involves the collectivization of subjective disaffection in common spaces. It is crucial that healthcare institutions have teams trained to attend persons with disabilities as well as strategies for the prevention and reparation of acts of GOV. It is paramount to foster the social participation of women with disabilities in healthcare matters in order to make their experiences visible in spaces of collaboration with professionals, institutions, and policymakers."

However, there are no studies regarding gynaecological and obstetric violence that this population subgroup may face. This qualitative study is aimed at identifying and analysing the experiences of women with disabilities with regard to gynaecological and obstetric violence in Chile. Methods: From a feminist phenomenological paradigm of research, data were collected from March 2017 to December 2018. Women with disabilities (n = 18) were interviewed regarding their experiences. Data were analysed through thematic analysis. Results: The experiences of women with disabilities regarding gynaecological and obstetric violence fall under three central categories: (a) health inequity in communication, (b) objectification of girls’ and women’s bodies through practices, such as forced sterilisation, and (c) intimidation and discrimination related to maternity. Conclusions: Gynaecological and obstetric violence of women with disabilities is a present form of gender-based violence in Chile. Such instances occur systematically and persistently and lead to the dehumanisation of healthcare, an increase in health inequities, and the creation of particularly complex scenarios experienced by women with disabilities regarding access to sexual and reproductive healthcare. Policy Implications: It is necessary to promote research on gynaecological and obstetric violence faced by women with disabilities, take action against this form of gender-based violence, and improve access to sexual and reproductive services for this population. Specific recommendations aimed at the elimination of gynaecological and obstetric violence are given."

The objective of this study was to explore the barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health in the public health system faced by women with disabilities in Magallanes. Based on a qualitative, phenomenological and feminist approach, 15 interviews were analyzed using content analysis. The findings show that the obstacles experienced arise from the staff, the physical environment, and the health management and administration. It is concluded that there is a need to eradicate these practices that violate rights."

In Chile, as in the rest of the world, the development of studies on this violence is still incipient. Objectives: To characterize practices of violence against women with disabilities in health contexts, and to characterize experiences of vindication of human rights of this group of women in Chile, from the voices of activists and professional occupational therapists. Method: A secondary analysis of qualitative data from a study executed between 2015 and 2020 was conducted. From a qualitative approach and collective case study, a secondary thematic analysis of the data obtained from 8 interviewees was performed. Results: From the perspective of the informants, women with disabilities experience structural violence in a systematic and transversal way, which crosses other various forms of violence: physical, psychological, sexual, obstetric, and symbolic-institutional. The experiences of this group in claiming their human rights reflect processes of emancipation, resistance, and construction of practices that transform these violations. Conclusion: The practices of violence in health contexts toward women with disabilities in Chile is a situation visualized as manifestations of domination and oppression against them, which perpetuate their social exclusion and inequalities in health. Faced with this situation of social injustice, women activists and professional occupational therapists propose the need to implement strategies for the vindication of human rights, together with practices of collective resistance."

This research explores the views of Chilean activists, professionals, and researchers on the factors that favor the continuation of this practice in the country. Twenty-one informants were interviewed using a qualitative approach based on constructivist grounded theory. The main factors that lead to this type of sterilization were the acceptance of sexual violence and the non-recognition of the violence perpetrated, the absence of a protective state, and the dynamics of abuse of power over women and girls with disabilities. It is concluded that forced sterilization is part of a vast repertoire of violence against women and girls with disabilities, which deepens and perpetuates dynamics of oppression, injustice, and social inequality."

This study analyzed the situation of this practice in Spain, from the perspective of activists, professionals and researchers with experiences related to this group. The methodology used was qualitative, based on Constructivist Grounded Theory. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were applied to 22 informants, representing 6 autonomous communities of the country. The participants identified a model of health practices of domination and exclusion, where the sexuality and reproduction of women with disabilities has been the object of expropriation, alienation and contempt by systems, structures and differentiated policies, with little transfer of the global framework of human rights to their reality. Sexual violence has gone unnoticed, becoming naturalized by the environment, and has promoted mechanisms of social exclusion and health inequities, depriving them of their fundamental human rights. As it is a situation that is replicated in various parts of the world, it should be considered an issue of relevance for international public health."

Several authors have examined how the communicative interaction, through the language, can creates realities, shapes identities and to the social world, contributing to the abuse of power and domination. It opens a spectrum of discriminatory possibilities towards certain social minorities, which would incite their segregation and those elements are reproduced through the spaces of the school (Echeverría, 1994; Maturana, 1998; Van Dijk, 1996; 2003; Van Dijk & Bixio, 2009; Magendzo y Donoso, 2000; Barton, 2005; Fairclough, 2010).

The study used a mixed methods (combining qualitative and quantitative methods research) with an approach of Participative-Action Research, applied to four educational establishments in the city of Punta Arenas, Chile, which sample considered students, teachers and authorities. Community-participative techniques of intervention were used and the technical of compilation of information was semi-structured interview and survey. The results were analyzed using qualitative procedures of the Grounded Theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), and the quantitative analysis on a statistical descriptive correlation. In conclusion, this research indicates that a high percentage of discriminatory and non-inclusive language is used in schools of the region, which affects interpersonal relationships and school life, thus violating the human rights of children and young with disabilities. Occupational Therapy has the responsibility of eliminating the situations of occupational apartheid, promoting the occupational justice in those places where discrimination exists in all forms, by the modification of social barriers, to constructing a more inclusive society."

It integrates three theoretical models of the determinants of citizen satisfaction with police work in Chile: demographic, quality of life in the neighborhood, and experiential. The study tested the integrated model using a novel random sample of 996 individuals living in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago. The results underscore the importance of legitimacy centered on fair treatment, respect for human rights, and the perception that the police represent society. The findings are also significant for the Chilean institutional political process and for the Latin American police reform debate."

The daily experiences and relationships of children worldwide have been significantly affected by the Pandemic. It is essential to understand these transformations through the voices of children. The primary aim of this research was to interpret the educational experiences of young children in Latin America during the Covid-19 health emergency. Data was collected through four strategies based on the mosaic approach: face-to-face interviews, virtual interviews, audio recordings, and drawings, involving a total of 46 children from 7 countries: Chile, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica, Brazil, and Argentina. The results show that during the pandemic, there were limitations on play, communication was primarily directed by teachers in virtual settings, children expressed a need for contact with peers, family mediation was crucial for learning, movement was restricted, and here was a greater emphasis on content of the didactic processes. This study aims to contribute to the positioning of participatory research with children as a necessary paradigm for addressing issues that concern them."

Drawing on a post-qualitative methodology, with three datasets of participant observations, in-depth interviews, discussion groups, and inductive thematic content analysis, findings show three resistance pathways building professionalism: 1) Working mother critique and lobbyist creations rebuilding technical professionalism; 2) Babies’ forgotten right to education critique and walkouts for ground-up professionalism; and 3) Nursery marketization critique and dialogic creations for democratic and social justice professionalism. Finally, we discuss how pathways of resistance to UNPP entangle critique and creation to build coexistant technical and alternative professionalisms. Though ECEPAUs’ resistance to UNPP does not transform neoliberal professionalism, it envisions the professionalism of the nursery as a common good, reconceptualizing it in the public dialogue for greater justice from the cradle."

However, there are few post-dictatorship analyzes that investigate justice from early childhood or nursery school education. From a qualitative methodology, Reconceptualist approach and Fraser's theory of social justice, we analyze the themes and types of justice in Early Childhood Education that have been mobilized with the post-dictatorship presidential speeches (period 1990 to 2023). The results show a complex assembly of issues and justices. In these 34 years, Early Childhood Education has been mobilized from three themes: provision, relevance and quality. At the same time, in these themes redistributive justice is predominantly found coexisting with the justice of recognition, while representational justice fragilely emerges. This research invites us to rethink the themes of Early Childhood Education that must be mobilized from presidential speeches, to strengthen social justice that harmonizes the spheres of redistributive, recognition and participatory representation. This is a investigation that makes visible the construction of social justice from early childhood, differentiating and providing the logic of this first educational level."

The centers of the Public Offering Network in Chile guarantee free admission for children from 0 to 3 years old. We examined the institutional framework that financed subsidized centers from an ethnographic approach. Causal mechanisms were identified in the implementation of this policy. For instance, the variability of assistance and the logic of economic control generate practices among administrations, centers and families which promote a right to education and citizenship in early childhood consumption."

However, participation in ECE programs is not equally distributed across social groups. It has been observed in different international contexts that there are factors such as availability, accessibility and affordability that hinder access for disadvantaged families. Chile has promoted policies to reduce these factors: greater availability of centers, priority selection in admission and free tuition. Through 56 semi-structured interviews from 7 centers, non-participant observations for six months in one of the centers and one year of fieldwork, we sought to understand access to ECE. The results show that, despite priority access policies, there are decisions on availability, implementation of accessibility and funding-oriented affordability practices that hinder access. This work provides new evidence and discusses the implications of the results for equitable access to ECE for disadvantaged families."

To do so, this work aims to analyze the concept of causality and its positioning in both the positivist and interpretative paradigms. Next, based on an alternative definition of causality from the critical realism, an in-depth work is developed about the strategies and analyses enabling the production of contextualized and conceptualized mechanisms. In addition, drawing on a qualitative research about school selection, the production of causal explanations and mechanisms will be instantiated through the research outcomes. Finally, this article concludes on the contribution of the critical realism to the qualitative researches, especially in the education field, so as to produce causal explanations."
1139,0,"TITLE: An understanding of school libraries within the technical vocational education and training system: Chile’s CRA school libraries | KEYWORDS: Information digital technologies; information practices; school libraries; technical vocational education and training | ABSTRACT: Our study seeks to explore how official Chilean governmental normative documents envision school libraries within its Technical Vocational Education and Training system. This system has not been exempted from the discursive rhetoric that maintains that for today’s society being able to engage with information is indispensable. While the library has been argued to be a model space for developing such practices, this need not be the case. The role of the library and librarians is not fixed but rather runs within a continuum. Given that libraries’ roles are not fixed, exploring the underlying assumptions of documents that set out standards for libraries is important. Failing to question such assumptions can lead to problematic implementations where discrepancies between rhetoric and practice become common. Within the Chilean context, normative documents as well as teachers explicitly assign the school library responsibility for the development of practices to engage with information. Additionally, in Chile, the enactment of public policy concomitant to school libraries originated from the idea that they were fundamental for developing literacy and practices to purposefully engage with information. Methodologically, we have conducted a post-foundational discourse analysis. Two documents central to the detailing of school library standards underwent a synchronic heuristic discourse analysis as understood by relational-ontology. Findings indicate that the understandings of school libraries are closer to that of a passive annex, or resource, of a school and not as a site for instruction and learning. Our findings indicate that such an understanding slants toward an understanding of libraries mainly conceived in quantitative terms, ultimately leading to the potential thwarting of practices to engage with information."

First, it reflects on the native and non-native dichotomy as pillars to understand its implications on the theorization of L2 speech. Secondly, it addresses the phenomenon of foreign accents and their relationship to the native and non-native dichotomy for L2 speech, taking into accounts cognitive and social variables related to foreign accent as well as critically reflecting on the construct. Thirdly, it discusses bottom-up and top-down approaches to L2 pronunciation instruction in relation to the native and non-native dichotomy and foreign accent. Notably, it describes two different types of instruction according to LaScotte et al.: one that focuses on the imitation of native-like speech, which is labeled as bottom-up instruction, and one that focuses on intelligibility and meaning negotiation, which is called top-down instruction. Later, it explains key concepts for top-down pronunciation instruction, such as intelligibility, communicative competence, and speakers’ identities. Next, it suggests activities to implement top-down instruction in the L2 classroom, which allows for developing communicative competence while considering intelligibility and speakers’ identities in the target language. Lastly, it reflects on the importance of teaching pronunciation as an interactional phenomenon in the L2 classroom."

The research focuses on transparent and non-transparent words containing the grapheme <s> and the phonemes /s/ and /z/ and was conducted in a Chilean rural vocational high school over four weeks, using a quasi-experimental one-group repeated-measures design with convenience sampling. Four students participated in four 90-minute sessions with two different conditions: two sessions for the implicit instruction condition and two sessions for the explicit instruction condition, each followed by a segmental pronunciation accuracy post-test. The results showed that students consistently performed well with transparent words, benefiting from clear grapheme-phoneme correspondences aligned with their L1 orthography in both conditions. In contrast, non-transparent words posed greater challenges across conditions, indicating that the type of instruction does not play a role when it comes to grapheme-phoneme incongruencies. These findings imply that transparent words serve as effective foundational tools for pronunciation, while non-transparent words require tailored teaching approaches to address grapheme-phoneme incongruencies. The limitations and recommendations for pronunciation instruction of transparent and non-transparent words are also discussed in this article."

Contextual factors have been extensively researched, but although internal learner-specific variables have received attention, this has been to a lesser extent. Among these internal variables, L2 motivation and L2 aptitude are likely the most significant predictors of L2 learning progress and listening performance. This study explored the effects of (i) L2 motivation, following the L2 Motivational Self-System model; (ii) L2 aptitude; and (iii) phonological short-term memory (PSTM) on L2 listening performance. These variables combined have not yet been studied with reference to L2 listening. In this correlational study, a listening test was taken as a pre- and post-test in a sample of 104 Year 1 and Year 2 English language pre-service teachers from a Chilean University three months apart. L2 aptitude and PSTM measures were taken using the first two sections of the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT) for the former variable, and a non-word repetition task for the latter. The results suggest that PSTM, but not L2 aptitude, predicted listening performance at time 2. Also, the results indicate that after adjusting for listening performance at time 1, the only motivational factor predicting listening performance at time 2 was learning experience."

The theoretical underpinnings that drive this study are related to evaluation as a learning tool, the principles for an effective assessment and the evaluation of writing skills in a foreign language. Namely, for this case study we interviewed two secondary in-service teachers to understand the factors that influence the evaluation of the writing skills of their Haitian students. The interviews were transliterated and analyzed using content analysis, which allowed for the emergence of thematic categories as well as the most relevant factors considered for assessment of written skills. These factors were analyzed in the light of the assessment literature and in relation to the Chilean educational context. The results point to the need to observe the strategies in-service teachers intuitively use to assess the written texts of their non-Spanish-speaking students and the necessity of incorporating teachers trained in multilingual education into multicultural classrooms, that can promote evaluation as a learning tool."

It focuses particularly on the variables involved in the process of acquisition of reading and writing of non-Spanish-speaking adolescents in Chilean schools. This work aims to present a descriptive literature review that addresses cognitive, social, linguistic, and teaching aspects involved in the process of acquiring an additional language by non-literate adolescents. Although in this paper the emphasis will be on Haitian adolescents who are part of Chilean schools, our general objective is to emphasize early detection of late literacy and formal learning of Spanish as an additional language in Chilean schools in adolescents. Based on our review, we offer suggestions such as the early detection of nonliterate students, the promotion of motivation, and the work with emotions in communication."

This field harnesses data analysis, unlocking tangible advantages for educators and learners. Despite extensive research, geographical disparities in adoption remain, with certain regions still in developing stages. Within this scenario, Latin America has been adopting LA to address specific educational challenges, including reducing quality disparities and dropout rates. However, the region confronts limitations for adoption, such as infrastructure, a lack of widespread data literacy, and regulatory constraints, all of which impede broader implementation. In this context, this special issue, titled “Applications of Learning Analytics in Latin America,” intends to present a comprehensive perspective on LA’s deployment across the continent, highlighting its current state and potential growth. In this editorial, we curate a selection of relevant papers, each delving into diverse facets of LA’s application within Latin American contexts. These papers exemplify practical implementations and discuss the implications and possible future trajectories for LA research, especially tailored for the Latin American academic community."

This also depends on the organizational maturity of the institution and its leadership regarding LA adoption. LA capacity building can follow two approaches: (1) top-down, led by institutional managers; and (2) bottom-up, led by ground-level staff. This article studies two LA initiatives of each type conducted in the same institution to compare the deployment of organizational processes and infrastructure. The lessons learned that were captured from each approach are shared to inform other universities in Latin America on developing LA capabilities."

The population consisted of students from the second cycle of 46 professional schools of the National University of San Agustín de Arequipa. For the selection, an incidental non-probabilistic procedure was used, considering the student assistants when applying the instrument. After applying the instrument and processing it, 13 questionnaires were refined when evidencing errors in their filling, finally leaving 2470 students as a sample. The instruments applied were the Technological Acceptance Model, designed by Yong, and the Escurra y Salas Social Network Addiction Questionnaire. The results show a direct and low relationship between technological acceptance and addiction to social networks since the Pearson correlation is .211, the effect size is 0.4593, and the statistical power is 0.997. It is concluded that there is a very weak type of correlation; however, the effect size is large, and the statistical power is very high."

To improve support for learners in their self-regulatory processes, researchers have proposed technological solutions to transform recorded MOOC data into actionable knowledge. However, studies providing empirical evidence on how these solutions impact learners' engagement with the course and their self-regulatory behavior remain scarce. In this article, we present the results of an observational case study in which NoteMyProgress (NMP), a web-based tool designed to support learners' self-regulation in MOOCs, is applied as an intervention in two MOOCs. The main aim of this article is to provide insights into how the support of learners' self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies correlates with course engagement. We performed the evaluation using a sample of 263 learners and utilized distinct data sources in order to propose indicators for learners' engagement with the course and NMP. Results show a positive correlation between learners' final grades with NMP functionalities that support goal setting, organization (note taking), and self-reflection (social comparison) SRL strategies. Furthermore, we found no significant behavioral differences in how learners with low SRL and high SRL profiles engage with the course or NMP. Finally, we discuss how these results relate to prior work and the implications for future technological solutions that seek to promote engagement in MOOCs."

One approach to testing generalizability of a method is to apply it consistently in different learning contexts. This study extends a previously published work by examining the generalizability of a learning analytics method proposed for detecting learning tactics and strategies from trace data. The method was applied to the datasets collected in three different course designs and delivery modalities, including flipped classroom, blended learning, and massive open online course. The proposed method combines process mining and sequence analysis. The detected learning strategies are explored in terms of their association with academic performance. The results indicate the applicability of the proposed method across different learning contexts. Moreover, the findings contribute to the understanding of the learning tactics and strategies identified in the trace data: learning tactics proved to be responsive to the course design, whereas learning strategies were found to be more sensitive to the delivery modalities than to the course design. These findings, well aligned with self-regulated learning theory, highlight the association of learning contexts with the choice of learning tactics and strategies."

According to existing literature, self-regulated learning (SRL) research in MOOCs is still scarce. More studies which build on past works regarding SRL in MOOCs are required, as well as literature reviews that help to identify the main challenges and future research directions in relation to this area. In this paper, the authors present the results of a systematic literature review on SRL in MOOCs, covering all the related papers published until the end of 2017. The papers considered in this review include real experiences with at least a MOOC (other learning scenarios sometimes claimed as MOOCs, such as blended courses, or online courses with access restrictions, are out of the scope of this analysis). Most studies on SRL in MOOCs share some common features: they are generally exploratory, based on one single MOOC and tend not to specify in which SRL model they are grounded. The results reveal that high self-regulators engage in non-linear navigation and approach MOOCs as an informal learning opportunity. In general, they prefer setting specific goals based on knowledge development and control their learning through assignments."

They are also an important means of disseminating and evaluating the quality of educational resources produced by teachers. The quality of these resources largely relies on the guidelines and policies issued by educational institutions and supplied to their teachers, so that these resources can be created with an adequate level of quality and deployed in different learning management systems. The objective of this paper is to explore to what extent Ecuadorian universities make use of the educational repositories of digital educational material, the specialized repositories of learning objects, and the way in which they have evolved over the last five years. This paper also helps to identify the barriers and the factors that hinder their use. It is expected that the conclusions drawn from this analysis will permit the design of strategies aimed to promote the creation and use of quality digital educational materials."
1153,5,"TITLE: The impact of COVID-19 lockdown stringency on loneliness in five European countries | KEYWORDS: Coronavirus; Europe; Isolation; Lockdown; Loneliness; Social interactions | ABSTRACT: Rationale: The coronavirus pandemic has forced governments to implement a variety of different dynamic lockdown-stringency strategies in the last two years. Extensive lockdown periods could have potential unintended consequences on mental health, at least for at-risk groups. Objective: We present novel evidence on the heterogeneous direct and indirect effects of lockdown-stringency measures on individuals’ perception of social isolation (i.e. loneliness) using panel data from five European countries (Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Sweden), which tracks changes in both in-person and remote social interactions between May 2020 and March 2021. Method: We combine data from the COME-HERE panel survey (University of Luxembourg) and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). We implement a dynamic mixture model in order to estimate the loneliness sub-population classes based on the severity of loneliness, as well as the evolution of social interactions. Results: While loneliness is remarkably persistent over time, we find substantial heterogeneity across individuals, identifying four latent groups by loneliness severity. Group membership probability varies with age, gender, education and cohabitation status. Moreover, we note significant differences in the impact of social interactions on loneliness by degree of severity. Older people are less likely to feel lonely, but were more affected by lockdown measures, partly due to a reduction in face-to-face interactions. On the contrary, the younger, especially those living alone, report high levels of loneliness that are largely unaffected by changes in the pandemic after lockdown measures were initially implemented. Conclusions: Understanding the heterogeneity in loneliness is key for the identification of at-risk populations that can be severely affected by extended lockdown measures. As part of public-health crisis-response systems, it is critical to develop support measures for older individuals living alone, as well as promoting continuous remote communication for individuals more likely to experience high levels of loneliness."
1154,19,"TITLE: Pension Incentives and Retirement Planning in Rural China: Evidence for the New Rural Pension Scheme | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This paper estimates the impact of social pension programs on retirement planning in rural China, focusing on the New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS). Retirement planning is defined as an individual's intention to detach from the workforce at a given age instead of working for as long as physically possible. We also consider an individual's self-reported health characteristics and subjective life expectancy. Overall, we find that the NRPS does not incentivize younger workers (those under 60 years of age) to plan their retirement; instead, they are more likely to remain in the workforce permanently to compensate for the additional costs. However, the NRPS provides a greater incentive for older workers (those 60 years of age and older) to plan their retirement than if there was no scheme. This result is particularly relevant for older unhealthy workers with a longer subjective life expectancy. We also find evidence that mental health status is key for the effectiveness of the policy."

Chile has the highest SSB consumption in the world, very high junk food intake and very rapid increases in these poor components of the diet plus obesity prevalence. This study's purpose is to compare the effect of different tax policies for SSBs and ultra-processed foods on nutrient availability, utilizing price-elasticities, which are estimated from a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model, using the 2011–2012 Income and Expenditure survey from Chile. We take into account the high proportion of households not purchasing various food and beverage groups (censored nature of data) and endogeneity on total expenditures. The food groups considered were: sweets and desserts; salty snacks and chips; meat products and fats; fruits, vegetables and seafood; grain-based staples; ready-to-drink SSB; SSB from concentrate; plain water, coffee and tea; and milk, which together represent 90% of food expenditures. The simulated taxes were: (1) 18% price tax on all foods and beverages exceeding thresholds on sodium, saturated fat, and added sugar and for which marketing is restricted (based on a Chilean law, effective June 16, 2016); (2) 40% tax on SSBs (22% above the current tax level); and (3) a 1 Chilean peso (0.2 US cents) per gram of sugar tax on products with added sugar. Unhealthy beverages and foods are price-elastic (−1.95 for salty snacks and chips, −1.30 for ready-to-drink SSBs, and −1.27 for SSBs from concentrate), meaning that the change in consumption is proportionally larger with respect to a change in price. Results are robust to different model specification, and consistent among different socioeconomic sub-populations. Overall, the tax on foods and beverages high in fat, salt and sugar is associated with the largest reduction in household purchases of sodium, added sugar, saturated fat and calorie purchases. Chile is unique in currently having instituted a small current SSB tax as well as marketing controls and front-of-package labelling of unhealthy foods and beverages. The design of a more comprehensive tax to enhance the overall effect of these policies on healthier diets is a next critical step. This study shows that a tax on the same foods and beverages already delineated as unhealthy by the marketing controls and front-of-pack labelling should promote a healthier diet."

Lately, diverse studies discuss how much objective and subjective indicators are able to characterize some of the above-mentioned dimensions. This has opened the door to some apparent contradictions between different food security measurements that reflect perception (through specific surveys) and behavior (expenditure data). This article aims to extend the food security debate, focusing on the dimension of nutritional quality and classifying food products as healthy or unhealthy, in addition to computing their calorie value. Using a nationally representative database of nearly 6700 households in Mexico, we found that food-secure households (55% of the total sample) purchase an overall food basket that is 0.7 items less diverse, spend $85 Mexican pesos per week more, and show no significant difference in terms of purchased kcals compared to food-insecure households. After controlling for confounding factors, we found that food-secure households purchase a wider variety of healthy food items (and a smaller variety of unhealthy food items), spend more money on food, and purchase more calories in healthy food items compared to food-insecure households. Therefore, with this article, we enhance the relevance of the nutritional quality of food purchases in the food security debate."

HPU initiatives exist worldwide, yet information on how universities translate the HPU concept into actions is scarce. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing the implementation of HPU initiatives in Ibero-American universities. Semi-structured interviews were held with seventeen representatives of universities in Ibero-America that had implemented an HPU initiative. All interviewees had been involved in the initiative and had occupied a position of responsibility for at least 1 year before the study. The interviews were carried out remotely, and the data were analyzed using an inductive approach. The main factors influencing the implementation of an HPU initiative were political support by the university authorities, coordination structure, funding, collaboration inside and outside university and participation of the university community. Among them, political support by the university authorities was considered the most important, although some initiatives succeeded without it and managed to obtain support during the implementation process. This study is one of the first to investigate the factors influencing the implementation of the HPU concept. A better understanding of these factors would enable universities to address them to develop the HPU initiative in the best possible conditions."

This study explored the way in which 54 universities from 25 countries across the world implemented the HPU framework. An online questionnaire was used to assess the action areas and items of work addressed by the universities and to determine their adherence to the components of the HPU framework: use of the whole systems approach; multiservice collaboration; recognition by the university authorities; funding availability; membership of a HPU network and evaluation of the initiative. The results showed that these components were addressed by most universities. A Multi Correspondence and cluster analysis identified four types of universities based on the implementation of the components: 'emerging' HPUs that are not recognized by the university authorities and tend to not apply the whole systems approach or evaluation of the initiative, and 'established' HPUs that are recognized by the authorities, apply the whole systems approach and evaluate the initiative but that differ with regard to funding and membership of a HPU network. These results demonstrate that universities implement the HPU framework for action differently in order to become a Health Promoting University."

Lobbying at the failed Chilean constitutional convention | KEYWORDS: Constitutional convention; Informational models; Interest groups; Lobby | ABSTRACT: What explains whom to lobby in constitutional assemblies or conventions? We present a model that leads to the expectation that ideological, social and ethnic affinities may induce deliberations among allies and acquaintances. We examine the case of Chile and test the implications of our model with data on lobbying exchanges at the failed Constitutional Convention (2021–2022). The results show that cause lobbies (i.e., environmentalists, sexual and gender minorities, human rights) focus more on leftists’ delegates of the Constitutional Convention. Meanwhile, sectional lobbies (i.e., companies, economic groups) avoid more extreme leftists’ representatives. Against our expectation, previous ties to social movements and reserved seats do not anticipate more lobbying from those groups."

To achieve this goal, political entrepreneurs and anti-trade lobbies opposed the CPTPP are using a distinct strategy to shape the debate. The idea of trade politicization helps understand how these key actors expanded the scope of topics, mobilizing political action from various groups such as environmentalists, unions, indigenous activists, and advocates for gender equality. Furthermore, this strategy involves shifting the discourse away from the traditional dichotomy of free trade versus protectionism and redirecting the debate toward ideological and cultural dimensions such as legitimacy and sovereignty."
1161,7,"TITLE: Strategies, access and influence: a survey of interests groups in Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Interest groups; Lobby; Survey | ABSTRACT: How do lobbies and interest groups achieve their goals? To answer that, this article explores jointly the three dimensions of the lobbying dynamic: strategies, access and influence. We test several hypotheses with evidence from an original and pioneer survey with interest groups and lobbyists from Chile. Our results show that cause-oriented lobbies are more likely to embrace indirect lobbying strategies. We also examined access. We found that lobbies declare that it is more effective to direct their persuasion efforts towards convincing legislators who are not yet decided. They do so instead of focusing either on the representatives that already agree with them, or enemies. On influence, our results show that most business groups assert that legislators prefer constituents’ input over theirs. Also, they perceive themselves as losing policy battles more often in comparison with other groups."
1162,-1,"TITLE: When Do Interest Groups Lobby Legislators in Strong Presidential Systems? | KEYWORDS: gatekeeping; legislative activity; lobbying; strong presidential system | ABSTRACT: When do interest groups target legislators to approach or lobby under strong presidentialism? This article explores two hypotheses. First, interest groups and lobbyists seek to access committee chairs with gatekeeping power, even in those jurisdictions where the executive holds (most) exclusivity to initiate legislation (Gatekeeping Hypothesis). Second, interest groups and lobbyists target legislators who introduce more bills on issues that concern them but only on policy areas outside the executive's exclusive sphere (Legislative Activity Hypothesis). We test these hypotheses with evidence from the Chilean Chamber of Deputies. We have coded and analysed 6479 lobbying audiences and over 2300 bills."
1163,7,"TITLE: Constituency Service and Representation: The Effects of Remoteness and Social Deprivation | KEYWORDS: Chile; Constituency service; deprivation; legislators; remoteness | ABSTRACT: This note examines and tests the determinants of constituency service in the Chilean Chamber of Deputies. We argue that socio-demographic factors lead towards differences in the provision of constituency service. We use a new data set of meetings between legislators, constituents, and groups to provide evidence for two main hypotheses. First, Chilean deputies from more remote districts devote a higher proportion of their meetings to addressing local or personal issues from constituents (Centre-Periphery Hypothesis). Second, deputies from districts in worse socio-economic situations also provide relatively more constituency services of this type (Social Deprivation Hypothesis)."
1164,7,"TITLE: Electoral vulnerability and localism under two electoral regimes: the case of Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This article seeks to test empirically to what extent localist behavior by legislators is influenced by electoral vulnerability in Chile, following a recent electoral reform. Our results show that such a relationship exists in the case of non-legislative speeches delivered in the Chamber of Deputies, but not in the case of personal meetings held by parliamentarians with constituents. Furthermore, we found that the relationship between electoral vulnerability and a focus on local issues depends on district magnitude. By examining pre- and post-reform periods, after district magnitude was increased while preserving proportional rules, we also show that incentives to cultivate personal votes are more nuanced under the reformed system."

The case of the CPTPP in Chile Quando é que os grupos empresariais adotam o lobbying externo na política comercial? O caso do CPTPP no Chile | KEYWORDS: CPTPP; outside lobbying- business groups; trade policy | ABSTRACT: Literature shows that business interest groups have fewer incentives to embrace outside lobbying in trade policy. This article proposes an alternative explanation. As we discuss, special economic interests are more likely to adopt a specific subtype of outside lobbying (press, media appearances and op-eds) when policymakers are not responsible for them, and their long-term interests associated with a model of open trade are potentially threatened. We test our argument with the case of Chile and the long debate around the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) ratification process. Our results support the hypothesis: businesses have a greater probability of media appearances, publishing op-eds, and the like, in comparison to other lobbies, such as labor and single-issue groups against the treaty. However, the effect is conditional to salience: the subtype of outside lobbying from business groups is more likely to be observed as the distance to the social outbursts of October 2019 increases."
1167,-1,"TITLE: Hyper-Presidentialism under Question: Evidence from Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Determining the level of power amassed by a president has proven to be a highly complex task due to the multiple factors that make up its sources, use, and variation. This has been a key issue when discussing institutional design and reforms in Latin America, where intellectuals and politicians often label their political systems as hyper-presidential: those in which the president concentrates excessive power. This chapter examines whether it is accurate to categorise Chile’s political system as hyper-presidential, as it is usually claimed, and how this view affected the drafting of a new Constitution. Based on historical and comparative data, our analysis rejects the existence of hyper-presidentialism in Chile. Since hyper-presidentialism - in Chile and elsewhere - has been mostly defined in terms of presidents’ formal prerogatives, it was not surprising that the constitutional proposal drafted by the Constitutional Convention (2021-2022) limited them. However, the proposal, at the same time and contrary to initial expectations, incentivised the concentration of power around the chief executive when considering the changes introduced to the legislative branch and presidential re-election. The case of Chile illustrates how ideas about the political system - even if mistaken or inaccurate - may significantly affect processes of constitution making."

We hand-coded over 7000 parliamentarians’ bills introduced in the Chilean Chamber of Deputies between 1990 and 2020. Our results show, first, that female legislators are more active than men in sponsoring bills that favour women’s interests, especially regarding feminist claims. Secondly, we find that female parliamentarians from leftist parties are more likely to embrace feminist claims in their bills than female legislators from right-wing parties. By contrast, women from the right initiate more often bills associated with women’s traditional role."

Sponsorship as a signal | KEYWORDS: bill sponsorship; information aggregation; intra-legislative signalling; legislative success; parliamentarians’ bills; reactive legislatures | ABSTRACT: This article offers an empirical test of why some legislators’ bills are more likely to move forward in the legislative process. We argue that who signs the bill matters when it comes to the level of support that the proposal receives. Successful bills will be sponsored by a greater number of members (bandwagon factor) and political adversaries (support across the aisle factor). On the contrary, failed initiatives will be those sponsored by inexperienced parliamentarians (newcomers factor). We examine the case of Chile and test the expectations with legislative data on parliamentarians’ bills."
1170,-1,"TITLE: When do Legislators Respond to their Constituencies in Party Controlled Assemblies? Evidence from Chile | KEYWORDS: Constituency Focus; District Representation; Parliamentarians'; role | ABSTRACT: Previous research suggests that legislators respond to their constituencies when they are vulnerable electoral candidates. This article argues that the legislators that focus on their constituencies (perhaps at the expense of the broader national constituency) will be born and raised in the region where their district is located (biographical factors), junior members of the assembly (intraparty position), and from thinly populated districts (district density). I analyse new data from the Chilean Chamber of Deputies that supports these theoretical expectations. These findings have implications for our understanding of political representation and when legislators represent their districts."
1171,7,TITLE: Who is ready to climb the hill? The effect of legislative activity on promotion to higher offices in Chile | KEYWORDS: intra-party politics; Legislative activity; progressive ambition | ABSTRACT: Previous research suggests that bill initiation is a mechanism used by legislators to foster personal votes. This article puts forward a theory whereby legislative activity is understood as a form of party service. Bill initiation records are used by parties to inform their decisions on who is ready to be promoted. The theory is evaluated using an original data-set from the Chilean Chamber of Deputies. Our empirical findings make a strong case for the hypothesis according to which parties reward those deputies who have shown to be effective legislators.
1172,25,"TITLE: Populism in Latin America. A review about Literature and its present Populismo en América latina. Una revisión de la literatura y la agenda | KEYWORDS: Conceptualization; Neopopulism; Party system; Populism | ABSTRACT: Defining populism remains a pending issue in the study of Latin American politics, despite which, populism returns frequently to the research agendas. In this bibliographical study examines the major approaches, perspectives and definitions to define the study of populism. As noted in the review of the literature, the challenge lies in conceptualizing addressed. The attempt to develop the concept of populism as a category of study suggests high levels of difficulty in its use as a heuristic tool. Approaches that support each of the looks come from different areas in different historical sequences, which has led to some literature to argue that populism is more responsive to a political phenomenon with no precise doctrinal contents, which features a political category clearly defined. In that sense, populism can still be a useful approach in the study of politics in the region, since some theories and criteria for analysis provided by the Political Science from Western Europe and the United States are difficult to export to study democracy in Latin America, while populism gives us clues about the political process in countries like Venezuela and other democracies whose precarious levels of institutionalization favor the emergence of potentially populist outsiders."
1173,5,"TITLE: Validation of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory in Chilean older people | KEYWORDS: Anxiety; Older people; Reliability; Validity | ABSTRACT: Objective: Currently in Chile there is a lack of validated tools for measuring anxiety in the elderly population. Considering this, the purpose of this study was to validate the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) in the country. Method: An analysis of the psychometric properties of the GAI was carried out, using a non-clinical sample of 301 older adults in the Metropolitan and Valparaíso regions of Chile. Older people were asked about anxiety, rumination, depression, well-being and sociodemographic data. Results: An excellent internal reliability was obtained with a Cronbach score of 0.931. An adequate convergent validity was observed with the Depression scales (CES-D) (Rho = 0.549, p <.01), Rumination (RSS) (Rho = 0.618; p < 0.01) and Experiential avoiding (Rho = 0.485; p < 0.01). On the other hand, the discriminant validity of the psychological well-being scale presented a negative correlation of Rho = -0.699 (p < 0.01). Finally, and Exploratory Factor Analysis was made, revealing a one-dimensional model of the instrument. Conclusion: The Geriatric Anxiety Inventory has very good psychometric properties measuring anxiety in elderly people, being an adequate instrument for the screening of anxiety on this population."

Studying the value households assign to continuous water supply may help design more effective policies. Using a unique primary dataset from Guatemala City (n = 567), we estimate hedonic models of rental prices to derive marginal values of fewer water service interruptions and in-home water storage infrastructure. Results indicate that, on average, rental prices decrease by 0.7% with each day of water service interruptions and increase by 10% for housing units with storage infrastructure relative to those without it."

In this article, we explore the state of FEW nexus research in Guatemala to highlight progress while also pointing out future research needs. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published on this topic from January 2000 to May 2020. Articles were reviewed and classified to identify the Guatemalan study location, type, topic, and data sources. Only a limited number of studies explored the interconnectedness of FEW systems; 26% of articles (36 out of 138) focused on two aspects of the FEW nexus, while 20% (27 out of 138) focused on all three aspects. Water issues were the most commonly studied, with drinking water, hydroelectricity, and wastewater management being frequently discussed. We also identified a low rate of primary data generation, with only 42% articles (58 of 138) generating new data, and greater emphasis of nexus research in the grey literature. The Guatemalan FEW connections revolve primarily around three separate yet related spheres: clean water and sanitation, climate change and renewable energy, and urbanization and modernization. Further expanding initiatives that simultaneously address these three spheres would yield improved understanding of the interconnected roles that food, energy, and water play in improving the resiliency of natural resources and reducing multidimensional poverty in Guatemala."
1176,14,"TITLE: Natural resource rent allocation, government quality, and concession design: The case of copper in Chile | KEYWORDS: Concessions; Copper; Natural resources; Present-value; Rent; Rent allocation | ABSTRACT: Rent allocation is key to natural-resource rich countries' development. A life cycle model is used to study optimal rent allocation considering the uncertainties derived from government quality and rent measurement. Chile's private copper industry is used as a case study. Results show that between 1988 to 2018 roughly USD 161.7 billion of copper rent has been allocated to the private sector, which accounts for 62.6% of the total rent generated by the industry. Given the quality of Chile's government (i.e., level of accountability, political stability, effectiveness, regulatory quality, control over corruption, and adherence to the rule of law), rent allocation has likely been suboptimal and institutional change is likely warranted."

The results show that, in general, teaching practices are congruent with the scientific evidence related to the processing of these musical aspects. Finally, the use of elements that facilitate synchronization or constant pulse is suggested: optimal tempi ranges for adults, use of binary meters, and the use of rhythmic patterns that prioritise the double-half relationship."

In this aspect, fact-checking organizations (known as fact-checkers) also play a relevant role in denying all types of hoaxes and fake news. Therefore, this article aims to know the vision of the people who work within these organizations on media literacy and their role in the face of disinformation. Using empirical research techniques that combine observation and analysis of a series of personal interviews, this study will investigate the perceptions, opinions and assessments of these organizations on media literacy as a tool to combat disinformation. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with journalists from the data verification agencies of each of the countries mentioned below: Chequeado (Argentina), Colombiacheck (Colombia), Fast Check CL (Chile) and Aos Fatos (Brazil), all of them signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). In addition, the main media literacy strategies developed by these fact-checkers and published on their websites are presented, trying to identify common patterns in their strategies. The results of the interviews indicate that media literacy is a strategy considered fundamental by fact-checkers in South America. These entities consider that, although their main task is verification, media literacy seems to be the most appropriate solution to combat disinformation and therefore carry out a variety of actions ranging from workshops and conferences to resources, guides or tools hosted on their websites."

The comparison showed an increase in tweeting rates in second screening, while TV shows stopped managing their official accounts. This behavior shows a growing autonomy of both screens, consistent with Jenkins' convergency concept: Making connections among dispersed media contents."
1180,11,"TITLE: Media Education Challenges in a Digital Society: The Case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile government; Digital agenda; Media and information literacy; Media education; UNESCO | ABSTRACT: The executive council of UNESCO claims that media and information literacy (MIL) constitutes a concern for the entire world, due to the primary role of information, technology, and media in everyday life and in participating in every aspect of public life. However, in Chile, media education (ME) is not included in the school curriculum or in teacher training at universities. This chapter discusses the opportunities for ME in Chile. The Chile government is reviewing the digital agenda and has deployed five axes: developing a normative frame for the digital environment, expanding quality digital connectivity, digital government, promoting the development of a digital economy, and education quality. Some initiatives exist in Chile in terms of public policies for ME. They show the potential for integrating it in formal and informal settings. Securing ME and MIL in early education and continuing education for teachers is crucial but also needed for other professionals related to education."

For this purpose we used a mixed methods approach, combining a focus group and national survey. The study yielded five major findings: 1) The more comments users read in social media the higher the effect on their television behavior, 2) Open television is discussed more than cable, on demand, and webcasting, 3) The most discussed topics are humor and informational subjects, 4) Facebook and Twitter are the most commonly used platforms to comment about television, 5) While Facebook is the most used site to learn about what friends are viewing on television, Twitter is the most used site to learn about what the general public thinks about television content."

The aim of this study was to characterize young gay and lesbian people’s subjective construction of their experience of having lived and survived a suicidal process. Qualitative interviews were conducted and analyzed as products based on life events. In the participants’ accounts, we identified hostile contexts associated with suicide, trajectories associated with gay/lesbian identification processes, and milestones related to victimization experiences as part of the intentionality and rationality of suicide."
1184,4,"TITLE: ASTRONOMY AND ENERGY JUSTICE IN THE ATACAMA DESERT | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The remote location and prime astronomical conditions of the Atacama Desert in Chile make it an ideal location for building observatories. However, the reliance on fossil fuel power generation raises concerns about climate change and fuel price fluctuations. As a result, there is a growing need to power off-grid telescopes with renewable energy sources. This chapter employs a participatory multi-criteria analysis to examine the energy justice implications of a renewable energy system for the planned observatory AtLAST in the Atacama Desert. The observatory also seeks to provide “clean” electricity to the neighboring San Pedro de Atacama (SPA) community, making it the first astronomy site to investigate alternative energy supply options for the community. The results indicate a strong interest in a renewable energy system that could reduce astronomical emissions in the area by 17-23 ktCO2eq while lowering energy costs for nearby populations. Furthermore, involving the community through workshops and considering their energy needs when designing renewable energy scenarios has proven to be an effective way of promoting procedural justice. However, the findings also highlight the challenges caused by different ontologies, financial constraints, political interests, and power imbalances, which hinder the efforts to achieve energy justice. The study further reveals that the scientific community often overlooks the well-being of nearby communities where research is conducted, which can exacerbate climate change-related inequalities and neglect the voices and responsibilities of these communities. The chapter, therefore, aims to provide a nuanced example of how scientific research activities can benefit from low-carbon energy transitions by reducing operating costs and optimizing energy use while also contributing to recognizing the voice and responsibilities toward the communities where their research is carried out."

However, there seems to be no parallelism of this argument with respect to time. Kant does not explicitly present temporal incongruent counterparts. However, Roberto Torretti argues that there is an analogous argument. This argument is found in the Inaugural Dissertation of 1770. Thus, Torretti introduces a challenge for Kantian studies: Is there a parallel argument from incongruent counterparts applied to time? The aim of this paper is to answer this question."

A key element of the reach of the students was the intensive use of online platforms as a means of organization, dissemination, and debate. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analize the ""online trust networks"" Tilly's concept penetrated by procedures of the online society and the use of the internet, focusing on a particular form of collective action, that of flash mobs. The methodology used is qualitative analysis, using semi-structured interviews and focus groups with the leaders and organizers of the flash mobs, as well as leaders of the student movement in general. As a result of this exploratory research, ""online trust networks"" configured from online platforms that make it possible to link unknown individuals together around a common goal are observed. These specific-online trust networks? of the flash mobs arise quickly, with strong ties for their execution but weak in their permanence and dissolution."

An interpretive case study was conducted with data collected through classroom observations, interviews, and questionnaires, and these data were then analyzed through triangulation. The findings showed that these teachers, who are the most qualified within the region's context, consider geography to be marginal knowledge in the school curriculum, although they also consider it relevant to the education of their pupils. Both elements provided evidence of the fragility of their geographical knowledge, which fell within a spectrum that combines expert knowledge and lay knowledge."

Chilean Teachers’ Views on Teaching Geography | KEYWORDS: Anthropogenic Element; Class Observation; Geographical Knowledge; Geographical Space; Spatial Experience | ABSTRACT: This chapter aims to contribute to the body of knowledge in geography teaching on the nature of and challenges to developing geographical thinking in Chilean schools. The discussion that follows first identifies the kinds of geography subject knowledge taught in Chile and second identifies the pivotal role of the way in which teachers perceive and develop their own geographical thinking and how this translates into their classroom practice. We performed lesson observations and interviews with forty-nine geography teachers in Chile across two networks: Teachers of Teachers and Rural Micro Centres. Findings, show that there is a strong tension between teacher training, and teachers’ own learning as in-service teachers. The paper concludes that developing geographical thinking in Chilean schools is influenced by a complex range of inter-related factors including the quality of teacher geography knowledge, their different interpretations of geography knowledge and their application of these in classroom practices."

1190,1,"TITLE: Breaking the Bronze Ceiling: Women, Memory, and Public Space | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Breaking the Bronze Ceiling uncovers a glaring omission in our global memorial landscape-the conspicuous absence of women. Exploring this neglected narrative, the book emerges as the foremost guide to women's memorialization across diverse cultures and ages. As global memorials come under intense examination, with metropolises vying for a more inclusive recognition of female contributions, this book stands at the forefront of contemporary discussion. The book’s thought-provoking essays artfully traverse the complex terrains of gender portrayal, urban tales, ancestral practices, and grassroots activism―all anchored in the bedrock of cultural remembrance. Rich in the range of cases discussed, the book sifts through multifaceted representations of women, from Marians to Liberties, to handmaidens, to particular historical women. Breaking the Bronze Ceiling offers a panoramic view of worldwide memorials, critically analyzing grandiose tributes while also honoring subtle gestures―be it evocative plaques, inspiring namesakes, or dynamic demonstrations. The book will be of interest to historians of art and architecture, as well as to activists, governmental bodies, urban planners, and NGOs committed to regional history and memory. More than a mere compilation, Breaking the Bronze Ceiling epitomizes a movement. The book comprehensively assesses the portrayal of women in public art and offers a fervent plea to address the severe underrepresentation of women in memorials.

The controversial nature of the monument's meaning presents us with a problem with regard to its verisimilitude and its incorporation into a shared history. It may be suggested that the historical meaning of a monument is manifested in its commemoration and in corporal uses and practices."

The study also proposes to define the role that developmental language disorders play in this relationship. A non-experimental, cross-sectional, and correlational study was carried out with 76 second graders: 26 diagnosed with a developmental language disorder and 50 with normal language development. The children were given a reading comprehension test and two tests of prosodic awareness. The results show significant differences between the two groups in reading comprehension and prosodic stress awareness, and a significant correlation between prosodic stress awareness and reading comprehension. The prosodic stress awareness variable together with the variable of developmental language disorder predict performance in reading comprehension."

Through the analysis of the songs published by the workers’ press and the songbooks which collected them afterwards, this article delves into the song repertoire of socialist-communists and anarchists, presenting diffe-rences and similarities. Alongside poetry and drama, song became one of the most extended uses when socializing and critically occupying public spaces. In this sense, it is suggested that this exercise in composition and performance allowed them to spread proposals of an alternative culture drawing on common feelings of exploitation and emancipation utopias."

However, from 1912 to 1919 no attention was paid to the peasants. The absence of a political and trade union strategy for the peasantry was reversed in the early 1920s, when this Party promoted the creation of peasant unions affiliated in the Chilean Workers' Federation. Through the analysis of different types of documents, this article support as a hypothesis that the process of politicization and unionization of rural workers was due to the mobilization capacity of the Socialists in the central zone of the country."

This study examines the adaptation behavior of farmers confronting a prolonged period of water scarcity for a sample of 235 farmers in Central Chile. A latent class analysis (LCA), a method specifically developed to uncover latent subgroups within a population, was employed to identify distinct classes of farmers’ behavior regarding their implementation of strategies to deal with water scarcity and to explore the factors influencing their adaptation actions. The findings reveal heterogeneous behavior among farmers, with three distinct adaptation strategies. The first class implemented short-term agronomic adjustments, primarily by reducing the cultivated area under irrigation, primarily influenced by water scarcity and bonding social capital. The second class uniquely reduces irrigation applications. Finally, the third class comprises on-farm long-term investments, such as modern irrigation systems and water infrastructure, driven by perennial crops and bridging networks. Furthermore, the high rate of non-adoption of long-term strategies (61%) underscores the need for better targeted policies that address farmers’ needs and heterogeneity by promoting more efficient irrigation management and agricultural practices, as well as enhancing adaptation to climate change in water-scarce environments."

In bioarchaeology, few studies about foot anomalies include population comparisons and changes across time. We aimed to identify normal and pathological variability that affected the foot in the recent history of West Mediterranean populations. Thus, we analyzed change in occurrence of rare variants, pathological lesions, entheseal morphology, and their probable causes. We studied 518 pairs of skeletonized feet dated from the 2nd–20th centuries CE, from Catalonia (Spain) and the region of Lazio (Italy). Moreover, a Neolithic series from Oman has been analyzed for contrast. We found that calcaneal spur, hypertrophic peroneal trochlea of calcaneus, periosteal reaction of talar neck, alteration of articular surface to lateral cuneiform, displaced talar neck to medial plane, osteophytes in cuneiform-navicular joint, fused phalanges, and forefoot eburnation showed significant differences among countries. Contrasting by countries and dates, we noticed an increase in the frequencies of these variables from Spain over the centuries. Conversely, there are no temporal differences among the Italian series. The period encompassing the 10th–19th centuries CE demonstrated the highest differences between countries. Lifestyle, occupations, footwear, and geography could be the origin of variability."
1198,4,"TITLE: A new methodology to estimate flat foot in skeletal remains – The example of mediterranean collections | KEYWORDS: Archaeological collections; Foot dimensions; Longitudinal arch; Pes planus | ABSTRACT: Flat feet (pes planus) are considered a postural defect caused by the collapse of the longitudinal arch, producing complete or near-complete contact of the sole of the foot with the ground. Pes planus has been well-studied in clinical lit-erature and paleoanthropology but has not been approached extensively in bioarchaeology. The main difficulty is related to the diagnosis of this pathology based exclusively on bone remains. In this work, we propose a metric and morphological method to discriminate flat foot in dry bones. Thus, we studied 390 pairs of adult feet in a fair state of preservation from archaeological contexts from Spain, Italy, and Oman. Morphological variability, angles, and dimensions of both the normal bones and the bones displaying flat foot characteristics were analyzed. We found a correlation between the presence of flat foot and some morphological and metric features, mainly in the subtalar and Chopart joints. These results are expressed through a combination of morphological and metric variables, which are useful to discriminate between these two groups. No markedly significant differences of flat foot frequencies between the Spanish and Italian series were found across cen-turies. However, we noticed a notable increase of the prevalence of flat foot in the contemporary collection, possibly due to the consequences of a rise in life expectancy and modern styles of footwear."
1199,0,"TITLE: Exploring the relation between reading comprehension and executive functions: Does the level of reading comprehension test matter? | KEYWORDS: Cognitive flexibility; Executive functions; Inhibition; Reading comprehension; Working memory | ABSTRACT: Background: Contemporary models for explaining reading comprehension add additional variables such as executive functions to explain students' performance. Executive functions are a set of cognitive skills that enable individuals to plan, organize, and regulate their behavior to achieve goals. The relation between executive functions and reading comprehension is not conclusive and results can partly be explained depending on the level at which reading comprehension is assessed. Aim: This study examines the magnitude of the relation between executive functions components and different levels of reading comprehension. Sample: Participants were 395 Chilean fourth grade students. Method: Executive functions were assessed through tasks of inhibition, working memory and cognitive flexibility, as well as reading comprehension at the level of words, sentences and texts. Results: Regression analysis shows that the amount of variance explained by executive functions increases with the complexity of the reading comprehension level. Comparatively, the executive components model accounts for the most variance in reading comprehension at the text level. Inhibition, working memory and flexibility share significant variance with all levels of reading comprehension. Conclusions: The results suggest that the level of complexity of the reading comprehension task used determines the effect of executive functions in explaining this relation, with inhibition and working memory being the executive component that shares the most variance across all comprehension levels tested."

This study examines the relations between executive functions components - including inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility - and reading comprehension in both narrative and expository texts. A total of 263 fourth grade elementary school students participated in this study, who were evaluated on their reading comprehension skills, as well as on their executive functions and reading variables such as word reading, fluency and vocabulary. The results of this study suggest that inhibition, working memory and cognitive flexibility have direct and indirect effects on reading comprehension of narrative and expository texts. Especially, the direct effect of working memory is highlighted, both for reading comprehension of expository and narrative texts. Additionally, academic vocabulary is an important mediating variable between executive functions, especially inhibition, and reading comprehension in students of this age. These findings underscore the relevance of strengthening executive functions to improve reading comprehension, especially in middle school students."

Several investigations have raised the effectiveness of programs aimed to the promotion of socio-emotional skills at school. The present study assessed the impact of the Aprender a SER program on a sample of 153 students aged 8 to 12 in Argentina. We compared the development of emotional problems and personal resources in a control and in an experimental group. Significant differences were observed, there being less presence of problems and greater resources in the children who received the intervention. An effect of age and sex on some of the evaluated indicators is observed. The study provides evidence to support the need to implement active learning, focused, explicit and sequenced programs to promote the development of socio-emotional skills at school from a curricular perspective.

Since the 1990s, inclusion has been considered the optimal strategy for their development. However, the effects of inclusive education on deaf and blind students are still little studied. Methods: In the present article, we report the results of a longitudinal study on the cognitive and socioemotional developmental trajectories of 23 deaf and 29 blind primary education students attending mainstream (8 deaf and 10 blind) and special schools (15 deaf and 19 blind). The study was conducted in Santiago de Chile between 2018 and 2019. Results: Our descriptive results suggest that deaf students attending special schools perform better on most of the variables studied. For blind students, those attending traditional schools generally perform better than those attending special schools. However, in the case of socio-emotional variables, blind students attending special schools tend to show fewer problems. However, almost all of the indicated differences are not statistically significantly different. Discussion: We then discuss the need to consider the characteristics of each group of students with SEN when defining an adequate educational system for their optimal development."

However, most pre-pandemic studies may have suffered from sampling selection issues, as students enrolled in online courses were often not comparable to those taking classes on campus. Similarly, most studies conducted during the initial stages of the pandemic might be confounded by the stress and anxiety associated with worldwide lockdowns and the abrupt switch to online education in most universities. Furthermore, existing studies have not comprehensively explored students' perspectives on online learning across different demographic groups, including gender, race-ethnicity, and domestic versus international student status. To address this research gap, our mixed-methods study examines these aspects using data from an anonymous survey conducted among a large and diverse sample of students at a mid-size university in the Northeastern United States. Our findings reveal important insights: (1) Females are nearly twice as likely as males to prefer online asynchronous classes and feel self-conscious about keeping their cameras on during online synchronous (e.g., Zoom) classes. However, gendered views and preferences align in other aspects of online learning. (2) Black students show a stronger preference for Zoom classes compared to online asynchronous classes and emphasize the importance of recording Zoom meetings. Hispanic students are twice as likely to prefer asynchronous online classes, which offer greater flexibility to manage multiple responsibilities. (3) International students value the ability to learn at their own pace provided by online learning but express dissatisfaction with the lack of peer interaction. On the other hand, domestic students are more concerned about reduced interaction with teachers in online education. Domestic students also exhibit a higher tendency to turn their cameras off during Zoom classes, citing reasons such as self-consciousness or privacy. These findings carry significant implications for future research and educational practice, highlighting the need for tailored approaches that consider diverse student perspectives."

This longitudinal study employed the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6–18 (CBCL) completed by the students’ guardians at least once during 2018–2019 and again during 2020. The results showed differences in internalizing and externalizing problems after 8 months of quarantine and a significant increase in students fitting clinical or borderline categories given by the CBCL itself. The results are described in detail for four groups considering the combination of SEN and SES characteristics, showing the importance of their intersectionality, especially between low SES and SEN"
1205,0,"TITLE: Developmental Trajectories of Written Language Precursors according to Socioeconomic Status | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: There is resounding evidence of the existence of direct precursors of written language, most specifically phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary, and oral comprehension. The initial differences identified in the development of written language precursors are directly related to subsequent students’ academic trajectories. Socioeconomic status is a significant source of initial differences in performance, with discrepancies in the development of reading precursors favoring children from more affluent backgrounds. We assessed reading precursors in 176 Chilean children from different socioeconomic levels. Significant differences in performance were found, which tended to favor the higher socioeconomic groups for each precursor we tested. However, the developmental trajectories of skills were similar for phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary, and oral comprehension. A compensatory trajectory was observed only in the case of rapid naming. The problem arises from the need for educational systems to adapt to the specific needs of their students, in order to generate compensatory trajectories in all reading precursor skills and enable a decrease in the gaps in reading performance among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds."
1206,0,"TITLE: The role of executive functions in the relation between socioeconomic level and the development of reading and maths skills | KEYWORDS: Cognitive development; Executive functions; Mathematics; Reading; Socioeconomic level | ABSTRACT: Executive functions (EF) are a set of processes that allow individuals to plan, monitor and organize tasks and thus play a key role in the development of reading and maths skills. Environmental factors such as socioeconomic level (SEL) influence reading and maths skills as well as EFs. The aim of this study is to explore the extent to which executive functions play a mediating role between SEL and reading and maths performance. To this end, we assessed 286 Chilean primary education students: 86 with a high SEL and 200 with a low level. The results show that the high-SEL group obtained consistently higher scores than their peers with low SEL levels in both reading and maths tasks as well as in EF measurements. This suggests that SEL could influence the development of these variables. The results also showed that EFs partially mediate the relation between SEL and reading and maths skills in primary school students through the specific function of inhibition. The results are discussed in light of the effect of SEL on the development of EFs and school learning."

However, significant challenges remain for developers, specially regarding levels of continuous involvement by children, communication aspects with young children and the incorporation of children from minorities. In the present article the results of a systematized experience for adapting three multimodal digital books for deaf and hard of hearing (D/HH) children are presented and discussed. Four phases and corresponding methods are described. Level of involvement, impact of participation in development and relations between children and adults are presented and analyzed considering how participation changes depending on the phase, activities and project progress and constrains. Results are discussed using the concepts of epistemology, values of the research team, results and stakeholders."

Defined in general based on references from other developmental nuclei, such as the coastal valleys or the high plateau, the local Formative is evaluated and discussed in light of the data obtained from three archaeological locations: Pampa El Muerto, Pampa Oxaya and Mullipungo. We suggest the continuity of mobile groups with a hunting-gathering way of life, who would have progressively incorporated ceramics and the management of animal resources, as evidenced by rock art. Consequently, the existence of a particular local historical trajectory during the Formative times is proposed for the Precordillera of Arica, in the South-Central Andes."

Other archaeological records have been mentioned occasionally and anecdotally. Investigations carried out from 2006 onwards in the highlands of this region, have sought to address other social dynamics of these hunter-gatherer groups beyond their subsistence, in order to discuss other aspects of their mobility. In this exploratory investigation, we focus on the chronological and contextual systematization of archaic ornamental and sumptuary objects, of local or allochthonous provenance, in the Precordillera (foothills) of northern Chile (2,800-3,800 masl). The presence of these objects, usually classified as ""miscellaneous"", found in ten sites with archaic occupations, allows us to account for the different mobility patterns of the highland Andean groups and their possible interaction with other specialized groups. They also allow us to discuss their role and importance in the shaping of different interaction and differentiation forms between individuals inside highland groups. Finally, we discuss the configuration and maintenance of social interactions materialized by the circulation of miscellaneous objects, and the necessary flow of information in the social dynamics established between the Archaic and Formative periods in the Central-South Andes region."

Relaciones entre Pensamiento Histórico y Educación Ciudadana en el Currículum Chileno (1990-2023) | KEYWORDS: Chile; Citizenship education; Curriculum; Historical thinking; Second order concepts | ABSTRACT: In Chile, over the past decades, historians and educators have expressed critical views regarding attempts to reduce school hours dedicated to the subject of History, Geography, and Social Sciences. One of their main arguments is that this impacts the citizenship education provided to students by their schools. However, this effect cannot be taken for granted solely because this subject exists; it must be examined how it is produced by the various components of the teaching-learning processes involved, including the curriculum. This article analyzes how the Chilean curriculum has constructed the relationship between history teaching and citizenship education since the return to democracy. Through a historical and qualitative analysis of the content of curriculum documents from the period, it is argued that, since the 1990s, the Chilean curriculum has progressively incorporated the development of historical thinking as a specific purpose of the subject of History, Geography, and Social Sciences. At the same time, there has been a shift from a civic education aimed at providing theoretical knowledge about the State to a citizenship education that seeks to promote skills and attitudes for life in society. However, the incorporation of historical thinking has been uneven, excessively prioritizing some of its dimensions over others or presenting the former in an ambiguous manner. This raises questions about the extent to which this new approach to historical education contributes to the new objectives of citizenship education."

Based on fieldwork conducted in 2014 in a Chilean public high school, I use discourse analysis to examine students’ interviews as a particular kind of social work. In these interviews, I argue that students were displaying and participating in the constant production of coherent frameworks in which history and politics are connected. Students’ under-standings of history and politics inform and affect each other, as well as become significant in their citizenship education."

This study attempts to understand how an educational innovation opens up new spaces of identity configuration within a school and how students and teachers produce meanings by participating in it. To do so, we present a case study from the Interdisciplinary School Research Program about a school named Sagrados Corazones de Manquehue, based on semi-structured interviews with the actors involved in this project and an analytic approach drawing from grounded theory. Our findings show that innovation can configure a space in which new identities are produced through emergent discourses, practices, and external acknowledgement. At the same time, this new space impacts both the students' self-knowledge and the teachers' professional development, and furthers a strong sense of community among the members of the program. However, it also implies a constant risk of reproducing some of the excluding dynamics of the school."

Using ethnographic data and interviews with high school students, it proposes to understand this process in the context of a figured world directly linked with youth activism and student contentious politics: that of ‘Student Democracy’. The article argues that this figured world is constantly being produced by students, teachers and parents engaging in contentious local practices and that, in doing so, they create new opportunities for political action and citizenship education within school settings. It also argues that, by engaging with this figured world, students are participating in both ‘Student Democracy’ and the broader societal democracy, learning to be citizens in the present, and to deal with the possibilities, risks, and responsibilities that democratic participation always entails."
1216,0,"TITLE: When kind of citizen? Temporally displaced citizenship education in a Chilean private school | KEYWORDS: Citizenship education; elite education; privilege; service learning; social change; temporal displacement | ABSTRACT: In Chile, some elite private schools have developed a particular approach towards citizenship education, acknowledging the privileged social position their students occupy, while inviting them to disrupt the same social structure that has produced this privilege. However, the enduring salience of Chilean society's inequalities begs the question of how effective this approach truly is. This paper attempts to answer this, examining a Chilean private school and a particular service-learning activity. Through ethnographic methods and an analysis rooted in cultural production theory, the paper argues that, although many of its components are still quite problematic, service-learning activities like this one do provide opportunities for promoting participatory and social justice citizenship education, through the students' engagement in “collective deliberations.” However, these opportunities are neutralized when framed within a particular cultural fact–here called the Discourse of the Leaders–which displaces the enactment of students' citizenship into a future that still does not exist. The article provides a more nuanced understanding of the different ways inequitable social structures of privilege are dealt with in elite educational institutions that explicitly purport to challenge them. It also offers new avenues for educators to contribute to citizenship education practices that can more effectively promote social change."

Through this ethnographic study, which draws on 36 interviews, community walkabouts, and participant observations in community-led adult education classes, we show how Dominican mothers struggle with conflicting values; on the one hand, they embrace the idea of schooling for individual advancement, integration in the US, and critical thinking, while on the other hand, they regret the diminution of a collective, family orientation and respect for parents. Overall, this study shows that contradictions are not a sign of confusion or denial, but rather a struggle to transform cultural practices that satisfy multiple worlds. A deeper understanding of these contradictions could help educators and educational institutions consider how these transnational tensions motivate parent engagement and their hopes for their children’s education."

The most important tool was reading. This article attempts to shed light on the teaching and learning processes of reading in Chilean public schools between the 1840s and the 1920s, through the analysis of the two main textbooks used for this purpose: The Gradual Reading Method of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (1845) and The New Method (phonetic, analytic and synthetic) for the simultaneous teaching of reading and writing by Claudio Matte (1884). Two clearly distinct sets of educational ideas and school practices hinged upon each primer, the shift from one to the other reflecting changes in the very conception of the value of the ability to read and the way in which schools should foster its acquisition."

Hence, people's food choices also contribute for the definition of the extension of this impact and therefore this work aimed at studying some motivations that influence people's eating habits. This was an observational, cross-sectional study, undertaken on a non-probabilistic sample of 11960 participants form 16 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Croatia, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, Romania, United States of America). The survey was undertaken by means of a questionnaire of self-response, applied only to adult citizens. The results obtained indicated that a great number of participants admit to shape their food choices according to some environmental concerns, like, for example, they prefer foods from the season or those that comply with sustainable processing and packaging. Regarding the food surplus, this seems a priority to avoid at home, but not so much when it comes to restaurants. Factor analysis indicated two types of concerns: Purely Environmental Concerns (PEC) and Sustainability allied to Quality Concerns (SQC), and cluster analysis showed that 54% of the participants tend to make their food choices considering both types of concerns, which is very expressive and positive towards sustainability of the food chain."

In particular, I investigate the transition from primary to secondary school and to higher education, comparing enrollment in academic and vocational tracks at the secondary and tertiary levels. With a series of logistic regressions, I study differences in these critical educational transitions associated with indigenous status, together with gender and location. Analyses of the 2012 seventh-grade cohort show that indigenous status increases the likelihood of enrolling in vocational high schools, but regarding the transition to higher education, indigenous status is only relevant when school SES is not included. Nevertheless, vocational high school graduates (where indigenous students concentrate) are less likely to enroll in higher education, and more likely to enroll in vocational instead of academic higher education programs. Overall, indigenous status has a clear impact on students' transition from middle school to high school, which has relevant consequences for the transition to higher education."

On the other hand, the study includes the perspective of Universidad de Tarapacá’s academics, who prepare teachers in charge of implementing citizenship education. Based on the analysis of information collected by teacher and academic questionnaires, this article points out that most teachers indicate a lack of specialized training in citizenship education. Moreover, most academics do not produce research on this topic. This implies varying ways of understanding citizenship education, which, in practice, impacts the way in which citizenship education is taught in schools. This article concludes by providing a series of recommendations for improving initial teacher training, with the aim of advancing citizenship education in schools, according to the guidelines of the Ministry of Education of Chile."

Gender, National Contexts, and Math Performance in Latin America | KEYWORDS: gender; Latin America; STEM education | ABSTRACT: Studies of gender disparities in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) performance have generally focused on average differences. However, the extremes could also be important because disparities at the top may shape stratification in access to STEM careers, while disparities at the bottom can shape stratification in dropout. This article investigates determinants of gender disparities in math across the performance distribution in Latin American countries, where there is a persistent boys’ advantage in STEM performance. Findings reveal disparate national patterns in gender gaps across the performance distribution. Furthermore, while certain national characteristics are linked to gender gaps at the low- and middle-ranges of the performance distribution, female representation in education is the only characteristic associated with a reduced gender gap at the top level."

Based on interviews with teachers and professionals of public and rural schools in Arica, this article reflects on how aymara children, both chilean-born and immigrant, are perceived by their educators. Results suggest that, although favorable at first sight, perceptions include distinctions and preferences based on ethnicity, nationality, and territory that may crystalize differences among groups, impacting the life and educational trajectories of children."
1224,0,"TITLE: Evolving approaches to the study of childhood poverty and education | KEYWORDS: Child poverty; deprivation; education surveys; socio-economic status | ABSTRACT: Social scientists have conceptualised poverty in multiple ways, with measurement approaches that seek to identify absolute, relative, subjective, and multi-dimensional poverty. The concept of poverty is central in the comparative education field, but has been empirically elusive in many large, international educational surveys: these studies have not typically included measures that correspond to prevalent conceptualisations or measurement strategies in the poverty literature. In this paper, we contrast poverty conceptualisation and measurement in the poverty literature with socio-economic measures prominent in major international educational surveys. Disconnects between these approaches, and implications for understanding how the disadvantages of poverty in childhood are reflected in educational surveys, are considered. We discuss key challenges that continue to shape possibilities for incorporation of poverty-related concepts into educational surveys. We close with a set of recommendations and considerations."
1225,3,"TITLE: Barriers towards enhancing mobility through integrated mobility services in a regional and rural context: insights from suppliers and organisers | KEYWORDS: In-depth stakeholder interviews; Mobility-as-a-Service; Rural MaaS; Transport/non-transport service providers | ABSTRACT: This study explores the potential for integrated mobility services in a regional and rural context. In-depth interviews of stakeholders, including Non-Transport Providers and Transport Providers, were conducted in three regional locations in New South Wales, Australia. Findings revealed that the majority had a positive attitude towards integrated mobility services which could potentially form features of the mobility framework that are relevant to a future provision of Regional and Rural Mobility as a Service (MaaS). Those who expressed negative attitudes commonly had concerns about subscription fees, the reality of private car dependence in rural areas, and the digital usage by older people. The paper discusses the government's role in improving travel options which ensure equitable access to both local and regional transport services. Policy implications for necessary adjustments to the modal landscape as part of a MaaS offering, including the technology implications, are drawn. The results provide insights into the features of mobility services provided by various stakeholders and their fit within the mobility framework."
1226,3,"TITLE: Workshop 7a report: Sustainable transport systems designed to meet the needs of both users and residents | KEYWORDS: Infrastructure; Spatial planning; Sustainable transport; Transport justice; User-centric mobility | ABSTRACT: There is a fundamental tension between user convenience and system efficiency in transport. This workshop set out to bridge the discussions on user-centric mobility with those on transport justice and sustainable transport. Based on eleven papers offering insights into public transport user groups and preferences, post-pandemic mobility behaviours, transport infrastructure planning and reform, and transport governance collaboration and capacity from transport systems across six continents, the workshop underscored that users are not all the same and that new travel patterns are emerging. It also highlighted the challenges of infrastructure reform and multi-level transport governance. To design sustainable and just transport systems that efficiently deliver value to a diverse range of users and residents, the workshop recommends that policymakers increase flexibility; think, plan, and assess across domains; and involve a broader set of stakeholders than currently engaged. Research should bridge the theory-practice gap, rethink system designs, and explore land-transport interactions. To build upon the discussions from this workshop, the next Thredbo conference should host a session focused on the successes and failures in implementing sustainable transport policies, with particular emphasis on the involvement of, and impact on, underrepresented groups, communities, and silent majorities."

The trips to and from university campuses are made by staff, students, and visitors, with an important daily rotation of people (e.g., students who leave early, arrive later, etc.). In this study, we aim to improve our understanding of the trips made to the University of Sydney campuses, one of the largest universities in Australia, through investigation of how individuals (namely, staff and students) choose to study/work from home and their modes of transport used to go to campus on different days of the week. We have collected three sets of data: one in 2022 and two in 2023, using a survey answered by both staff and students. A hybrid logit model including latent variables is estimated to understand the motivations and main drivers to work/study from home and to choose different modes of transport when attending campus. The results indicate that while travel times and costs/fare are important, they are not the primary factors influencing travel behaviour and mode choices. One key factor was whether staff and students worked or studied from home and campus on the same day, with these individuals more likely to use active transport modes, which is also associated with living closer to campus. Students living farther from campus tend to attend more frequently and primarily use public transport. Social connections and a preference for in-person activities are significant motivations that drive different weekly mobility decisions."

The ‘New Normal’ seems to be one that is best associated with living with COVID-19 rather that ‘after COVID-19’. After a year or more since the pandemic spread throughout the world, we have amassed a significant amount of evidence on what this is likely to mean for patterns of commuting activity in a setting where working for home (WFH) is becoming a more popular and legitimate alternative to choosing a commuting mode. With WFH continuing to some extent, non-commuting travel is also likely to change as workers and their families have greater flexibility in when and to what extent they conduct their shopping, social-recreation and other non-commuting trip activity. This paper recognises that all trip purpose activity is being impacted by the pandemic and that the drivers of changing number of trips by each and every trip purpose need to be identified as a way of establishing likely future levels of frequency of all trip making. In this paper we develop a series of trip making models for workers and non-workers in New South Wales and Queensland in a metropolitan and a regional setting, using data collected in late 2020. The influence of the number of days WFH is identified as an important influence on the number of one-way weekly trips for various trip purposes, which together with socioeconomic, geographic and attitudinal variables enable us to gain an understanding of what is driving levels of trip-purpose-specific travel during the pandemic. Elasticities and simulated changes are presented as a behaviourally rich way to understand the sensitivity of influences on the frequency of travel."

With growing support and preference revelation from both employees and employers, we might anticipate a settling in of working from home around one to two days a week, varying by occupation depending on the ability to work remotely. Although there are a growing number of studies that have analysed data collected at a point in time or over time during the pandemic, there is now sufficient time and data to treat the waves of collected data as a repeated cross section that is jointly modelled to assess systematically, the changing roles of various influences on the proportion of working days that are worked from home. This paper estimates random effects regression models for the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area and South-East Queensland over four waves of data collected in 2020 and 2021, where this last one represents a period with almost full vaccinations and minimum restrictions (i.e., ‘new normal’). By jointly estimating four waves of data within a single modelling framework, we are able to track the changing roles of the influences found to be statistically significant across the waves. The elasticity outputs reveal how these influences impact on the propensity to WFH, giving clues on whether we were starting to see a stabilisation of WFH activity mid-way in the pandemic period that can be reflective of a ‘new normal’. Results are very supportive of employees’ preferences, suggesting that those that feel the same or more productive when working from home relative to going to the office, are more likely to working from home relative to those that feel less productive."

In this paper, we explore preferences for and attitudes towards WFH in great detail, leveraging two waves of data to explore the remarkable and globally unique situation of three metro areas (Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area, South-East Queensland, and Melbourne) who despite entering lockdown at the same time in 2021, follow significantly different trajectories with respect to the severity and duration of the lockdowns. We find that irrespective of the degree of severity of the lockdown and the duration thereof, employee preferences for working from home, and importantly productivity, remained unchanged. Rather than diminishing the desire to WFH, evidence indicates that as periods of lockdown extend the desire to continue WFH only seems to intensify. While all workers express a preference to continue WFH in an unrestricted world, more often than they did prior to the pandemic, we further identify three broad segments of workers based primarily on how much of a balance they can strike between the benefits and challenges of WFH, which dictates how often they would like to WFH. Given that the desire to WFH more and the positive externalities of increased WFH, we argue that measures to support ongoing WFH are important to sustainable cities and the people who live in them, across several dimensions."
1233,3,"TITLE: Workshop 6 report: Micromobility movement in urban transport | KEYWORDS: Bicycle sharing; E-scooters; Micromobility; Pricing; Public transport systems; Regulation; Transport policy; Urban transport | ABSTRACT: The theme of micromobility was introduced for the first time in Thredbo 17 as the growth of shared and privately-owned e-scooters, bicycles and e-bicycles continue to affect the nature and structure of urban transport systems worldwide. And whilst in some cases they challenge the priority afforded to the private car, in others they complement already existing and well-established greener transport modes such as cycling and walking. The discussion in this workshop focused on a number of questions looking at the benefits of micromobility and discussing the main incentives for their use as an urban mode of transport, questioning the role of government and describing the potential threats, if any, to public transport systems, in what we expect for the future of micromobility. Five papers showcased evidence on the use of micromobility, from e-scooters in Norway and Australia, to public bicycles in South Korea and The Netherlands. Each of the questions discussed in the workshop is reported in this paper. The need for multimodal integration is evident and remains essential to ensure complementarity across transport in cities. However, other concerns such as the need for regulation, education/enforcement structures, stronger business models and more effective tendering procedures have been identified and discussed. A long list of future research topics in the area of micromobility is provided and some themes for Thredbo 18 are recommended."
1234,3,"TITLE: A comparative analysis of University Sustainable Travel Plans – Experience from Australia | KEYWORDS: Education precinct TDM; Sustainable travel choices; Sustainable travel plans; Travel demand management | ABSTRACT: Travel Demand Management (TDM) initiatives are widely applied by transport planners to establish and enable appropriate use of critical transport infrastructure. Less attention has been given to the specific case of TDM in an education precinct (university) context. Travel Plans have been promoted as a means for an organisation to encourage sustainable travel choices by their employees, visitors and customers. This paper offers an empirical contribution to the literature through a comparative qualitative evaluation of selected University Sustainable Travel Plans (USTPs) in Australia to identify the most important questions that a USTP should address explicitly. The evaluation comprised identification of a set of evaluation questions, completion of a template for each USTP considered and application of a simple scoring exercise. We also identify TDM measures that have been introduced as part of a USTP in response to the typical travel patterns exhibited in university settings. A contribution of this paper is to create a means of comparison of USTPs and to establish the components of a comprehensive travel plan."

While it may be some time until we are able to indicate, with some confidence, the impact that WFH will have on traffic congestion and crowding on public transport, there is a sense already that it is a game changer, and indeed is one of the most effective policy levers that the transport sector has had for many years in ‘managing’ the performance of the transport network. This paper draws on multiple ways of survey data that have been collected since March 2020 when the pandemic first resulted in severe restrictions in Australia. We present the evidence up to December 2021 on the incidence of WFH in two geographical jurisdiction – the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area (GSMA) and South-East Queensland (SEQ) - and how it has been received by employees and employers from the height of restrictions up to a period when restrictions were relaxed, followed by further lockdowns throughout Australia. We show what this might mean for work productivity, lifestyle, and the changing preferences for passenger modes. With a growing preference, within some occupation classes, to WFH 1–2 days a week, and a good spread through the weekdays, we discuss what this means for the way we analyse the impact of transport initiatives on the performance of the transport network with a particular emphasis on the growth in suburbanisation of transport improvements, less costly service and infrastructure improvements, and the changing role of public transport."
1236,5,"TITLE: REDUCING CONGESTION AND CROWDING WITH WORKING FROM HOME | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; crowding on public transport; positive benefits of WFH; road congestion; societal impacts; working from home | ABSTRACT: COVID-19 has changed the landscape within which we travel. Working from Home (WFH) in many countries has increased significantly, and while it was often forced on a society it has delivered some unintended positive consequences associated in particular with the levels of congestion on the roads and crowding on public transport. With a likelihood of some amount of WFH continuing as we move out of the active COVID-19 period, the question being asked is whether the post-COVID-19 period will return the pre-COVID-19 levels of traffic congestion and crowding. In many jurisdictions, there is a desire to avoid this circumstance and to use WFH as a policy lever that has appeal to employees, employers and government planning agencies in order to find ways of better managing future levels of congestion and crowding. This chapter uses the ongoing research and surveys we have been undertaking in Australia since March 2020 to track behavioural responses that impact on commuting and non-commuting travel, and to examine what the evidence tells us about opportunities into the future in many geographical settings to better manage congestion and crowding. This is linked to a desire by employers to maintain WFH where it makes sense as a way of not only supporting sustainability charters but also the growing interest in a commitment to a broader social licence. We discuss ways in which WFH can contribute to flattening peaks in travel; but also the plans that some public transport authorities are putting in place to ensure that crowding on public transport is mitigated as people increasingly return to using public transport. Whereas we might have thought that we now have plenty of public transport capacity, this may not be the case if we want to control crowding, and more capacity may be needed which could be a challenge for trains more than buses given track capacity limits. We conclude the chapter by summarising some of the positive benefits associated with WFH, and the implications not just for transport but for society more widely."

The reduction in the amount of commuting time has resulted in time released for other activities. In this paper we identify the incidence of released time to paid work, unpaid work, and leisure, and investigate the key drivers of this allocation. The findings are important in obtaining estimated time benefits from reduced commuting activity with such travel time being traded against work and leisure, and what this might mean for the future travel, activity location, and lifestyle landscape."

The paper found that the overall statistical performance of the mixed logit model improved significantly, suggesting that this conditioning idea has merit. Experience was treated as an exogenous influence linked to the scale of the random component, and to that extent it captures some amount of the heterogeneity in unobserved effects, purging them of potential endogeneity. The current paper continues to investigate the matter of endogeneity versus exogeneity. The proposed approach implements the control function method through the experience conditioning feature in a choice model. We develop two choice models, both using stated preference data. The paper extends the received contribution in that we allow for the endogenous variable to have an impact on the attributes through a two stage method, called the Multiple Indicator Solution, originally implemented in a different context and for a single (quality) attribute, in which stage two is the popular control function method. In the first stage, the entire utility expression associated with all observed attributes is conditioned on the prior experience with an alternative. Hence, we are capturing possible correlates associated with each and every attribute and not just one selected attribute. We find evidence of potential endogeneity. The purging exercise however, results in both statistical similarities and differences in time and cost choice elasticities and mean estimates of the value of travel time savings. We are able to identify a very practical method to correct for possible endogeneity under experience conditioning that will encourage researchers and practitioners to use such an approach in more advanced non-linear discrete choice models as a matter of routine."

A key feature of the COVID-19 era is likely to be a rethink of the way we work and the implications on commuting activity. Working from home (WFH) has been the ‘new normal’ during the period of lockdown, except for essential services that require commuting. In recognition of the new normal as represented by an increasing amount of WFH, this paper develops a model to identify the incidence of WFH and what impact this could have on the number of weekly commuting trips. Using data collected in eight countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and South Africa), we developed a Poisson regression model for the number of days individuals worked from home during the pandemic. Simulated scenarios quantify the impact of the different variables on the probability of WFH by country. The findings provide a reference point as we continue to undertake similar analysis at different points through time during the pandemic and after when restrictions are effectively removed."
1240,3,"TITLE: Understanding business location decision making for transport planning: An investigation of the role of process rules in identifying influences on firm location | KEYWORDS: Attribute non-attendance; Business location decisions; Discrete choice models; Location decision drivers; Stated choice experiment | ABSTRACT: Decisions made by businesses on where to locate or relocate are typically given less consideration in integrated transport and land use modelling systems than residential location. This is surprising given the important role that businesses play in defining employment opportunities, and hence the travel patterns of workers and any travel associated with accessing firms. This paper studies business location decisions in the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area (GSMA) through two types of models. The first one, referred to as an attribute-non-attendance (ANA) model, is used to identify the influences on location decisions that are attended to and those that are typically ignored. The second model is a mixed multinomial logit model with ANA to capture differences in preferences as a way of investigating the key drivers of business location. The findings suggest that the main drivers vary across the GSMA, making specific locations an important determinant of choice, with businesses located in Sydney being especially concerned about access to public transport and the distance of other locations to the current location; businesses located in Wollongong placing great importance on client accessibility; and businesses located in Newcastle being very sensitive to the distance to their current location. Simulated scenarios are presented in this study to illustrate the degree of behavioural responsiveness to changes in important attributes such as accessibility, location and office characteristics."

As of late May 2020, three months after COVID-19 resulted in restrictions in Australia, we saw an annual travel time reduction for car and public transport commuters in the GSMA of $5.58 billion, representing a 54.02% reduction in the Pre-COVID-19 total time costs, much of which we would suggest can be associated with reductions in congestions costs. Adjusting further for reduced employment volumes relative to pre-COVID-19 levels, to take into account reduced commuting activity due, in part, to a lower volume of work associated with a loss of employment or lower employment hours, the annual time cost reduction for all commuters who still have regular pre-COVID-19 levels of employment are estimated as $4.4 billion. Hence there is $1.17 billion worth of reduced time costs associated with significantly reduced employment hours, including a loss of employment. The implications for road investment linked to congestion in particular is profound, and shows how much of an increase in benefit to society, through congestion busting, can be obtained by more flexible work arrangements, even allowing for some switching into car out of public transport. Whether the current decrease in travel costs will be long-lasting is unknown, but it does support the appeal of working from home, if it is sustainable, as a policy lever to reduce levels of congestion on the roads and crowding in public transport."

An informative input into the infrastructure selection process should be the preferences of residents, since they can guide buy into support political and bureaucratic choice making. Cost–benefit analysis (CBA) uses the self-interest preferences of individuals as the relevant interpretation of ‘individual preferences count’, which in aggregate represent the benefit to society of candidate investments. However, the CBA benefit calculations can be rather restrictive with other preference metrics often being identified and used in various ways to inform the debate on infrastructure support. In this paper we assess how the preferences for bus rapid transit (BRT) and light rail transit (LRT) change with different roles the residents may play: a citizen or altruistic resident, a self-interested resident, a tax-payer, and as a voter. We use data collected in five countries to investigate preference differences and also to establish whether there is replicability of the findings across geographical jurisdictions. The findings suggest that there are, in general, noticeable differences in preference revelation across the metrics; however there are also both similarities and differences in the role of specific attribute drivers (as represented by willingness to pay, and magnitude of support for a specific mode) within and between preference metrics across countries."

This is surprising given the important role that businesses play in defining employment opportunities, and hence the travel patterns of workers and any travel associated with accessing firms. As part of a larger study on giving firm location choices an endogenous representation in an integrated model system, this paper reviews the existing literature on the drivers of location and relocation decisions in various geographical jurisdictions. The findings provide a starting position in the design of future firm-specific surveys, and especially the attributes that are candidates for stated choice experiments and for inclusion in firm location utility equations embedded in integrated strategic model systems."

1246,3,"TITLE: Information for travelling: Awareness and usage of the various sources of information available to public transport users in NSW | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Public transport authorities and service providers place great emphasis on information provision to travellers both before and during travel. Information provided prior to travel has included printed timetables, newspaper advertisements, telephone services and marketing campaigns. During the trip, providers have tended to offer maps at public transport stops (i.e. bus stops, train stations, ferry wharves, etc.) as well as timetables static, dynamic or real-time. Some of these channels are still used but improvements in digital technology has led to a wider range of information distributed using different digital media. Whilst Transport for NSW and transport operators continue to provide the more traditional information, there has been a plethora of third party applications which are accessible on the move. The literature recognises that the need for information and the importance of information provision differs at the various stages of the trip, from planning, to entry into the system, to wayfinding during the trip and egress from the system. However, no systematic research exists as to how information preferences and usage differ between customer segments. It is important for operators and regulators to identify the segments and their information preferences so as to promote public transport use. This paper addresses this important issue by presenting the results of an internet survey of the public’s awareness and usage of public transport information. The paper looks at awareness and usage of information sources and how this varies by stage of journey and frequency of usage of public transport. Factor analysis is used to identify segments of customers by attitudes towards public transport and usage of information sources. These results are used to model how these factors relate to overall satisfaction with public transport journeys. The paper provides a reference for other states in Australia as to the value of different types of information."

This strategy was implemented in an elective ethics course within a higher education setting. To evaluate the experience, we conducted a pilot case study using two qualitative analysis instruments: an individual survey and a focus group to capture students' perspectives. The qualitative analysis identified three key themes: (1) Pedagogical Design; (2) Application of Ethics to Real-Life Contexts; and (3) Openness to Dialogue. The findings suggest that the proposed strategy could serve as an effective pedagogical tool for incorporating applied ethics into the higher education curriculum, especially in interdisciplinary contexts. Additionally, the results indicate that further research should focus on specific disciplinary contexts and emphasize the need to improve feedback practices during the development of the deliberative activity. This improvement could be achieved by adopting an assessment-for-learning approach, allowing for ongoing feedback throughout the learning process."

The aim of this work is to study how technology can scaffold peer assessment activities to develop critical thinking among pre-service teachers and study the relevance of giving and receiving feedback. A series of practice and application activities were introduced using technology-scaffolded peer assessment. Technological scaffolding minimized classroom logistics, while at the same time resolved any personal issues between peers as the tasks were assigned at random. Mixed-methods analysis revealed that technology-scaffolded peer assessment with anonymous feedback aided the significant development of critical thinking activities. It also showed that the feedback that was given was a predictor of the success of these activities. The added value of this work is that we show that for pre-service teachers, in a Reading Methods course, we can improve critical thinking skills with technology scaffolded peer assessment, and that giving feedback shows to be more relevant than receiving it."

There has been a rush towards online learning by education systems during COVID-19; this can therefore be seen as an opportunity to develop students’ higher-order thinking skills. In this short report we show how critical thinking and creativity can be developed in an online context, as well as highlighting the importance of grit. We also suggest the importance of heuristic evaluation in the design of online systems to support twenty-first century learning."

Formative assessment represents a set of student-centered practices, the results of which are not always optimal. Furthermore, different technologies are better suited to certain tasks than to others. The study follows a Design-Based Research approach and was conducted in Chile in two phases. In the first phase of the study, a formative assessment strategy for teaching spelling is developed. In a subsequent phase, the impact of different technologies on this strategy is analyzed. This is achieved by comparing two different technologies: Tablet PCs and the interpersonal computer. The results reveal that a self-paced formative assessment strategy using Tablets is more effective than the same strategy using an interpersonal computer when teaching spelling to primary school students. This therefore highlights the impact of technology on learning when adopting a formative assessment strategy."

Teresa de Alexandre Dumas, versión de Andrés Bello (1839), o un ensayo parcial de genética teatral a partir de una traducción. | KEYWORDS: Alexandre Dumas; Andrés Bello; Teresa; Theatre Genetics; Theatre Translation | ABSTRACT: This article aims to study Andrés Bello’s translation of Alexandre Dumas’ play Teresa (1832) to tentatively reconstruct part of nineteenth-century Chile’s dramaturgical and theatrical universe. Based mainly on methodologies of theatrical genetics (Grésillon, Thomasseau, Féral) and on a comparison of the translation with its original, and starting from the premise that Bello’s text is an arrangement of the original, with substantial modifications both at dramaturgical and microtextual level, the essay aims to understand the artistic, political and social reasons behind these changes, within its context and, ultimately, to try to fill a historiographical gap around the theatrical practices of the nineteenth century in Chile."
1252,9,"TITLE: “We can’t demand anything:” Migrants’ practices of accommodation and urban incorporation in an autoconstructed settlement in Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: accommodation; autoconstruction; Chile; Citizenship; migration; urban incorporation | ABSTRACT: Migrant populations globally are often subjected to explicit forms of housing discrimination based on their race, nationality, migration status, and social class. In Chile, due to the dramatic increase in rent prices and a worsening housing crisis, migrants have turned to autoconstructing their own houses in campamentos (squatter settlements) in recent years. Drawing on 13 months of ethnographic fieldwork, we show that the campamentos autoconstructed by immigrants have turned into new spaces of sociality, inclusion, and the emergence of new forms of citizenship. Unlike most of the anthropological literature on autoconstruction processes, we do not focus on how the symbolic and material production of the city frame poor people's involvement in social movements for housing. Rather, we show how, by self-building their houses and neighborhoods, immigrants produce a specific form of political subjectivity based on an ethics of civility and individual accommodation. Furthermore, we highlight the paradoxes that emerge between, on the one hand, their discursive emphasis on individual strategies to achieve legitimate citizenship and urban social inclusion and, on the other hand, their actual participation in collective life in the settlement, as well as a sense of shared norms and common morality. In doing so, we argue that this tension emerges from the need to defend their right to urban social inclusion as inhabitants who see themselves as embodying and enacting stigmatized forms of city-making and urban incorporation."

It analyses the relationship between pursuit of personal fulfilment and concern for parental well-being among Peruvian migrants in Switzerland whose parents remain in Peru. Based on in-depth interviews, we analyse the importance assigned to personal goals, the resignification of filial obligations, and how migrants reconcile the desire to be a ‘good’ son or daughter with the desire for self-fulfilment. This process, strongly shaped by gender and social class, involves the negotiation of distinct principles of autonomy and filial obligation prevailing in the country of origin and destination. Turning our attention to less explored emotions, such as pride and a sense of fulfilment, we show how to deal with principles that may be in tension, migrant children construe the pursuit of self-fulfilment and the desire to accomplish family responsibilities as interdependent dynamics in the context of filial transnational caregiving."

The findings highlight that decision-making is affected by power relations, where gender and economic resources play a decisive role. Sibling negotiations are also related to the capacity to fulfil the filial duty of taking care and feeling recognized as the son or daughter who takes care of the parents, just as the parents did when the siblings were children. While the sample covers a group of migrants settled in Switzerland who achieved important levels of social, cultural, and labor integration, the results provide insights on transnational care issues that are applicable to other South-North migration contexts."

Based on interviews conducted mainly with older mothers, it analyses the articulation between care received locally and at long distance, the practices they provide to care for family members, and their self-care activities to support themselves in an «independent» old age. The findings confirm the central role of families and, particularly of women, in ensuring a welfare regime for the older adult population and mitigate the effects of social unprotection."

Accounts of migrants’ public lives have turned to underlining mundane forms of conviviality and place-making. Th is visual essay shows how such dynamics can comprise a fertile terrain for public engagement in contexts of “crisis.” Th e account is based on a photovoice exercise developed by three long-established migrant women of diff erent occupations, age, and nationalities during the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis that shaped the personal/public interface of their lives. I propose that photovoice, by endowing agency and producing situated knowledge, can illuminate migrants’ local engagement, making visible (creatively, descriptively, and symbolically) the connection between the personal and the public while counteracting dominant problem-based representations of migrants."

In total, 311 news from three digital news outlets were analyzed, which differed in their editorial frames and were among the most visited in Chile: El Mostrador, Cooperativa and EMOL. A mixed study (quantitative and qualitative) was carried out, through a lexicometric analysis, which allows analyzing large corpus of data. The findings indicate the existence of six vocabulary classes (clusters), which illustrate different ways in which the migratory phenomenon was represented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our main results are discussed regarding the content in each clustter and linked to previous national and international studies. Beyond the pandemic, the findings invite to expand our understanding of migration representation in contexts of crisis."

For this purpose, a search, review and systematisation of the international literature (books and articles) and journals on migration, gender and family studies has been carried out. We propose that two analytical points of focus converge in this discussion. The first is derived from studies on transnational migrant families and the second from studies on care. Through a review of the literature, we have identified the main contributions that each of these points of focus makes to the analysis of care for the elderly in contexts of transnational migration, and we also review some of the missing data and blind spots in order to elaborate on emerging research agendas in this area."

Through processes of social production and construction of space, it explores the material, societal and symbolic processes at play. The entry points are memories, images, uses and material connection to Patronato neighbourhood (Santiago, Chile) by people of Korean and Palestinian ancestry. It analyses how claims of space authenticity, processes of ethnicisation and material appropriation of space–commonly understood as given by ‘cultural differences’–respond to historical, economic and political shifts happening at a global and local level. Moreover, challenging the prism of socioeconomic conflict and separation, it shows emerging dynamics of social interdependence and adjustment, taking place alongside the reorganisation of ethnic boundaries. Such reorganisation allows settled migrants to develop a sense of belonging and control over space in a rapidly changing neoliberal city."

Host countries’ pre-existing social dynamics and environmental conditions mutually shape everyday interactions between people from different ethnonational backgrounds within specific spaces. This article examines two kinds of community-making practices consisting of both intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic exchanges and collaborations, under conditions of shared insecurity in a multicultural commercial neighbourhood in Santiago, Chile. Drawing on ethnic Chinese experiences and responses to crime, we discuss how inhabitants of multicultural sites create more hospitable spaces by building and overcoming boundaries with co-ethnics, other migrants and ‘locals’. Our ethnographic study finds that Chinese residents engaged in what we term ‘strategic ethnic groupism’, which aims to prompt the solidarity of an ‘ethnic-based’ collective in order to politically organise towards long-term solutions. Yet, simultaneously, with other migrants and citizens, the Chinese negotiated everyday intercultural conviviality through creating relations of trust and care to address more immediate insecurity concerns. Discussing both strategies, this article contributes to understanding the productive frictions between ethnicity, community and belonging, under shared conditions of insecurity, in multicultural urban spaces."

This article takes a different approach by attending to the possible reciprocity in labour relations– despite unequal power dynamics– particularly when workplaces are small and involve daily interactions between migrant workers and migrant employers. Methodology is based on observations in Chinese-run retail shops and restaurants in Santiago, and interviews with Chinese employers and their Latin American migrant employees of diverse backgrounds. Proposing the concept of “precarious labour relations”, we examine the independent and shared uncertainties between migrant employers and workers who are differently marginalized through race/migrant status axes in Chile. Analyzing dynamics of hierarchy, (mis)trust, and reciprocity in how these actors negotiate precarity and security as workers and/or migrants, we complicate dichotomies of exploitation and resistance in migrant labour research, by foregrounding the multidimensional relationship between employers and workers when both are racialized migrants and minorities."

Focusing on 93-octane gasoline in Greater Santiago, Chile, we analyse data from 371 gas stations collected over 164 days, taking into account both the types and locations of these stations. Our findings reveal significant price discrepancies within localised areas and competitive practices among stations operating within a 1.5-kilometre radius. These results highlight the intricate interplay of spatial factors and pricing strategies in an economically diverse urban environment, offering insights that are relevant not only to this specific case but also to similar markets around the world."

This action has a huge repercussion in daily activities. That is the main reason why the study of human gait has an important relevance in order to maintain a healthy gait. This paper shows a simple method of gait subphases segmentation using a smart insole with custom-made capacitive sensors, plantar pressure measurement and center of pressure (COP) calculation. Pilot tests were performed in 6 healthy volunteers. The results show that using the information of plantar pressure in heel, hallux, 1st and 5th metatarsal is possible to recognize the stance and swing phase of the gait and calculate COP. Analyzing the position and trajectory of COP the system is capable to segment the stance phase of gait in 4 subphases, according to the different support zones and its correlation with COP trajectory."

One of the factors that determines this reality is the belief that the pedagogical space in which future lawyers, judges, prosecutors and other legal actors are trained must exclusively seek the development of the cognitive capacities of students. This article aims to open reflection towards spheres of legal training that escape traditional rationality. This is practical-normative research that seeks to advance the discussion on how emotions can be part of the classroom and the didactic-pedagogical concerns of Law professors. To do this, the experience of Professor Senthorun Raj, at Keele University, is called upon. It is concluded that the topic of emotions can be worked on in autonomous subjects or transversally based on a critical-reflective intention. Reflecting on the loyalties of law through emotions is a powerful methodological-critical key."

The School of Medical Technology at the aforementioned university implemented a virtual mode of Grand Round during the pandemic to enable students to develop clinical reasoning, communication skills, and the ability to integrate knowledge. The objective of this article is to characterize the implementation of their strategy in the ophthalmology and bioanalysis specialties. Student interactions observed in the classes are analyzed using a phenomenological approach and a study designed on the basis of an intrinsic case study. The results suggest two main dimensions: first, the involvement of the students, and second, the mediation of the teachers. In conclusion, the Grand Round is an opportunity for active and meaningful learning that requires ensuring conditions for the best interaction of students and to enhance their positive attitude."

Specifically, I show how the Research Excellence Frameworks’ impact policy in the UK was an object first managed by policymakers but later released as an object of concern for professional academics, including philosophers. I follow ‘impact’ through texts, events and testimonies about its doings with a special interest in its creation, its polemical encounter with philosophers, its management and issues about its definition and the assessment criteria used and experienced by philosophers. I conclude with some remarks on the effects that the circulation and writing of impact case studies had on producing a social valorisation and attachment to impact, even amongst philosophers."

Our argument is that ""abstraction"" is a third term that challenges the customary divorce between these domains in sociology inasmuch as interrogates their complex mediation in social life. To do so, we explore the possibilities of a sociology of abstraction as an exercise of thinking and observation aimed at: (i) comprehending the immersion of social theory's practices of abstraction as immanent to the dynamics of abstraction of society; and (ii) deciphering the concrete movement of concepts that give form to society and durability to social relations. Thus, we intend to show that the project of a sociology of abstractions consists in an unavoidable reflexive retreat that displays concepts in order to reach what is beyond concepts."

This network is composed of the sum and interrelation of the unintended consequences of “planning certainties” and forms within the blind spots of experts who believe their assumptions are certainties. Informed by theories of governmentality, performativity and scientific controversies, we hold that in the face of simplistic planning, resistance has taken form as heterogeneous governmentality, an overflowing of frames and a series of conflicts between nonprofessional and experts. We assess this phenomenon through a case study in Urban Megaprojects planning: The Alerce Satellite City in Chile’s Tenth Region."

It concentrates on the main roles that pragmatism plays in Latour’s ontology and it proposes understanding his perspective toward reality as ‘pragmatic realism’. On this basis, the article explores Latour’s relationship with pragmatic realism in four ways. Firstly, it presents the central claims of pragmatic realism expressed in the works of William James and Hillary Putnam. Secondly, it analyzes Latour’s concept of ‘circulating reference’ as a concrete approach to relating language and objects in a sense that is compatible with pragmatic realism. Thirdly, it explores the connection between circulating reference and Latour’s broadest ontological claims. Finally, the article concludes arguing that ‘pragmatic realism’ is a formula that may also be used to describe Latour’s own realistic ontology."

However, little evidence is available regarding the presence of self-regulation scaffolding behaviors in preschool teachers, and how they vary throughout the year and in different learning experiences. Less is known about these behaviors in Latin American preschool contexts. The main goal of this study was to develop a coding system to examine and compare preschool teachers’ self-regulation scaffolding behaviors at the beginning and end of the school year in two learning experiences (i.e. greeting time and math instruction). Participants were 18 Chilean preschool teachers (M age = 37.17 years; SD = 8.83). Seventy video segments were coded based on teacher behaviors targeting children’s self-regulation. The coding system included three scales: Instructional Strategy, Management Organization, and Warmth Responsivity. Research Findings: Findings revealed a greater presence of teachers’ self-regulation scaffolding behaviors in the Instructional Strategy scale than in the Management Organization and Warmth Responsivity scales. Also, the presence of teachers’ self-regulation scaffolding behaviors in the Instructional Strategy and Warmth Responsivity scales was related to the type of learning experience. Practice or Policy: The description of self-regulation scaffolding behaviors in Chilean preschool teachers contributes to understanding the role of teachers in the preschool context."

Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the unique contributions of these components to distinctive early numeracy and literacy skills in preschool children. Moreover, most studies have not considered the covariance between these early academic skills in preschool-aged children. The present study examined whether there are differential contributions of visual–spatial and verbal short-term memory, working memory, and response inhibition to specific early numeracy and literacy skills in preschool-aged children, taking into account the covariance among these outcomes. Several seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) analyses were conducted with 419 Chilean preschool-aged children (M = 53.9 months; SD = 4.22). The results show that both response inhibition and verbal short-term memory uniquely predicted all academic outcomes; working memory predicted all early academic skills (with the exception of verbal counting); and visual–spatial short-term memory predicted all numeracy skills and receptive vocabulary. When comparing the marginal effects of the EFs on the outcomes, response inhibition more strongly predicted applied problems than did working memory. Both visual–spatial short-term memory and response inhibition had a greater effect on explaining applied problems, compared to early decoding skills. Implications for teachers and interventions are discussed."

This construct would be related to multiple characteristics of the child as well as of the adult. Different studies show that factors like the sex of the child, the socioeconomic level of the family, the educational level of the mother, among others, are variables that predict differences in sensitivity of the mother. Based on those studies, the present paper aims at exploring the predictive power of some of those variables in a sample of Chilean mother-child dyads. All children were 1 year old and attended child care centers. The mothers' sensibility was assessed by the Adult Scale of Sensibility, E.S.A (Santelices et to, 2012) and the socio-demographic variables by a questionnaire validated in previous studies. The results show that both the educational level of the mother, her age and the family's socioeconomic level are statistically significant predictors for the mothers' sensibility."

By examining the construction techniques, spatial organization, contents, and chronology of these architectures, we explore the technology of underground storage in the valleys and discuss the development of a community management system rooted in a process of productive intensification. We suggest that during the Late Intermediate Period, community storage in these settlements began in public spaces, as part of a local agricultural production management system, mostly of maize but supplemented with beans, tubers, and fish, driven mainly by populations living in the valleys and foothills. These local systems, centralization, and productive specialization around maize reached a peak during the Late period, because of the Inca political intervention, in parallel with the establishment of state storage systems in the foothills."

Our analysis brings up to date a material and historical memory, challenging the classical vision that has underestimated the role of corporate work and decentralized community organizations. This is consistent with current perspectives that view these organizations as agents of change, capable of developing their own large-scale, long-term agricultural projects, as has been the case in the hyperarid lowlands of the Atacama Desert. Complementarily, these memories allow us to highlight the ontological dimension of this indigenous agriculture, granting agency to other non-human entities with whom humans are closely intertwined and coordinated in the construction of this Tarapacan landscape. This creates an intricate socio-natural and temporal assemblage in which any attempt to separate nature from culture is a fruitless task."

Municipal bidding war between private landfills in Santiago de Chile | KEYWORDS: Circular economy; Developing countries; Global South; Political economy; Sustainability | ABSTRACT: Decentralisation and privatisation shaped infrastructure allocation in many developing countries that underwent structural readjustment policies. Chilean municipalities exemplify these trends: they were shaped under neoliberal policies imposed during the dictatorship led by Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990). The case of landfill siting and waste disposal contract allocation in the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA) illustrates this regime inspired by local government competition and privatisation. This research dives deep into the origins and dynamics of ‘competition in the market’ among three private landfills. It then proposes a transshipment optimisation model to assess monetary costs and greenhouse gass emissions from waste transfer to landfills in 42 municipalities. This methodology allows evaluating decentralisation and privatisation of landfill siting and disposal contract distribution in the SMA. Our model shows a potential reduction of 18.31 percent of the total monetary cost of transfer, disposal and treatment, 32 percent of monetary waste transfer costs, and 1.72 percent of green house gas generated by transfer, disposal and treatment. In conclusion, the existent market structure has not fully optimised origin–destination monetary and environmental costs, leaving significant room for improvement through coordination and development of more targeted forms of public–private partnerships."
1282,-1,"TITLE: Intervening public spaces by subtraction: A randomised controlled trial in Montevideo, Uruguay | KEYWORDS: Field experiment; incivilities; Latin America; RCTs; Trash bins; Waste management | ABSTRACT: Perceptions of quality and safety are key determinants of people's use of green public spaces. Waste mismanagement, and particularly littering, are among users' main concerns. This research helps fill three gaps in the literature. First, we introduce a counter-intuitive approach of intervening public spaces by subtraction instead of addition (i.e. removal of street furniture). Second, we conducted a randomised controlled trial with a structural intervention in a real-life field setting. Third, we provide an empirical study from the Global South (Uruguay) on a topic - littering - that has mostly been studied only in the Global North. We assess the effect of removing trash bins on the amount of waste in public squares and on citizens' perceptions regarding the infrastructure, greenspace, cleanliness, and overall condition of the squares. We found that the intervention reduced the amount of litter in the squares by an estimated 43.5 %, yet did not significantly affect people's perception of square cleanliness. Our research provides evidence of the impacts of these interventions, and also highlights the need to further explore the causal mechanisms behind perceptions of quality green public spaces."

However, the quantitative scope of these grassroots infrastructures is difficult to measure. This research provides the first comprehensive quantitative account of community kitchens (CKs) in an entire metropolitan area, using Santiago de Chile as a case study. The aims are, first, to identify links between territorial presence of CKs and variables that have been observed in qualitative studies and smaller sample surveys; second, to determine data validity and collection bias between different sources of data on CKs; third, to estimate the number of beneficiaries of CKs at a metropolitan scale during the 2020 lockdowns. Data was collected from 52 municipalities and independent volunteer networks, accounting for 1517 CKs. Regression models are used both to analyse correlations with territorial variables and to impute values when data is not available. In one day, CKs in Santiago were able to benefit more than 230,000 people. Presence of CKs was significantly correlated with lower socioeconomic indicators and higher percentage of female heads of households, confirming expected links from the qualitative literature. The article generates evidence of the infrastructural scale of community kitchens during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic."

This article provides the first known quantitative approach to the link between urban lawlessness and internet provision. Taking the Santiago Metropolitan Region (SMR)–the capital of Chile–as a case study, the authors discuss the origins of Red Zones (areas where telecommunication companies do not provide fixed broadband). A first hypothesis is based on the corporate excuse given by telcos for Red Zones: criminal activities–and not just socioeconomic discrimination–are a force majeure that impede internet connectivity in specific neighbourhoods. An alternative hypothesis acknowledges criminal governance in Latin American cities, admitting the possibility of criminal redistribution being favourable to internet connectivity where state control is contested. Employing a random effects regression model with panel data from 52 boroughs during the 2012–2020 period, the two hypotheses are tested. Contestation of the territorial control by the state is significantly and positively correlated to fixed broadband connectivity in the SMA. In contrast, lower connectivity is linked to higher presence of poor households, favouring a profit-based explanation for the Red Zones. The results hold when replacing the percentage of contested territory per borough with the murder rates. This research contributes to heterodox views within institutional economics and highlights the need of state-led redistribution in order to retake control of contested territories."
1285,-1,"TITLE: The role of socio-territorial conditions and distance to infrastructure for promoting recycling in Latin American cities: The case of Santiago de Chile | KEYWORDS: Drop off points; Global south; Recycling; Walking distance; Waste separation | ABSTRACT: Convenient distances and higher density of drop-off points are expected to increase the probability of people participating in waste separation. However, although several analyses search for optimal distances between users and drop-off points, they tend to concentrate on European case studies. Few studies have analysed the actuallyexisting experiences regarding these factors in cities from the Global South. In this context, the authors provide an analysis on Santiago, the capital of Chile. A survey (N = 387) is generated to represent five neighbourhood clusters, and a logit binary outcome model is used to analyse the data. The research also considers territorial conditions based on the specific characteristics of the Latin American cities, particularly socioeconomic variables and location (i.e. centre versus periphery). The findings point towards a prominent role of educational levels, and an inverted U relationship between proximity to drop off points and the probability of recycling. Additionally, in the case of metals, results indicate that probability of recycling is higher both in the areas that concentrate the poor and in those that concentrate the rich. Such result is most likely associated to a contrasting relationship between recycling and socioeconomic variables: one linked to the need of generating income, and the other to privilege (i.e. conspicuous consumption and domestic workers)."
1286,3,"TITLE: Income inequality and rule-systems within public transport: A study of Medellín (Colombia) and Santiago (Chile) | KEYWORDS: Buses; Comparative analysis; Metro cables; Social policy; Trains; Transport affordability | ABSTRACT: The objectives of reducing income inequality and providing sustainable transport systems are part of the Sustainable Development Goals and are inter-related. On the one hand, income distribution influences transport decisions and accessibility. On the other hand, transport can be a source of redistribution by facilitating access to opportunities, and by being a target for public spending. Yet, two schools of economic thought, neoclassical economics and institutionalist political economy, expect contrasting effects of income inequality on public transport demand and supply. This research empirically explores how income inequality at the city level is linked to socioeconomic distribution of supply and satisfied demand. The article compares two highly income-unequal Latin American cities: Santiago (Chile) and Medellín (Colombia). Both quantitative descriptive analyses and qualitative semi-structured interviews are used to analyse the cases. Aligned with subjective perceptions captured in interviews, the quantitative results show that, although both cities have similar income distributions, allocation of supply and satisfied demand among income groups is different. One of the most notable achievements of Medellín is to avoid socioeconomic segregation between buses and the metro network, as it occurs in Santiago and other cities studied by the literature. Furthermore, the analysis highlights unwritten rule-systems, or informal institutions, that influence income distribution within public transport."

Procurement of key supplies is one of the components that operate in a decentralized manner, forcing local governments to compete against each other. This was the origin of what has been called the “bidding wars” between subnational governments at the beginning of the pandemic response. These wars led to centralization policies in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. Yet, less is known about cases from the Global South. By analyzing the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in the 320 Chilean municipalities in charge of primary health, this research provides evidence of the impacts of horizontal government competition on the ability to procure key supplies. In Chile, during the 2020 response to the pandemic, richer municipalities were able to procure more face masks per population, while economies of scale rewarded bigger purchases with lower prices. The authors support the theoretical notion of “concurrency” as a concept that adds nuances to the centralization-decentralization debate. In Chile, for instance, while testing and tracking required decentralization, PPE purchases could have probably benefited from centralization in order to avoid reproducing territorial inequalities."
1288,6,"TITLE: Urban sustainability and perceived satisfaction in neoliberal cities | KEYWORDS: Cities; Discontent; Latin America; Neoliberal; Satisfaction; Urban sustainability | ABSTRACT: In light of growing levels of urbanisation globally, the concept of urban sustainability has become an increasingly important element of the general discussion on sustainable development. However, few studies have addressed the various dimensions of sustainability and the different territorial scales on which day-to-day urban life takes place. Instances of discontent and social crisis have become commonplace in many of the world's major cities. Around the globe, inequality is seen as associated with a neoliberal urbanisation process that offers few solutions to issues of social exclusion and the climate crisis. The present work proposes the use of households' perceived satisfaction when analysing urban sustainability in neoliberal cities. Data is taken from the Sustainable Urban Development Perception Survey, conducted in the two main metropolitan areas of Chile, a country that since the 1970s has been widely considered to be a prime example of orthodox neoliberalism. We propose and test new dimensions with which to address urban sustainability, through the lens of perceived satisfaction, a key element in the analysis of the discontent that is sweeping across major cities globally."
1289,5,"TITLE: Housing and accessibility after the COVID-19 pandemic: Rebuilding for resilience, equity and sustainable mobility | KEYWORDS: Cycling; Disaster resilience; Housing; Job accessibility; Public health | ABSTRACT: A more sustainable post COVID-19 world requires urban transport policies aiming for resilience, social equity and decarbonisation. Instead of just focusing on the transport sector, the authors propose an integrated approach to housing and mobility. This approach acknowledges the challenges posed by inadequate housing and dependence on motorised transport during the COVID-19 crisis. In contrast, adequate housing and cycling became paramount resources while confronting the pandemic. Using Santiago de Chile as a case study, this research examines how different relocation scenarios for its current housing deficit cannot only affect the ability to implement stay-at-home measures, but also the potential of cycling as a relevant commuting alternative. The current location of the families suffering this deficit is compared to three scenarios: compact, pericentral and extended. In light of the learnings from the COVID-19 crisis, a housing-cycling policy becomes a tool for resilience; equity is achieved by enforcing the right to housing, by increasing job opportunities among the poor, and by reducing the dependence on expensive motorised transport; decarbonisation is achieved by promoting active transportation and reducing the dependence on motorisation."
1290,3,"TITLE: The rich and mobility: A new look into the impacts of income inequality on household transport expenditures | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: An increasing interest in transport affordability has brought attention to the factors driving household transport expenditure. Existent income inequality is part of what drives this interest. However, the possible causal link between income distribution and household transport expenditure is scarcely studied in the literature. In addition, the few existing studies only focus on post-tax income distribution. This paper provides the first known analysis that includes both pre-tax and post-tax income distribution, and a specific focus on the richest one percent. Random effects regressions and instrumental variables are used to analyse panel data covering 14 OECD countries during the 1992–2016 period. Inequality has an effect on overall household transport expenditure, and more specifically on purchase of vehicles and operation of private transport equipment. The pre-tax share of the rich increases overall expenditure on purchases of new private vehicles, with a decreasing effect when market inequality is high. The post-tax share of the poor has an effect on operation of transport equipment, but the sign of this effect depends on the existent level of post-tax inequality."
1291,-1,"TITLE: The written and unwritten rules of internet exclusion: inequality, institutions and network disadvantage in cities of the Global South | KEYWORDS: digital divide; Global South; inequality; institutions; Internet | ABSTRACT: Studies about the link between income and Internet access tend to focus exclusively on the demand side, or, when considering the supply side, to neglect any possible role of local and informal institutions. This research pays attention to the relationship between income distribution and Internet access within metropolitan areas of the Global South, with a special emphasis on local and informal institutions that could shape the ways by which this relationship works. Using a mixed-methods approach, two Latin American metropolitan areas are analysed: Santiago (Chile) and Medellín (Colombia). Although income is clearly linked to household Internet access in both cases, there are supply-side differences that can influence the income-connectivity nexus. The author proposes to introduce the concept of ‘institutionally generated network disadvantage’. Examples of formal and informal institutional factors are redlining, informal housing, socio-spatial segregation, tax exemptions and local public provision of services. The urban poor seem to be the most affected by institutionally generated digital exclusion."
1292,-1,"TITLE: Waste Political Settlements in Colombia and Chile: Power, Inequality and Informality in Recycling | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: There are stark differences between the waste recycling literature from the global North and that from the global South. The literature from the global North tends to focus on empirical analyses of existing municipal recycling services and rarely considers institutional factors. When it does, the theoretical approaches adopted are limited, especially regarding the role of informal institutions. In contrast, recycling literature from the global South does focus on informal institutions, but it does so by concentrating on the struggles of waste pickers rather than on the performance of waste management services provided by local authorities. This divergence in the literature suggests the need for an analytical framework that integrates institutions and recycling performance. This article analyses waste disposal regimes in two Latin American metropolitan areas, Medellín (Colombia) and Santiago (Chile), and explores the link between income inequality and recycling. It focuses on the political settlements that lie at the heart of the waste regimes. As such, waste regimes in these two cities are understood to be a product of the interplay of balances of power, institutions and distribution of benefits. The study also highlights the need to understand informal institutions as relational phenomena that affect both the rich and the poor, and not just as a subsistence strategy by the latter."
1293,3,"TITLE: Why do more unequal countries spend more on private vehicles? Evidence and implications for the future of cities | KEYWORDS: Electric cars; Household expenditure; Income inequality; Institutional political economy; Mobility; Smart city; Transport consumption | ABSTRACT: Household transport expenditure (HTE) can account for issues of transport affordability and of how mobility interacts with other needs. Income inequality, on the other hand, is crucially linked to both transport demand and institutions that can shape transport regimes. However, existent literature has scarcely linked income inequality and HTE. This research provides evidence about this link. Income concentration by the richest 10 per cent of the population is found to be significantly, positively and exogenously correlated with HTE on purchase and use of private transport equipment. The proposed econometric models can explain close to half of the variance of this type of HTE among countries. Two theoretical explanations are proposed and debated. One is demand-based, and the other supply-based. The latter is preferred over the former, stating that income concentration by the elites is a proxy of a balance of power that is associated to private-oriented transport regimes. Such regimes promote private goods over public goods or, in other words, car dependency, transport disadvantage, and/or informal transport over strong public transport networks. A fundamental challenge for the future of cities is that more unequal societies are in danger of producing wider inequalities after adopting private-oriented smart transport technologies."

We use these ideas to imagine well-being as differential materializations, entanglements of human, and the non-human agencies that “intra-act” with each other and are inseparable from how we know about them and our responsibilities in their reconfigurations. From this perspective, we see well-being as a phenomenon, underpinning its dynamism and processuality. Analyzing an interview fragment, we exemplify how Barad's theorizations can offer a different way to think about well-being, recognizing the differences within and the consequences of thinking about it as being otherwise. We argue that this approach opens new possibilities and research trajectories that expand the field of well-being studies, understanding well-being studies as a more local, dynamic, open-ended phenomenon."

The study uses two instruments, the external and standardized observation by international protocol using CLASS and also explores the perspective of children by analyzing their drawings of the same classes. Both approaches deliver relevant, consistent and complementary data, showing significant differences between classroom from schools with improvement trajectories and schools of the comparison group. Studied classrooms exhibited better pedagogical interactions and the exacerbation of teacher-centered practices, which are negatively correlated with quality interactions."

By leveraging publicly available data, such as satellite images, social media posts, or official records, to expose misinformation and create actionable insights, organizations like Bellingcat or Forensic Architecture have used digital verification to correct misinformation and shape the political agenda. OSI methods and practices, historically developed in fields such as security studies and intelligence analysis, are now experiencing an unprecedented demand across newsrooms, journalism schools, and other civic journalistic organizations trying to upskill their members. In this Invited Forum, we approach the topic of institutionalization of OSI from four distinct vantage points: discussing OSI as an institution itself, tracing innovations adopted by the journalistic profession, examining the institutionalization of grassroots organized OSI groups, and exploring how OSI can be taught within journalistic institutions."

While AI complicates and challenges some existing professional, social, political, and economic structures, it also offers new ways to realize desired journalistic objectives that were previously considered to be impractical, if not impossible. Drawing on four orienting ideas—adoption and hype, power and dependency, audiences and democratic implications, and education and empowerment—we unpack the implications of this AI turn in journalism and the consequences for the future of the journalistic field."

The influence of audience metrics on the editorial freedom of RTL Nieuws journalists Op zoek naar balans De invloed van audience metrics op de redactionele vrijheid van RTL Nieuws-journalisten | KEYWORDS: audience metrics; commercial news organisations; editorial autonomy; editorial decision-making; news production processes | ABSTRACT: This article investigates the impact of audience metrics on journalists' editorial autonomy. The study utilizes eleven interviews with RTL Nieuws editorial members to gain insight into the influence of Smartocto, a tool for audience metrics, on the news production process. Through qualitative analysis, the experiences and perceptions of the journalists are analyzed. The interviews reveal that Smartocto does have an impact on the news production process of RTL Nieuws. The audience metrics provide journalists with insights into the preferences of the audience and can be used as a basis for editorial decisions. However, despite this influence, journalists retain their autonomy and have the freedom to make their own journalistic judgments. This research contributes to the understanding of the impact of audience metrics on the editorial autonomy of journalists. It demonstrates that while these data play a role in the news production process, journalists can still make their own journalistic choices."

As news organizations, especially small-scaled, low-budget ones, strive to engage and retain their readership, metrics analysis provides invaluable insights into audience preferences and behaviors. However, the use and misuse of audience metrics also risk increasing the dependency of small-budget newsrooms on media platforms and metrics technologies. Drawing from thirteen semi-structured interviews with ten editors and three managers from local news media conglomerates in South Holland, our findings reveal that editors and managers rely heavily on metrics such as clicks, views, and best-read stories to inform agenda-setting decisions. This reliance is further entrenched as these metrics are embedded in all-in-one editing suites, making them a constant presence and difficult to escape in the daily news production workflow. While editors in hyperlocal newsrooms display a generally positive attitude toward innovation and metrics adoption, they also demonstrate awareness of the risk of prioritizing “scoring” over “informing.” Although this article enhances our understanding of innovation in hyperlocal newsrooms and underscores the importance of audience metrics in shaping editorial choices, it also highlights the dependent position that small-scaled local newsrooms find themselves in."

The emergence of new, low-cost communication channels and the speed of social networks put pressure on these agencies’ key role in satisfying local markets and audiences. This article seeks to understand how international news agencies adapt to these new models and processes in Chile. Based on 16 semi-structured interviews with professionals from the most important agencies with offices in Chile (AP, Reuters, AFP, EFE, and Xinhua), the results of this article show an undermined professional status due to the casualization of correspondent work and even its dismantling, findings which are consistent with previous studies in other contexts. However, this article identifies local particularities of this work that navigate between the tensions of a political economy and professional roles in a scarcely studied journalistic culture, marked by the flexibilization and precariousness of working conditions. In this way, correspondents verbalize the dismantling of their status (unknown), their working conditions (precarious), and their professional boundaries (multifaceted)."

Exploratory Evidence from Four Dutch News Organisations | KEYWORDS: artificial intelligence; automated journalism‌; information sharing; journalism; Knowledge silos; responsible AI | ABSTRACT: The effective adoption of responsible AI practices in journalism requires a concerted effort to bridge different perspectives, including technological, editorial, and managerial. Among the many challenges that could impact information sharing around responsible AI inside news organisations are knowledge silos, where information is isolated within one part of the organisation and not easily shared with others. This study aims to study how knowledge silos might affect the adoption of responsible AI practices in journalism through a cross-case study of four Dutch media outlets. We examine individual and organisational barriers to AI knowledge sharing and the extent to which knowledge silos could impede the operationalisation of responsible AI initiatives inside these newsrooms. To address this question, we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with a strategic sample of editors, managers, and journalists at de Telegraaf, de Volkskrant, NOS, and RTL Nederland. The interviews aimed to uncover insights into the existence of knowledge silos, their effects on responsible AI practice adoption, and the organisational practices influencing these dynamics. Our results emphasise the importance of creating better structures for sharing information on AI across all layers of news organisations and highlight the need for research on knowledge silos as an impediment to responsible AI production."

Despite these efforts, research shows little success in curbing the issue of hostility towards media professionals. With this article, we aim to explore journalists’ perceptions regarding online harassment and the responsibility that they attribute to the media organizations they work for, as well as digital platforms for allowing violence to spread online. Our study is based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in two Chilean newsrooms, including interviews with media professionals responsible for moderating hate. This article discusses the experiences of reporters who have faced online threats and attacks while reporting the news. Our findings show that digital platforms have provided new opportunities for violent behavior against journalists. More remarkably, some journalists are worried that their media organizations might prefer to benefit from the increased engagement and metrics that come with such aggressive actions. Our findings shed light on the challenges journalists face in the digital age and the need for more significant protection measures."

However, practitioners face novel challenges related to the tension between journalism’s transparency ideals and its duty to safeguard the privacy and security of data subjects. This article explores this tension by drawing on data from eight in-depth interviews with professional open-source investigative journalists in the Netherlands. The findings of our study reveal that OSINV investigators rely heavily on personal assessments and ongoing dialogues with colleagues to make privacy-related editorial choices, as rules and guidelines have only recently emerged. This research provides valuable insights into the intricacies of OSINV journalism, uncovering the delicate balance between journalistic transparency and privacy/security considerations."

As a result, journalists are increasingly forced to choose between silence and survival, with many opting for the latter in the form of diaspora relocation. This article investigates the role of kinship in community building among diaspora journalists, highlighting how these networks impact their collaboration and resource mobilisation. Drawing from interviews (n = 12) with reporters and editors from Latin America, Hong Kong, and the Middle East, this article examines diaspora journalists’ changing roles and proactive measures in establishing inclusive information and educational infrastructures, enhancing advocacy and empowerment for their communities. Findings demonstrate how journalists leverage kinship to connect with their audiences and guide their journalistic practices, editorial choices, and technological adoption. Findings further revealed that the role of diaspora journalists is evolving into one characterised by what this article terms “civic information workers.” These civic information workers are not only reporters but also intermediaries who provide vital data and insights that facilitate the everyday life and integration of diaspora communities into new societies, thus using journalism as a tool for civic empowerment."

The prevalence of coding cultures and collaboration in newsrooms worldwide has risen, in part to tackle challenges related to information overflow. This collaboration has been facilitated partly by the popularization of low-cost code hosting platforms such as GitHub. GitHub is a well-known public code management system with a significant potential for transparency and collaboration between communities. This study aims to map how newsrooms employ GitHub as a trading zone for collaborative journalism. We analyze the GitHub activities of leading media outlets from 27 countries. Based on content analysis of the newsroom’s repositories and users’ profiles, we found that media organizations in the United Kingdom and the United States continue to be the primary code producers in GitHub. However, our results show that newsrooms in developing countries benefit from these codes by stargazing these projects. The results of this article have important implications for understanding how newsrooms across the globe use GitHub for collaboration and the role journalistic code plays in bringing together various collaborative initiatives and actors in journalism."

Moreover, networked journalists build these mediated personas—following platforms’ affordances—to better engage with fellow journalists and algorithmic audiences. Drawing on data from 15 in-depth interviews with Kosovar Albanian political journalists and editors, this article offers a unique perspective by examining the negotiation process between professional standards and journalists’ online personas on Twitter. Via their online personas, influenced by the audience and the platforms’ affordances and logic, journalists and editors have given rise to new role conceptions and standards in local political journalism. The results show that political journalists and editors in Kosovo view Twitter as a platform where they can display both professional and personal layers of their identity. Furthermore, they feel unrestricted by journalistic standards, taking on roles outside the traditional scope of journalism: as good citizens, they express opinions on political issues; as activists, they advocate for personally meaningful causes; but they also see themselves as mordant critics of political figures."
1310,13,"TITLE: Popularity-driven Metrics: Audience Analytics and Shifting Opinion Power to Digital Platforms | KEYWORDS: Audience metrics; digital platforms; editorial autonomy; journalism; opinion power; web analytics | ABSTRACT: As digital technologies have made their way into news production, allowing news organizations to measure audience behaviors and engagement in real-time, click-based and editorial goals have become increasingly intertwined. Ongoing developments in algorithmic technologies allow editors to bring their audience into the newsroom using specialized tools such as Chartbeat or Google Analytics. This article examines how these technologies have affected the composition of the audience and their power to influence news-making processes inside two Chilean newsrooms. Drawing on several months of newsroom ethnography, we identify how the pursuit of “clickable news” impacts editorial processes and journalistic priorities by changing the datafied audience opinion power behind news production. Shifts in opinion power, loss of control, and increased platform dependency may contribute to a concentrated media landscape. Our findings show that opinion power has shifted to a datafied version of the audience, raising new questions about platform dependency and editorial autonomy in media organizations. These results carry significant implications for understanding the chase for traffic in current multiplatform newsrooms and how this phenomenon impacts news production."

While these newfangled projects are ingenious, it argues that their innovations are also indicative of what Chilean citizen journalists and digital activists thought was missing from the already large ecology of media organizations in the country with regard to enacting authentic journalistic principles. Digital or online journalism is uninterrupted in its transformation of the ways in which information and communication technologies are being used by media workers.

1313,13,"TITLE: Reporting with WhatsApp: Mobile Chat Applications’ Impact on Journalistic Practices | KEYWORDS: ethnography; Journalism; media practices; newsroom; WhatsApp | ABSTRACT: Since its release in August 2009, WhatsApp has played a key role in the fast development and expansion of the contemporary polymedia environment within which humans interact with each other. Those in the media, and journalists in particular, have taken to this platform to use it as a way to share and receive information as well as to maintain regular, and sometimes more private, contact with their sources. The goal of this paper is to examine the incentives that underlie journalists’ decisions to turn to WhatsApp and the consequences that this mobile chat application has had on the newsmaking practices of reporters inside two Chilean newsrooms. Newsroom ethnography, including participant observation, is employed in this study to gain insight into journalists’ routines and their everyday usage of WhatsApp. The conclusions of this article suggest that the utilization of WhatsApp has impacted the relationship between journalists and sources both on a personal and professional level. New perceptions of intimacy and trust, camaraderie and obtainability, and temporality are observed among the journalists who use this application. These observations carry important professional and ethical implications for journalists navigating today’s media ecology, and show how technological and socioprofessional aspects are tightly interwoven."

It also looks at the emergence of new digital media organizations during the last decade in Chile as a response to a concentrated duopoly market in the country. To do so, this paper considers notions of technological and cultural innovation in the newsroom and the concept of media convergence form a technological point of view to explain the current situation of media and journalists’ habit us. Following Pavlik’s idea that “journalism has always been shaped by technology” (2000, p. 229), this article discusses that both new and old media had been influenced by the current state of the technology, and today they have to standardize their practices in order to maintain a fluent communication between the audiences and the news industry. Therefore, this article supposes that the convergence of digital practices does not only affect journalism as a profession, but also present a challenge to transform the way journalism is practice and the way news worker do their jobs. A case study of Chilean media organizations is used to illustrate the change in the relationship between news and their public."

During two school years we followed nine indigenous students (5 girls and 4 boys of Mapuche-Huilliche origin), conducting interviews and accompanying them to their activities at school and in the neighborhood. The main findings show how professional agency collaborates with the isolation and marginalization of this group of students and their families, amplifying educational inequalities. Likewise, the way in which the students internalize these practices, developing school disaffection, is also evidenced."

However, research confirms the existence of school practices that generate exclusion which particularly affect, on a daily basis, the most vulnerable young people. This article aims to describe the school experiences of a group of young people at risk of educational exclusion, and analyzes the mechanisms that amplify inequalities derived from the social position they occupy in their communities. To do this, the academic experiences of 3 boys (Ángel, Andrés and Pedro) and 3 girls (Francisca, Javiera and Paulina) are presented as part of a broader ethnographic study developed during 2 school years (October 2015 - April 2017) in a municipal school in a medium-sized city in the south of the country. The results show how the school not only reproduces, but also amplifies through school practices the situations of vulnerability of these young people. Among these practices, what we have called Early Interscholastic Mobility (miet) becomes a common form of expulsion from the school, and the last action of a chain of exclusions that, however, is presented to families as an “opportunity”."

We point out those conflicts through the following of mine workers commuting, whose daily movements put the local past and present in stress with each other, since their work dynamics today constantly modify the city of yesterday. Based on critical notions about the production of space and time, we understand urban space as an interrelation of mobility practices, while historicity as a socio-spatial production of historical time. Based on a multi-local ethnographic methodology, our results point to growing conflicts between the saltpeter and copper historicity in Iquique; specifically inscribed in dissimilar infrastructures, practices, and meanings."

Supplying running water for free to low-income communities is essential but can result in water wastage due to a potential indifference of non-paying end-consumers. The consequence is a loss of municipal water and financial resources. We outline a new strategy that rewards low-income communities for reducing water wastage. The incentive strategy promotes water conservation and community development and decreases recurring water-related public expenses. The concept is funded by a percentage of municipal cost savings yielded from the respective water conservation.

Although this field has seen significant advances in developing large-scale monitoring of smart cities, several challenges persist concerning the practical assignment of delivery personnel to customer orders. To address this issue, we propose an architecture to optimize the task assignment problem for delivery personnel. We propose the use of different cost functions obtained with deterministic and machine learning techniques. In particular, we compared the performance of linear and polynomial regression methods to construct different cost functions represented by matrices with orders and delivery people information. Then, we applied the Hungarian optimization algorithm to solve the assignment problem, which optimally assigns delivery personnel and orders. The results demonstrate that when used to estimate distance information, linear regression can reduce estimation errors by up to 568.52 km (1.51%) for our dataset compared to other methods. In contrast, polynomial regression proves effective in constructing a superior cost function based on time information, reducing estimation errors by up to 17,143.41 min (11.59%) compared to alternative methods. The proposed approach aims to enhance delivery personnel allocation within the delivery sector, thereby optimizing the efficiency of this process."

Drawing on the concepts of endogenous and exogenous privatisation, we question this statement, arguing that school privatisation can be disaggregated into four dimensions: private provision, restricted access, school competition and school autonomy. We operationalise these dimensions using indicators from the PISA school questionnaire. We explore changes cross-nationally between 2000 and 2018 in 35 educational systems, revealing increases in secondary school competition dynamics over time and some cases of substantial increases in autonomous school-level decision-making. We also provide an up-to-date landscape of school privatisation for 64 countries in 2018 and highlight the relevance of using a wide set of indicators to report the extent of privatisation, accounting for both endogenous and exogenous sides of the phenomenon. Finally, we discuss ways in which cross-national quantitative data collection on schools might be developed to produce a more appropriate quantification of privatisation."
1329,0,"TITLE: Re-examining the functioning of educational markets: Does the private-subsidised sector contribute to school diversification? | KEYWORDS: privatisation; public–private partnershipsvoucher schools; school choice | ABSTRACT: This article offers new empirical evidence regarding the limits of the premises of educational privatisation policies. Educational markets rely on the assumption that private participation has the potential to boost school diversification and open new educational opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Using a fresh empirical approach, we draw on the Chilean case to investigate this rationale, which remains a controversial issue in the global educational discussion regarding privatisation. We examine the assumption of diversification by analysing three aspects: the attributes used by private subsidised schools to position themselves in the educational market (‘Value Proposition’), the extent to which they embody these stated attributes and the alignment between them and parental preferences. Based on surveys and administrative records, our findings suggest that although schools display clear identities to position themselves in the educational market, there is also a mismatch between what some types of schools offer and what families receive. Our data also reveal a high level of social stratification between school types which cannot only be explained based on parental preferences or school admissions. We interpret the unfulfilled promise of diversification as a failure in the privatisation process. Based on these findings, we discuss the policy-related factors of incoherent and unequal diversification in the Chilean educational system."

Disentangling sources of peer effects on student achievement | KEYWORDS: school choice; School composition; tracking | ABSTRACT: Studies regarding school composition have been highly influential in the design of policies. However, methodological and conceptual controversies have hindered the emergence of a consensus on the existence, size, and direction of peer effects. Drawing on four cohorts of Chilean students (n = 620,044), this work analyses the extent to which the socioeconomic and academic classmates’ characteristics are associated with student attainment. The findings suggest a positive medium- to low-magnitude effect of increases in the peers’ academic performance. At the same time, there are almost no effects associated with changes in the classmates’ socioeconomic status. These findings are stable across school types and are not driven by the sorting of students within them. The results are interpreted in the context of a new nationwide reform aiming to foster school integration and taking advantage of peer effects interaction."

However, few efforts have been made in the educational arena to develop tools to measure this process. Most of the previous research has relied on narrow definitions about what is private and what is public. This work proposes a tool to measure the degree of publicness-privateness of school systems, avoiding binary separation of the concepts. We develop an index and test this tool in two different landscapes: London and Santiago. In these cases, it serves to illustrate major changes in the levels of public-private participation in both school systems, reflecting differences between the systems and over time. We conclude that the index has potential for development and use in the analysis of public and private dimensions in education in broader international contexts."

In England, no data is routinely recorded regarding these practices, and most research on student outcomes depends on a simplistic dichotomy between pupils grouped and ungrouped by attainment. We present the findings of a survey of attainment grouping practices in English secondary schools, providing an updated picture of the profile of attainment grouping in English and mathematics for students aged 11–16. Grouping in sets is dominant for mathematics and, while variants on mixed attainment grouping are frequently used for students aged 11–14 in English, the frequency of setting increases as students progress through secondary school. Schools with disadvantaged intakes are more likely to group by attainment. We also find that grouping practices are much more complex and dynamic in enactment than is implied by much of the literature and that teachers report that many schools adapt grouping strategies to meet the perceived needs of different cohorts. We provide an updated conceptualisation of grouping practices as a continuum and discuss its implications for current and future research."
1333,0,"TITLE: Chile’s enduring educational segregation: A trend unchanged by different cycles of reform | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Socioeconomic segregation continues to be a central issue for education systems in which market-driven reforms have been implemented. This study analyses trends of socioeconomic segregation in Chile (1999–2018), considering a period with an absence of policies aimed at reducing segregation (1999–2007) and a later stage (2008–2015) when measures were implemented with the potential to affect the socioeconomic composition of schools. Results show that the segregation of both disadvantaged and wealthy students increased to extremely high levels during the first period, and has not shown signs of any significant decrease since then. The slight reduction observed in the second period is associated with changes regarding school fees in the private subsidised education sector rather than the selectivity status of the schools. The challenges faced in fostering greater socioeconomic integration within a market-driven educational system are discussed in this article."
1334,0,"TITLE: School Segregation Across the World: Has Any Progress Been Made in Reducing the Separation of the Rich from the Poor? | KEYWORDS: PISA; School composition; School segregation | ABSTRACT: The segregation of secondary school students into different schools has important implications for educational inequality, social cohesion and intergenerational mobility. Previous research has demonstrated how between-school segregation varies significantly across countries, with high levels of segregation occurring in central European nations that ‘track’ children into different schools and much lower levels in Scandinavia. This paper contributes to this literature by examining whether industrialised countries have made any progress in reducing levels of between-school segregation over time. Using six waves of data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), this work shows how the segregation of rich and poor students has remained broadly unchanged across OECD countries. This is despite major economic and political events occurring during this period, along with the introduction of numerous policy initiatives designed to reduce socioeconomic gaps. Therefore, the conclusions indicate that structural factors are likely to be the main drivers of between-school segregation (e.g. neighbourhood segregation or long-standing school admission policies) and that education policymakers may need to be much more radical if they are to foster greater levels of integration between the rich and the poor."

Physical activity (PA) has recently been recognized as an evidence-based practice to decrease maladaptive behaviors and increase desired behaviors. Exercise has been found to increase academic engagement in students with ASD; however, little research has been completed on the effectiveness of physical exercise as a school-based intervention. PA has also been found to be an effective intervention to increase executive functioning (EF) in students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, little research has been completed on the effects of PA on EF in students with ASD. A multiple-baseline design was used to examine the effects of PA on academic engaged time and EF. Three students participated in a jogging intervention, were observed in the classroom, and completed EF measures. Results suggested large effect sizes for academic engagement for all three students. Although no significant effects were found on EF, results indicated PA may be an effective and feasible intervention to support academic achievement for students with ASD in schools."

This admission mechanism is usually favoured to foster equality of opportunities in education. However, there has not been an effort to systematise existing evaluations of this type of interventions. This review protocol proposes to contribute to the literature on this topic with a systematic search and a meta-analysis, from an international perspective, of the effects that randomised school admissions have on student academic performance and school socioeconomic composition measures. The results and policy implications will serve as a new and relevant contribution for researchers and policy makers related to school choice, and for education authorities involved with school lotteries."
1337,0,"TITLE: Failed regulations and school composition: selective admission practices in Chilean primary schools | KEYWORDS: School admissions; school composition; segregation; ‘selectivity’ | ABSTRACT: This is an exploratory study about pupil selection. Admission regulations are central to understanding issues of school mix, segregation and educational justice. In Chile, student selection has been intensively discussed but scarcely studied. Using a questionnaire for headteachers (N = 581), we explore how school admission processes are organised and implemented within a market-based educational system with a high-stakes testing regime where schools are pushed to use selection practices. Despite the existence of a national (although weak) legal prohibition at the time the survey was conducted, half of the headteachers state that they use some mechanism to select students (play sessions, student testing, or interviews with parents) even when they do not face demand pressures. Exploratory data suggest higher levels of selectivity in subsidised private schools. Regression analysis shows a strong association between ‘selectivity’ and homogeneous academic intake and social composition. Presumably, the widespread use of selection procedures responds to the structuring force of a double system of educational accountability; strong pressure on performance within a testing regime and where funding depends on enrolments makes selection a fundamental strategy for schools, but which is seriously affecting equality goals."

The analysis covers the cases of political prisoners during the Chilean dictatorship (1973–1990) and that of the people detained within the context of the social protest of October 18, 2019. The methodology used for this study includes desk research on secondary sources on gendered political violence and torture such as scholarly books, journalistic and academic articles, and non-governmental organization reports, analyzing their contents from a perspective based on human rights and gender. We argue that the crystallization of gender-based violence exerted by Chilean State agents is linked to the biases present in post-dictatorship reparation policy and reflect on the impact of these biases on the assurances of non-repetition of human rights violations."

At the end of a period of conflict and repression, States must address past human rights violations by establishing a series of measures among which, reparations to victims. In Chile, after the 1973-1990 civic-military dictatorship, one of these measures was the implementation of the Programa de Reparación y Atención Integral de Salud (PRAIS) [the Comprehensive Health Care and Reparation Programme]. The programme has brought about a number of benefits and is currently an international benchmark for this type of policy. Yet the design of the programme presents a series of gaps that have made the reparation task difficult to fulfil. The objective of this work was to analyse the PRAIS programme, assessing its claim to be a reparation policy of social rehabilitation and its adaptation to the human rights approach. Methodology. A qualitative analysis was conducted by applying two strategies: on the one hand, the model of the reconstruction of the programme rationale and on the other, the human rights-based approach. The documentary analysis of the instruments establishing the reparation policy guidelines were used as a source of data. Results. Social trauma and the need for its reparation were identified as a problem, notably the health effects caused by impunity. However, no actions aimed at solving that problem were found. Regarding the orientation of the programme, a biomedical approach was adopted that focused on repairing biopsychosocial damage. Other relevant factors that contributed to the damage caused were not considered, among which impunity, which has a retraumatising effect. Regarding the programme design, there was no explicit relationship between the goals and the strategies developed to effectively solve the problem. Lastly, the programme does not fully guarantee a dignified treatment for the victims and their families, nor their right to take action for human rights violations. Furthermore, the programme does not present a coherent gender or intersectionality perspective either, nor does it allow meeting the criteria that guarantee the right to reparation. Discussion. Given the gaps in the programme, we can affirm that PRAIS has undergone improvisation over time across different governments. Its coordination with legal services has been omitted, and the action of social services has been minimised. At the same time, the programme has been incorporated into a pre-existing sectoral policy of a general nature. Conclusions. The programme rationale does not guarantee the fulfilment of its objectives nor its approach to social trauma. On the contrary, the fact of integrating the programme into a pre-existing policy and of failing to contemplate specific intersectoral actions has hindered effective rehabilitation. For these reasons, the programme seems to be favouring the re-victimisation of its target recipients instead."

We highlight the university's role in the provision of legal services and the interdisciplinary and intersectoral work in this matter. To do this, we address the case of the legal consulting and Human Rights Clinic of the Law School of the University of Valparaíso (Chile). We use a qualitative method of systematization of experiences, relying on data collection techniques such as secondary sources review, observation, and four interviews to key informants. The results of the analysis allow us to illustrate the social contribution that this Clinic makes in the Valparaíso Region by means of the processing of legal cases, as well as its contribution to the development of transitional justice policies regarding victims' reparation. It also makes it possible to make visible difficulties and possible improvements in the processing of such cases. The systematization carried out is an example for this type of initiative to be implemented in other universities throughout the country, providing the students who graduated from the Law career with transversal competencies to litigate, in the criminal jurisdiction cases about crimes of It hurts humanity."

In this context and based on data from interdisciplinaryresearch on political and post-dictatorial culture, this article aimsto presentthe conceptions of justice held by stakeholders in transitional justice efforts in Chile. The results reveal that the conception of justice has gone from being centred on retributive and, residually, restorative justice to focusing onsocial or distributive justice. We conclude that a new constitution that includes this expanded notion of justice-which has been observed in the last decade and crystallized in the demands manifested in the social uprising-would represent the completion of a lengthy political transition."

For this, we analyze the discourses present in the debate on transitional justice in the public arena, developed in the country from the transition to democracy, based on the social constructionist approach and the model of the natural history of social problems. The analysis allows us to glimpse the various conceptualizations that have been delineating the public debate around the notions of truth and justice and their articulation in transitional public policies. The conclusions point to the decisive role of the human rights movement in promoting alternative responses and contribute to making victims visible as active actors in the political arena."

Spain occupies the first place in Europe in oocyte donation according to 2016 data from the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE). In 2016, 13, 823 cycles of treatment were performed in Argentina, with 2709 egg donation transfers (19.5%) (SAMeR, 2017). This study aims to visualize the socio-demographic profiles of two samples of oocyte donors from Argentina (n = 93) and from Spain (n = 49), the differences, if any, in the motivations presented by donors to enroll in oocyte donation programs and their attitudes towards anonymity. The study follows a quantitative methodology, while the inferences have been complemented with empirical research, specific literature and the revision of normative and regulatory documents. The data collection instrument was a questionnaire administered from March to October 2017 in three Fertility clinics (one of Buenos Aires and two from Madrid). It can be inferred from the results that in addition to the economic motivations, there are also altruistic reasons to become egg donors. Altruism is understood as the rhetorical construction of clinics and informed consents, designed to avoid mere mercantile consideration. Although a large percentage of women surveyed do not wish to meet people born from their eggs, most of them do believe that people should know the way they have been conceived."

The study was of an exploratory and descriptive nature, using a questionnaire based on previously validated scales of Notions of Human Rights in Social Work, and Commitment to Human Rights in Social Work. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods were used for analysis. In spite of the differences in student profiles in the three universities, all groups coincide in having few notions of human rights, in their elevated expectations regarding learning, and in their degree of commitment to learning. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of educational research on human rights in social work, in order to optimize educational programs in the area."

The aim of this study is to provide a profile of the literature in the field of social work covering human rights in recent years. For this reason, a descriptive-observational analysis was performed of the output on human rights in social science journals indexed between 2000 and 2015 in the principal international databases, ""Scopus"" and ""Web of Science"". A qualitative analysis permitted establishing four main types of topics. The findings reveal a lack of papers dealing with this subject, the predominance of a theoretical approach over an empirical one, and an Anglo-Saxon hegemony. This subject of study has never been approached before. Hence, innovation is the main contribution of this paper."

The study aimed to understand how the program addressed the challenges brought by the pandemic. Using semi-structured interviews and drawing from a pedagogy of connection, this study analysed data from nine participants, who were facilitators and coordinators of the PD program. The findings showed that participants identified three sources of challenges: personal, professional, and operational and that they presented the strategies used for addressing them. The strategies, in general, involved a better understanding of the contexts and teachers they served even though doing so prevented them from meeting some curricular goals. Their strategies highlighted the notions of flexibility, humanising aspects of communication, and innovation to overcome the limitation of using technology in pedagogical contexts."

We analyzed how these teachers’ positionings about the teaching/learning of writing shaped their identities and positionings in their classrooms. Using semi-structured interviews (Rubin & Rubin, 2012) and following a dialogical (Akkerman & Meijer, 2010) and narrative approach (De fina, 2012) to identity, we found that there were clear contradictions in the way that teachers presented themselves in their narratives, showing clear evidence of teacher identity being multiple and unitary, individual and social, continuous and discontinuous."

They are also valued intellectual tools that acquire special importance in the construction of knowledge and the regulation of thought. The purpose of this study is to analyze the development of argumentative writing of elementary school students in Chile whose teachers participated in a professional development program (PDP) based on a teaching/learning model centered on communicative problem solving through writing. Using a quasi-experimental mixed method, the argumentative writings of 238 students (experimental group= 124; comparison group= 114) were evaluated using a pre- and post-implementation test of the PDP through a rubric based on: (a) the autonomy of the written text; (b) discursive aspects; and (c) normative aspects. The results show that students in the experimental group performed better on the autonomy and discursive aspects of their final written assignments than their peers in the comparison group."

This paper analyzes the structure of piropos to see their effects in both the way piropos portray women, and the discourse piropos promote and/or maintain towards women. From a compendium (Memoria chilena, 2008), 67 piropos were selected and grouped based on the conceptual metaphor (Lakoff and Johnson, 2003) they use to represent women in society. Conceptual metaphors represented women as religious entities, food, criminals or offenders, and objects found in nature. A fifth metaphor included under the label ‘transfiguration’ represents the objectification of the one uttering the piropo in order to get closer to the receiver of this discourse practice. The methodology considered (1) power and social distance (Poynton, 1989; Kerbrat-Orecchioni, 1992) to understand the relationship between the participants of this practice, and (2) transitivity (Halliday, 2014) to understand how lexical choices of both processes and participants reflect how human experience is expressed. The analysis revealed that the piropos analyzed use several resources to perpetuate a male chauvinist discourse that objectifies women and considers them as inferior and, generally, powerless."

As a result, cognitive science has been a target for criticism from the epistemological and methodological point of view, which has resulted in the emergence of new approaches. Neurophenomenology has been proposed as a means to address these limitations. The methodological application of this discipline, even in its mildest form, enriches the methodology typically used in cognitive sciences. > problem: Nowadays psychological studies are difficult to replicate. As a way to achieve replication of results published in a previous study in order to develop a methodological adaptation suitable for electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements in a subsequent experiment, first-person accounts from the participants in our pilot study were included in the experiment construction. This study's objective is to show the benefit of including a mild-neurophenomenology-inspired approach in the adaptation from an original paradigm, which requires, foremost, the ability to replicate the original results. > method: Interviews with open and semi-structured questions were carried out at the end of an Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT). The first-person reports, together with the behavioral outcomes of each pilot, were taken into account for the development of the next piloting phase until replication of the original results was achieved, and the final experimental design was elaborated. > Results: A sequence of four pilots, where the integration of third- and first-person information derived from subjects' behavior and reported experiences while carrying them out rendered the behavioral replication we sought to achieve, providing support for a first-person enriched cognitive science paradigm. > implications: Including first-person accounts systematically during the development and performance of classic cognitive paradigms ensures that those paradigms are measuring what they claim to measure. This is the next logical step to improve replication rates, to refine the explanation of the results and avoid confounding third-person data interpretation. > Constructivist content: Including first-person experiences and acknowledging the active role that participants' experiences regarding the paradigm had in the modeling of its final version is in concordance with a constructivist standing."

Teamwork is a fundamental skill that all engineers must have in their professional career. It is for this reason that higher education institutions must train this skill in engineering students. Among the main results of the research it was found that engineering students work as a team with colleagues of the same career, but not with colleagues of different career. It was also found that there are no differences between the different higher education centers about what students do when working as a team. The practices that most students do is to actively communicate and listen to their peers and the least they do is effective collaboration."

1364,0,"TITLE: A Critical Review of Students’ and Teachers’ Understandings of Nature of Science | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: There is widespread agreement that an adequate understanding of the nature of science (NOS) is a critical component of scientific literacy and a major goal in science education. However, we still do not know many specific details regarding how students and teachers learn particular aspects of NOS and what are the most important feature traits of instruction. In this context, the main objective of this review is to analyze articles from nine main science education journals that consider the teaching of NOS to K-12 students, pre-service, and in-service science teachers in search of patterns in teaching and learning NOS. After reviewing 52 studies in nine journals that included data regarding participants’ views of NOS before and after an intervention, the main findings were as follows: (1) some aspects of NOS (empirical basis, observation and inference, and creativity) are easier to learn than others (tentativeness, theory and law, and social and cultural embeddedness), and subjective aspects of NOS and “the scientific method” seemed to be difficult for participants to understand; (2) the interventions most frequently lasted 5 to 8 weeks for students, one semester for pre-service teachers, and 1 year for experienced teachers; and (3) most of the interventions incorporated both decontextualized and contextualized activities. Given the substantial diversity in the methods and intervention designs used and the variables studied, it was not possible to infer a pattern of more-effective NOS teaching strategies from the reviewed studies. Future investigation should focus on (a) disentangling whether a difference exists between the easy and difficult aspects of learning NOS and formulating a theoretical explanation for distinguishing the two types of aspects and (b) assessing the effectiveness of different kinds of courses (e.g., history of science, NOS or informal) and strategies (e.g., hands-on vs. drama activities; SSI vs. HOS)."
1365,0,"TITLE: Theory, Evidence, and Examples of Teaching the Nature of Science and Biology Using the History of Science: A Chilean Experience | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: A significant number of science educators have recognized the importance of the history of science (HOS) in understanding the nature of science (NOS) and scientific content. However, there is little empirical evidence for this effect in the South American educational context. This article shows empirical data about the contribution of HOS in enhancing in-service biology teachers’ understanding of NOS and the effect of HOS in enhancing the understanding of evolution and NOS in high school students. The authors used the VNOS-D+ questionnaire to assess teachers’ and students’ views of NOS at the beginning and the end of interventions. The inclusion of writing artifacts such as lesson “tickets-out”, content tests, and lesson plans for teachers enriched the analysis. The students’ understanding of evolutionary theory was assessed using the ACORN questionnaire. Some of the most important results of the project are the significant improvements observed in teachers’ understanding of NOS, although they assigned different levels of importance to HOS in these improvements, and a significant effect of HOS with students’ understanding of NOS. There was no significant difference between students’ understanding of evolution in treatment and control classes. The authors make suggestions for science teacher education and future research to improve the effect of HOS on students’ and teachers’ understanding of NOS and scientific content."

Different instructional strategies such as decontextualized, hands-on inquiry, and history of science (HOS) activities have been proposed for teaching NOS. This article seeks to understand the contribution of HOS in enhancing biology teachers’ understanding of NOS, and their perceptions about using HOS to teach NOS. These teachers (N = 8), enrolled in a professional development program in Chile are, according to the national curriculum, expected to teach NOS, but have no specific NOS and HOS training. Teachers’ views of NOS were assessed using the VNOS-D+ questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of two modules about science instruction and NOS. Both the pre- and the post-test were accompanied by interviews, and in the second session we collected information about teachers’ perceptions of which interventions had been more significant in changing their views on NOS. Finally, the teachers also had to prepare a lesson plan for teaching NOS that included HOS. Some of the most important study results were: significant improvements were observed in teachers’ understanding of NOS, although they assigned different levels of importance to HOS in these improvements; and although the teachers improved their understanding of NOS, most had difficulties in planning lessons about NOS and articulating historical episodes that incorporated NOS. The relationship between teachers’ improved understanding of NOS and their instructional NOS skills is also discussed."

Based in two studies focused on qualitative analysis of interviews with vulnerable families, this paper shows the presence of senses linked to the logic of liberalization of public policies and processes of individualization in contemporary Chile. In the context of the current neoliberal model, there is predominance of a sense of individual and family management and addressing risks, to the detriment of the community and the State as institutional platforms to resolve problems. In fact, the interviews feel distrust and discontent about these two spheres of society. This issue becomes particularly problematic, within the framework of increased public and private efforts to deal with the poverty and vulnerability. Finally, this paper tries to show that the preeminence of senses as own merit and individual effort are always go with moral feelings that structure the different discourses."

However, collaboration does not occur spontaneously; instead it needs to be guided by appropriate scaffolding. In this study we explore whether a script that explicitly incorporates constructing arguments in collaborative problem-solving activities improves learning. In order to do so, a study was conducted involving 75 students from a lower-middle class state-subsidized private school in Santiago de Chile. These students were divided into three groups, each of which worked on geometry activities over 10 sixty-minute sessions that were held across a period of four weeks. To isolate the effect of incorporating technology, the first of these groups did not work with technology. The second group worked with a collaborative script that was developed for use with a tablet, while the third group used the same technology with an integrated tool that explicitly allowed the students to build arguments. We conclude that having students reflect on their own processes and outcomes by arguing their point of view can lead to an improvement in learning, more so than the technology itself."

We emphasize the degrees of inclusiveness through the distinction between scaling out and scaling up by using quantitative data related to business evolution during this period. We determine that the diversification of cooperative activities upstream and downstream combined with the preservation of smallholder access is a good indicator of IBs and inclusive ecosystems and, therefore, of scaling up. In contrast, while northern and eastern states have only low-level collection activities, the spatial concentration of large and diversified cooperatives in western Indian states shows a center-periphery structure, with scaling up taking place only in the center. The transfer of resources from mature to emerging cooperatives appears to be crucial, with consequences for both business model design and public intervention."

But the decarceration process that has taken place in some Latin American countries has not garnered the same interest. In Chile, the incarceration rate decreased substantially between 2010 and 2022, a process that has been scarcely studied. What are the causes behind this phenomenon? What factors explain the drop in the incarceration rate in Chile? By using a database containing the total number of admissions and releases from Chilean prisons between 2007 and 2018, we aim to answer these questions. Our analysis shows that the decrease in incarceration has been concentrated in violent crimes and drug offenses and it appears to be mainly associated with variations in police activity and a reduction in average prison stays. These findings have significant implications for the design and implementation of public policies aimed at preventing crime and promoting social reintegration."
1371,-1,"TITLE: From prison to work? Job-crime patterns for women in a precarious labor market | KEYWORDS: Chile; Female employment; Offending; Reentry; Sequence analysis | ABSTRACT: Finding and retaining a job is one of the most challenging problems women confront after being released from prison. Given the dynamic and fluid interactions between legal and illegal work, we argue that to better identify and describe job trajectories after release, we must simultaneously consider disparities in work types and offending behavior. We leverage a unique dataset – the Reintegration, Desistance and Recidivism Among Female Inmates in Chile study– to describe patterns of employment within a cohort of 207 women during the first year after being released from prison. By considering different types of work (i.e., self-employed/employed, legitimate/under-the- table) and including offending as another type of income-generating activity, we adequately account for the intersection between work and crime in a particularly understudied population and context. Our results reveal stable heterogeneity in employment trajectories by job type across respondents but limited overlap between crime and work despite the high levels of marginalization in the job market. We discuss the role of barriers to and preferences for certain types of jobs as possible explanations for our findings."

In a patriarchal society where parenting falls mainly on women, this has consequences for them and their children. This article explores to what extent the individual characteristics of the children, the context in which they are left and the mother’s conviction are related to greater reports of problematic behaviors. Using a representative sample of female prisoners in Santiago, Chile, and through logistic regressions, it is shown that older children who lived with their mother before incarceration and report problems with the person who is left in charge of their care outside prison are more likely to present problem behaviors. These results are robust when considering the mother’s prior risk, measured in substance abuse and recidivism."

The study uses data from 263 father-child-mother triads involved in the Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS) and the Rochester Intergenerational Study (RIGS). We use a dual trajectory model to examine the research questions. Results suggest that both paternal and maternal marijuana use during the child’s life increase the probability that a child will follow a moderate or high substance use trajectory during adolescence, beyond the risk incurred from paternal adolescent history of substance use. Some nuances related to the timing of concurrent parental marijuana use emerge across parent sex. The results highlight the important role of both caregivers in the explanation of patterns of discontinuity across generations, as well as the relevance of considering when the use occurred."

Since a large proportion of crimes are committed by a small group of individuals, preventive measures are often targeted on prolific offenders. There is a long-standing expectation that new technologies can improve the accurate identification of crime patterns. Here, we explore big data technology and design a machine learning algorithm for forecasting repeated arrests. The forecasts are based on administrative data provided by the national Chilean police agencies, including a history of arrests in Santiago de Chile and personal metadata such as gender and age. Excellent algorithmic performance was achieved with various supervised machine learning techniques. Still, there are many challenges regarding the design of the mathematical model, and its eventual incorporation into predictive policing will depend upon better insights into the effectiveness and ethics of preemptive strategies."

Understanding their characteristics and criminal trajectories can enlighten us regarding the different needs of women upon re-entering society after incarceration. Drawing on data from the Reinserción, Desistimiento y Reincidencia en Mujeres Privadas de Libertad en Chile study, this article identifies different profiles among a cohort of 225 women who were released from prison in Santiago, Chile, and demonstrates that significant heterogeneity exists among them in terms of their criminal trajectories and the intervention needs to support their transition out of prison."

However there is poor understanding about the way that these systems would be impacted by future climatic change on a regional scale. In this context, the need of a multidisciplinary approach in the climate change effects assessment arises as imperative. The design and implementation of the Eco-social Observatory of Climate Change Effects for High Altitude Wetlands of Tarapacá Region is presented here. Since 2013, the Observatory has been gradually implemented by the Centro de Estudios de Humedales in four high altitude wetlands from northern Chile, including two salt lakes and associated springs (Salar del Huasco: 20° 18' S-68° 50' W, 3800 masl; and Laguna Lagunillas: 19° 56' S-68° 51' W, 4100 masl), one high altitude fertile plaine (Copaquire: 20° 55'S-68° 53' W, 3,500 masl), and one ravine wetland (Iquiuca-Parca: 20° 01' S-69° 13' W, 2,500 masl). The Observatory is monitoring variables of the physical, biotic and social components of the environment, integrating different sources of knowledge from natural and social sciences. The understanding of climate change effects on natural and social systems will help to generate better predictions of their effects, providing new tools to design more efficient adaptation strategies in face of future climate change."

For this, metaphysical, linguistic and historical foundations are presented, and a contextualization composed of definitions of cultural identity, Latin American cultural identity and regional cultural identity. Regarding the latter, applications to the study of the Cultural Identity of the Region de los Rios are presented, due to the characteristics of this territory as a new region. The resulting concept describes the phenomenon as a sense of the regional being present in the cultural semiosphere, forming part of the collective memory and imaginary, manifested in the way of the thematic unity of a coherent and ordered historical narrative, progressively more complex and heterogeneous, which combines the linear progression of the subthemes and the constant theme of regional cultural identity."

For this objective, a comparative analysis is carried out between the main existential structures of the existential enlightenment present in ""Philosophy II"" of Jaspers and the existential analytic present in ""Being and time"" of Heidegger. From the amalgams evidenced between the two analytics, certain existential are deduced that are analyzed in their epistemic synergy and projected towards the outline of a possible ontoepistemology based on the structures: concept of human being, subject-object relationship (conscience) and researcher-researched relationship (research ethics). It was obtained a situated and projective conception of the human being, a subject-object relationship as a complex cleavage and a researcher-researched relationship founded on an existential communication framed in the discursive tradition of their respective semiotic community."
1379,-1,"TITLE: Cacao: Shade and nutrition effects under Amazonian conditions | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter presents recent findings about the response of cacao crop to resources, both nutrients and solar radiation, under Amazonian conditions. Here, we review the results of our studies generated at field trials, and we discuss the crop response to different sources of nitrogen fertilization, as well as the response of cacao to Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium (NPK) interaction. Ammonium sulfate significantly increased yield and fat seed in cacao compared to calcium nitrate and urea. Moreover, leaf nutrient movement during the productive season is described, finding substantial differences among elements and their leaf stages. We also discuss the effect of decreased solar radiation on growth and physiological traits. Mesh was used to reduce solar radiation. Shaded plants significantly reduced stomatal conductance; however, no significant effects on growth and foliar nutritional content were found, but there was an evident genotype effect. Although ammonium sulfate acidifies the soil compared to other N sources, its application improves yield, suggesting crop adaptation to acid soils, typically those of the Amazon region, and ammonium affinity. On the other hand, shade in the Amazon region conditions can alter physiological traits but does not affect plant growth, suggesting acclimatization to radiation modification."

It proposes a trajectory from diverse wars to a state of plenitude, peace and justice in Peru. Paralelly, the book proposes another trajectory: the act of rewriting as a “tool ontologically ours”, whose Andean base, components and equivalencies appear in the upper section of the book pages. Both trajectories are denominated “Hanan Nation” and “Hanan Tongue”, according to the Andean category of Hanan (above). This article examines the poetic “rewriting” of Peru that the book's aesthetic-ideological proposal represents. One can read this proposal in decolonial terms, and recognize the continuity of the different wars in Peru and their role in affecting native cultures and languages since colonial times until the internal war of the late 20th century, the specific moment in which Ramírez Ruiz wrote the book."

In Chile, this crisis arrived five months after the beginning of a social movement towards structural changes. This article argues that such a crisis, combined with a political awareness in Chilean society, led to a resurgence of mutual aid between musical workers. Given the state neglect, the absence of cultural policy suitable for artistic work, musical workers strengthened their organizations to help each other. Based on an interdisciplinary approach, we demonstrate the reflourishing practices and mutual aid values between music workers."

I argue that the perspective of musical labour allows understanding an eclectic musician such as Garrido in a comprehensive way, rather than isolated. Prior scholarship has studied his contribution to different genres rather than considering him as a musical worker. By analysing Garrido’s newspaper articles, I identify the main problems Chilean working musicians suffered and his proposals to overcome them. All these resulted in the First Musicians’ Congress in 1940. I conclude by highlighting the difficulty of defining the musical work and emphasising the need to understand musicians’ two-sided identity as labourers and artists in a perennial tension."

Due to the particularity of the Chilean case and its ""peaceful way to socialism"", this support was not without controversy. This article analyzes how New Song artists expressed their solidarity to both revolutions and how they either bypassed or deepened such conflicts. We present two findings. The first highlights the relevance of Chilean New Song in denouncing the American imperialism while showing solidarity with others. The second sheds light on the use of genres, instruments and intertextuality to support Cuba and Vietnam but also to validate the ""Chilean way"". Analyzing this repertoire through the notion of South-South solidarity is innovative since it unveils the strategies that musicians used to express their solidarity while integrating the ""Chilean way"" in the international context of the cold war."

Despite growing evidence in this area, traditional educational systems remain anchored in transmissive and cognitivist models, perpetuating barriers to equitable learning, particularly for students with special educational needs (SEN), such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD). In response to these challenges, post-cognitivist frameworks, including embodied, enactive, and environmentally scaffolded cognition (3E) as well as SpEED (Special Education Embodied Design), provide essential foundations for rethinking inclusive educational design. This perspective article explores the role of active teaching methodologies and innovative technologies in shaping a holistic framework to support inclusive learning design. This framework leverages immersive technologies, mobile applications, and artificial intelligence to scaffold multimodal learning experiences that meet the diverse needs of students with SEN. Through a proof-of-concept based on illustrative cases, this article presents a theoretical contribution to guide the design of inclusive and technology-supported learning environments aligned with the 3E approach, fostering engagement, equity, and personalized learning for students with SEN."

This study interrogates the forms of articulation between these schools and the companies, analyzing the main actions, agendas and institutional purposes that both the schools and the companies seek regarding each institutional needs and perspectives. We critically examine these articulations and relationships because, as a result of Chilean public policy in the area of TVET, which is intended to be an industry demand-oriented training policy, the mining industry is actively influencing the school training processes and curriculum, which does not necessarily result in the acquisition of relevant and significant skills for students. This study was designed from a qualitative approach, through the application of two-rounds of situated in-depth interviews to schools’ managers and professionals from mining companies from the north region of Chile. The findings illustrate the ways in which different efforts, contributions and formative actions provided by the companies are reshaping the educational processes inside the schools, establishing educational agendas that expect to provide more efficient alignments between the schools and the companies’ labor needs. Specifically, the paper argues that mining industry companies promote a reduced technical skills approach. This does not include long-term educational planning within the schools, and alternative technical, relational and transformational approaches to skills are absent. The former conventional notions of vocational education and training are being challenged by theoretical and empirical literature. A critical discussion on the skills agenda setting in VET systems is also presented. This study offers an original analytical review and an in-depth study on the dynamics and discourses that articulate and motivate the collaboration between VET schools and mining companies in the Chilean North."

Yet it is not clear if the SAS is sensitive to socio-cultural minorities and their particular conditions. Hence, in this article we explore the school choice experiences of parents from three socio-cultural minorities under the new SAS: Mapuche–indigenous families, Latin American migrant parents, and parents with children with disabilities. Using an intersectional theoretical approach and a qualitative research design, we show that while in some cases the implementation of SAS impedes previous discriminatory processes, in others this new system alone has not yet overcome long-established and inherent educational inequalities in Chilean education. Besides, SAS has also resulted in new challenges in the school choice processes of these parents. Their experiences with the SAS express the intersection of different axis of inequality, according to the conditions and historicities of each group of families. Finally, we reflect on the challenges that the policy faces in regard to develop an educational policy that is fairer to all families, in the context of the unequal and marketized Chilean educational system."

Nevertheless, current dominant discourses relate school libraries more closely to the demand to improve academic results. In this article, we explore what we consider to be an intensification of neoliberal discourses about school libraries by studying the case of the Learning Resource Centres (Centros de Recursos para el Aprendizaje, CRA) in Chile, a program that has been exemplary compared to other Latin American countries. With a Critical Policy Analysis (Bacchi 2009. Analysing Policy: What's the Problem Represented to be? Australia: Pearson, 2012. Engaging with Carol Bacchi. Strategic Interventions and Exchanges. Adelaide: University of Adelaide Press, 2015. ""The Turn to Problematization: Political Implications of Contrasting Interpretive and Poststructural Adaptations.""Open Journal of Political Science 5 (1): 1-12), we question the problems that the CRA produce and aim to solve and their transformations through time. We focus on four public policy documents tracing how school libraries are related to the global educational reforms of the late 1980s and the 1990s and how they are assessed in the 2010s. We read the documents sketching out three exclusions that, we argue, lay the foundation for a neoliberal intensification of the CRA program: the exclusions of pedagogical innovation, of other learning resources beyond books, and of the local community."

However, this is a complex task in a system where the quality of education is measured by standardized tests and schools are ranked. The objective of this article is to understand the tensions and limitations that school leaders face and overcome when implementing inclusion processes in a highly standardized educational system such as Chile’s. Through four case studies, 40 interviews and 18 focus groups were conducted with school leaders from four inclusive schools. The results show that (1) SIMCE stresses inclusion as a cultural process; (2) the standardization of the national curriculum affects the flexibility of teaching; (3) there are inclusive policies focused on and dependent on school performance; (4) school principals adopt discourses and practices typical of a management style beyond their leadership style. The findings support the account of an inclusion with excellence, i.e., an inclusive school model that emphasizes academic outcomes."

Parental responsibility and education policy in Chile and Australia | KEYWORDS: education policy; ethics; neoliberalism; parents; policy sociology; responsibility | ABSTRACT: This article questions the diverse and, in some cases, contradictory ethical forms present in contemporary neoliberal policy frames. In particular, we analyse the demands of responsibility – as a form of ethical commitment – requested of parents by education policies in the contexts of Chile and Australia. Assuming neoliberalism as a contextualised and multivocal form of governing, we applied a policy sociology approach to study the ethical implications for parents of two recent educational reforms developed in the national contexts of this research. Our analyses show that the emerging demands on parents for responsibility in the educational field exceed univocal forms of individual responsibilisation, encompassing expressions of responsibility that respond to collective and public goals."

Using Gewirtz's multidimensional model of justice and the frame of socially just pedagogies, we analyse the case of Oscar, a father of a child with Down Syndrome, who is looking for a school for his son. The case develops in the Chilean educational system context, which is known by its neoliberal policy frame and its highly stratified structure. For this reason, a new inclusion law and, specifically, a new school admission system were implemented in 2015 and 2017 respectively, to generate a fairer and more equal school admission policy frame. Therefore, our theoretical proposi-tion has practical implications, in policy terms, and analytical ones. We propose to add two dimensions of educational justice at the time we analyse Oscar’s case: first, educational justice must embrace injustices that are not necessarily experienced in formal educational spaces; we call this the multi-spatiality dimension of justice. Second, we propose a multi-temporality analysis of educational justice, one that considers, as socially just pedagogies have established, a focus on the future. In this case the educational policy and discourse promotes a pre-established and normalised future for children, one that is problematic for children with disabilities, whose parents, like Oscar, have a more urgent focus on the present."

The study is based on qualitative research that includes a sample of 21 interviews with two subgroups: Mapuche families and Latin American immigrant parents. The findings allow us to identify the main background, criteria, concerns and expectations of immigrant and Mapuche families that participated in the study regarding the school choice for their sons and daughters, and show that ethnicity and culture intersect with the social class to produce unequal experiences in accessing the school system. Furthermore, the investigation sheds light on the different and variegated expressions of cultural and institutional racism and discrimination, as well as the main particularities that, considering their social and territorial contexts, experienced each sociocultural minority during school choice processes. To conclude, the article rescues the value of illuminating the experience of sociocultural minorities studied from critical theoretical approaches, to clarify the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in school systems."

While implementing this policy, in 2019, the former minister of education directed a populist campaign aiming to change policy directions coined the Just Admission Project (JAP). Such policy debates have critical implications regarding the functioning of school choice in Chile. This paper analyzes the JAP as a case study of reactionary neoliberal populism. Framed by such conceptualization of populism, this paper develops a statistical analysis to model the potential influence of the JAP bill on school choice opportunities while comparing with the recently implemented new assignment system from the Inclusion Law (NSAS). We show the results of simulations representing how students would have been assigned to schools for the 2019 school year had the admission procedure been the JAP instead of the NSAS."
1394,0,"TITLE: School admission in Chile, new rules of the game, and the devaluation of Middle-class capitals | KEYWORDS: middle-class families; School admission; school choice; value of capitals | ABSTRACT: This paper illustrates the influence of a new national assignment system (NSAS) on Chilean middle-class advantage. This system was designed to increase educational equity by changing the previous school admission “rules” that were prejudicial against low-income students. We use Bourdieu’s conceptual tools, drawing on concepts of capitals and field, to analyse the influence of the new rules of the game on the value of middle-class capitals. To understand how the new rules shape middle-class families’ advantages, we link qualitative and quantitative analyses that empirically explore how families subjectively interpret the policy change and how objectively it shapes their access to desired schools. The qualitative phase shows that middle-class parents experience the NSAS as a risky new scenario. However, quantitative analysis shows the NSAS is associated with only a modest decrease in middle class-advantages. We illustrate the difficulty of transforming marketized educational systems, where previously privileged families react against equity-driven changes."

Using a poststructural theoretical perspective, the qualitative study is focused on rural students’ subjectivities, through the analysis of their narratives about their lives, their perceptions on secondary schooling, and their educational/labour perspectives about the future. The findings reveal the tensions between the certainty and uncertainty of a future. Specifically, of an educational and work path by which students seek to continue or diverge from the paths taken by previous generations. Here, education policies fail to offer a real upgrade in their future educational and lived conditions or aspirations. Moreover, rural students respond to the neoliberal discourse in an active attempt to de-subjectivise themselves from historical trajectories of precariousness."

In this sense, we argue that the processes of classification (in terms of social class), racialisation and genderisation that migrant Latin families experience when choosing schools for their children in the Chilean context can be a form of this coloniality. To make our case, we use narratives from in-depth interviews conducted in Valparaíso with migrant families who applied to schools under the new admission system. In this sense, narratives show that the processes of classification, racialisation and genderisation, as socio-cultural productions, intersect with migrant families’ school-choice experiences. These intersections emerge when families match school choices with an shelter search, as they manifest their interests to protect their children, avoiding schools with ‘marginal children’ or racial bullying and safeguarding gender expectations."

The study is based in the rural settings of Chile, a country with an internationally recognized educational policy frame, as one of the pioneers in introducing radical market mechanisms, with large consequences for educational inequality and segregation. Based on a qualitative study developed between 2014 and 2017, and using a poststructural theoretical approach for the analysis, the chapter presents a critical review of the main discursive influences and features in relevant policy frames regarding rural development and rural education policies in Chile and beyond. Additionally, the chapter analyzes voices of academic and policy stakeholders’ close to rural education. Together these analyses provide a practical insight to the topic. Rural schooling is presented as an invisible educational reality under an unarticulated policy frame, producing dissimilar educational dynamics in such geographical settings. The absence of focalized educational policies to rural spaces generates diverse assemblages between educational and business institutions, in what can be called as an “intimate relationship” between schools and industrial companies of the zones, where schools, especially through their TVET curricular alternatives, try to fit their educational frames with the labor needs of the companies of the rural zones. This dynamic produces particular educational arrangements, which, concretely, forms particular educational paths for rural students. In those terms, these educational-economic assemblages have a productive power, as they, while influencing and conditioning students’ future educational and labor horizons, produce certain type of subjectivities, establishing the margins of what is possible in such social and institutional scenarios."

This article assesses current policies in Mexico and Brazil towards indigenous populations in higher education, considering the various responses to the challenge, including affirmative action programmes in mainstream universities, intercultural courses and autonomous institutions. These policies and initiatives are analysed using the theoretical frames of redistribution and recognition, focusing on demands for formal equality and material wellbeing on the one hand, and a distinctive cultural and educational space on the other. While state-sponsored policies focus primarily on the redistributive element, initiatives based on recognition come largely from autonomous organisations, raising a series of dilemmas and tensions around educational justice for indigenous populations in the region."
1399,24,"TITLE: Interruptions: imagining an analytical otherwise for disaster studies in Latin America | KEYWORDS: Chile; Disaster studies; Latin America; Local politics; Postcolonial theory; Vulnerability | ABSTRACT: Purpose: Based on the research, the authors identify how four key concepts in disaster studies—agency, local scale, memory and vulnerability—are interrupted, and how these interruptions offer new perspectives for doing disaster research from and for the South. Design/methodology/approach: Meta-analysis of case studies and revision of past and current collaborations of authors with communities across Chile. Findings: The findings suggest that agency, local scale, memory and vulnerability, as fundamental concepts for disaster risk reduction (DRR) theory and practice, need to allow for ambivalences, ironies, granularization and further materializations. The authors identify these characteristics as the conditions that emerge when doing disaster research from within the disaster itself, perhaps the critical condition of what is usually known as the South. Originality/value: The authors contribute to a reflexive assessment of fundamental concepts for critical disaster studies. The authors offer research-based and empirically rich redefinitions of these concepts. The authors also offer a novel understanding of the political and epistemological conditions of the “South” as both a geography and a project."

The current governance model has not proven successful in disaster risk reduction. This article aims to theoretically analyse the relationship between ideal regional disaster risk governance (DRG) and the actual production of disaster risk in Latin America. From the so-called ‘vulnerability paradigm’ and a regional standpoint, this analysis contributes to the debate with a specific focus on ‘neo-extractivism.’ Pointing mainly to sociopolitical processes triggered as of the early 2000s in Latin America, ‘neo-extractivism’ relates to a regional ecological-political pattern of intensive natural resource exploitation. The first part of this article presents a regional overview of DRG and its scope in disaster risk reduction, analysing its ineffectiveness through the lens of the neoliberal governmentality problem. The second part deals with the issue of ‘neo-extractivism’ to outline the actual links between the political arena, the development discourse, and the creation of vulnerability and new hazards in the region’s contemporary social processes. We show a correlation between political arrangements and environmental degradation that brings about both disasters and an increase in disaster risk. ‘Neo-extractivism’ foregrounds the political conditions for the implementation of regional DRG and reveals how its projections within the development discourse relate incongruously with the essential factors of disaster risk."

Starting with an interdisciplinary approach to the phenomenon of forced migration, to the situation of the Mapuche in the city, and to the return of the ""Indigenous Question"" during the nineties in Latin America, it interrogates the structural framework these urban process were based on. Thus, it identifies the ""necessary"" conjunction between the constitutive violence of the Chilean nation-state sovereign with the ever-increasing advancement of the pattern of capital accumulation. From there, it argues that it is possible to be observed in the conditions of irruption of these urban indigenous processes, tensions of the continual renovation of the mentioned link that operates as a matrix of territorialization, ""othering"", and dispossession.

Based on the expectancy-value motivational theory, this paper analyzes the effect of motivational components (expectancy, utility, attainment, cost, and interest) on the performance of critical thinking skills, and estimates the predictive capacity of these factors on critical thinking skills. In this study, three instruments were applied to a sample of 254 Spanish university students: the Motivation for Critical Thinking Scale (EMPC) and two scales of critical thinking skills: PENCRISAL and CCTST. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the motivational components that best explain the performance of these skills. The results show that, regardless of the critical thinking test used, the motivational variables explain the variance in the performance of critical thinking skills ranging from 8% to 17%. Finally, the importance of considering these components of motivation to promote performance in these critical thinking skills is discussed."

In the educational field, many countries have implemented teleworking and tele-education, which has generated stressful situations and work overload due to the transfer and modification of traditional tasks. This study analyzes the mental health conditions and the perception of mental workload in 311 civil officials, teachers and non-teachers, from 9 Chilean establishments, 246 women and 65 men. Two instruments were applied, the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS 21) and the Subjective Mental Workload Scale (ESCAM), analyzing the data in a descriptive and correlational way. The results show, regarding mental health, average levels in stress, as well as low in depression and anxiety; while in mental workload a moderately high perception is observed in the dimensions of cognitive demand, characteristics of the task and organization of time, while a medium perception is observed in the dimensions of work rhythm and consequences for health; furthermore, positive, significant and moderately high correlations were found between the health consequences dimension of the mental workload scale and the dimensions of stress, depression and anxiety; in addition to significant differences between groups according to gender and work carried out. It is concluded that the mandatory modifications due to the pandemic have affected officials in their mental health and the perception of the burden of their activities, increasing negative stress."

Critical thinking is a highly-valued skill in higher education, even though there are few studies that demonstrate its effectiveness on scientific skills of pedagogy stu-dents. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of a critical thinking program (PENCRIT-RC) on inquiry and probabilistic reasoning skills in pedagogy students. Method. The method was based on a quasi-experimental design, with a control group and pre and post-test application. The participants were 95 students of science and mathematics pedagogy from two Chilean universities. The instruments used were an inquiry scale adapted from a critical thinking test, and a scale of probabilistic reasoning adapted from the Lawson classroom test. Descriptive and bivariated analisys (ancova) was applied to calculate data. Results. The results showed a statistically significant difference in both variables for the ex-perimental group, with a large effect in the inquiry variable, and a moderate effect in the probabilistic reasoning variable. Discussion and Conclusion. It is concluded that the program is effective for the develop-ment of inquiry skills in participants, but probabilistic reasoning skills require more work in professional training"

An adaptation of a personal development program created in Spain for use in the Chilean educational context is proposed and submitted for evaluation. The idea is to provide a concrete proposal that strengthens one of the thematic axes proposed in Chile as part of adolescents’personal development and evaluate it to determine its effectiveness. Methodology. The research design corresponds to a quasi-experimental line with pre- and post-test and control groups, calculating t-tests to determine the existence of statistical differences between the results of the initial and final evaluation of self-concept, emotional intelligence, anxiety, and self-efficacy. These constructs were measured with the Self-Description Questionnaire II, short version (SDQII-S), the Trait Meta-Mood Scale 24 (TMMS-24), the State and Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI-S), and the General Self-Efficacy Questionnaire. The sample included 182 high school students from the commune of Chillán, 88 males and 94 females (48% and 52%, respectively), aged between 14 and 17 years (M=15; SD; 1.01), who were selected by convenience, according to the criterion of accessibility. Results. The results indicate that the program shows statistically significant improvements of small and moderate magnitude in the experimental group. Conclusion. For the same reason, it can be reported that the program was positively evaluated using a satisfaction survey, so it is estimated that this proposal has been able to respond to the training needs of the Chilean educational system."

The participants were 1195 Chilean students between the ages of 10 and 17 years old (M = 12.5; D.E. = 1.38); the instrument used was the child-adolescent perfectionism scale (CAPS). The dimensionality, reliability, and frequency ranges of the test were analyzed in the sample. The results give an account of three dimensions, with a high general reliability level of .89, according Cronbach's alpha; and an adequate level in its dimensions, alpha values between .722 and .794. It is also observed in the sample that the effort-oriented perfectionism (EOP) is the characteristic with the highest score, while the socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP) characteristic the lowest. It is concluded that the instrument has adequate psychometric characteristics, and that the socially prescribed perfectionism, a negative feature of the phenomenon, according to what is observed, is less developed in the participating group, which would strengthen socio-emotional development."

The study aimed to know conceptions and types of intervention programs in critical thinking used in teacher training in Ibero-America. The methodology was divided in two stages: first, bibliographic review that found 21 articles related to terms ""critical thinking"", ""intervention"", and ""pedagogy"", second, a selection of articles related to Spain and Latin American experiences, having 7 articles according to this parameters, in addition to content analysis was used to analyze definitions of critical thinking used by studies. Results reveals firstly that critical thinking is firstly a broad defined concept; secondly, there is a diversity of characteristics in relation to duration of applied programs and methodologies, and finally, programs reviewed in this study have a positive impact on students. It's discussed that critical thinking is a necessary skill for an effective professional performance, but misunderstanding and poorly accepted, although it improves the teacher strategies for analyzes their actions and decisions making process, and it is not valued in positive way in educational system. The experiences of its promotion in pedagogy in Latin America are less compared to those developed in Europe, USA and the Middle East, as well as, other areas of knowledge such health professions or science."

1414,3,"TITLE: An analysis of bus drivers’ interactions with motorists | KEYWORDS: Bus drivers; Conflicts; Driving behaviour; Latin America; Reactions | ABSTRACT: Driving a bus in the city is a task that demands attention to changing road conditions while dealing with passengers’ needs. Bus drivers often experience aggression from passengers and other road users, which sometimes escalate, eventually leading to violence. However, many road conflicts are rarely reported and, hence, difficult to study. This article analyses bus drivers’ reactions to conflicts with other motorists in Santiago (Chile), where public transport accounts for 35% of the total trips. Four percent of the population of bus drivers (639) responded to a survey with questions about job satisfaction, the bus route, and experiences of conflicts and accidents with other vehicles. A Mixed Logit model was estimated to explore bus drivers’ reactions to a conflict with motorised vehicles. The results show that bus driver's most frequent reaction is ignoring and carrying on. If a conflict escalates, bus drivers display aggressive reactions such as violently blowing the horn, insult louder, chucking the bus onto the other vehicle, overtake the vehicle off, or start a fist fight. Being a bus driver with no previous experience of violence with other public transport buses decreases the likelihood of violent reactions, while the opposite occurs with young drivers. Interestingly, the chances of having violent response increase when the driver was female. Public policies should start paying attention to the series of minor conflicts endured by bus drivers in their routines. These conflicts often are not reported to the authorities but nonetheless, exacerbate the chronic stress that bus drivers experience."

It seeks to contribute to studies that suggest that the built environment is highly symbolic, collaborate with the growing number of works that are addressing the everyday lives of vulnerable groups, and enrich Latin American literature about public spaces. The article reports a qualitative and quantitative analysis of forty-two interviews with residents of deprived neighbourhoods in Santiago in which they were invited to converse about the characteristics of public spaces and the activities that take place in them. The results suggest that housing proximity and the quality of public spaces influence social, recreational, and physical activities. Contestation activities are related to the distance that separates people’s houses and the public space. Meanwhile, illicit activities feature diverse patterns and, according to the participants, tend to occupy the public space in low-income neighbourhoods. The findings also suggest that the precariousness of the houses is considered as a factor that contributes to the vitality of the streets; the quality of the public space is seen as a form of inequality, whereas the State is considered as an absent agent that has little interest in the wellbeing of those who live in the most deprived areas of the city."

This article explores how the built environment affects older persons’ walking experiences, by analysing older persons’ self-reported emotional responses to the built environment. More in detail, this article examines the findings of a set of walking interviews in which forty older persons (between 60 and 79 years old) who resided in central areas of Santiago de Chile were invited to walk in their neighbourhoods and talk about the features of the built environment that affect the journeys they complete on foot and the emotions they elicit. The analysis shows that the built environment is an emotional issue for the participants, which has a significant impact on their well-being and everyday life. The older persons declared that while walking certain features of the built environment can elicit wellness (e.g., greenery) and unwellness (e.g., narrow sidewalks), stress (e.g., crossings), and resignation (e.g., motorized traffic), among other emotions. Finally, the article reflects upon how urban planning and design can make substantial contributions in improving the built environment to enhance older adults’ walking experiences."

In this context, a key challenge of urban and architectural design is promoting built environments that are friendly for old age. In general, research on built environments and old age has tended to focus on neighborhood public spaces and the accessibility of homes and residences for older adults, paying little attention to the common spaces of collective housing, which can be important places for the daily activities of older people. In this framework, this research aims to analyze the extent to which regulatory and indicative instruments in Chile consider older people in the design of collective housing common spaces. 3 treaties and conventions, 10 regulatory instruments, and 7 indicative instruments were reviewed for this, using the qualitative analysis software atlas.ti. The results show that common spaces are not conceived for purposes beyond people's circulation in the regulatory instruments. These are spaces that must be obstacle-free and whose features do not involve daily practices that entail social interaction or remaining in these. The analysis also shows that older people are absent from regulatory instruments. On the other hand, indicative instruments recognize and look to safeguard their rights and diversity. Finally, the findings indicate that efforts are needed so that the requirements of older people, which have been included in indicative instruments, are also integrated into regulatory instruments. This would promote active aging and allow older people to remain in their homes and neighborhoods."
1419,3,"TITLE: Bus drivers and their interactions with cyclists: An analysis of minor conflicts | KEYWORDS: Bus drivers; Cyclists; Latin America; Perception; Road behaviour | ABSTRACT: Driving a bus in a city is a challenging task as it demands paying attention to changing conditions (e.g., weather, congestion) while interacting with passengers and other road users who sometimes display unpredictable behaviours. Cyclists play an important role in these interactions. This paper investigates how cyclists are perceived by bus drivers and how conflicts arising from their daily interactions shape the attitudes of bus drivers. A total of 639 bus drivers (4% of the workforce, 91% males) working in Santiago de Chile responded an online survey. The survey asked drivers about their perception of other transport modes, their experience with traffic collisions and the conflicts they have had with cyclists. Later, logistic regression models were estimated, using “coexistence with cyclists” as the dependent variable. The findings show that younger and older drivers have a better perception of cyclists compared to middle-aged ones. Negative experiences with cyclists worsen the perception of co-existence with cyclists; meanwhile, previous cycling experience was unrelated to drivers’ perceptions. The results also suggest that existing norms are perceived as ineffective. Finally, gender was not statistically significant in shaping bus drivers’ perception of cyclists, yet this topic requires further attention as the composition of the public transport labour force is changing."
1420,3,"TITLE: Understanding cyclists’ conflicts in the streets of a Latin American metropolis | KEYWORDS: Auto-centric culture; Conflicts; Cycling; Qualitative data; Santiago | ABSTRACT: Promoted by most governments as a sustainable form of transportation, cycling is surging worldwide. Despite the positive impacts of cycling, conflicts between cyclists and other street users such as pedestrians, cars and buses have increased, especially in countries lacking proper cycling infrastructure. This paper aims to understand a series of conflicts experienced by cyclists in Santiago de Chile, where cycling has expanded rapidly in the last fifteen years. To do so, three focus groups were held with cyclists having different levels of experience. The participants were asked to describe the main conflicts with other modes of transport and road users, as well as the coping strategies employed to deal with these conflicts. An inductive analysis ended with four categories related to cyclists’ conflicts in the streets and two related to strategies and lessons dealing with motorised vehicle drivers and other cyclists. The analysis indicates that the unequal distribution of road space negatively influences cyclists’ experiences, who perceive themselves as being threatened constantly by overtaking cars in close proximity, as well as by different forms of verbal and sometimes physical aggression. It indicates that cyclists develop strategies to mitigate conflicts, ranging from making themselves visible at all times, to making use of bodily gestures. However, conflicts can still escalate. The results suggest that, in auto-centric urban contexts, cycling is a challenging chore that happens surrounded by the sensation of having fragile entitlements."

The new uses assigned to neighborhoods and homes brought to the fore, on the one hand, pre-pandemic socio-spatial inequalities and, on the other hand, the peculiarities specific to neighbourhoods and homes within the broader urban canvas, especially with respect to equipment, accessibility and identity. Using data from an EPDUS survey conducted before and after the COVID-19 crisis, this work describes the socio-territorial conditions, changes in spatial uses and practices, the role of social ties and the role of the neighborhood as a scale of containment and mutual support before the pandemic. The conclusion shows us that different neighborhood typologies in the metropolitan area of Santiago configure unequal spaces that determine the possibility of building social bonds of support, collaboration and care in crises such as the one triggered by the COVID-19."

However, little is known about how such attributes influence those who walk in socio-economically deprived neighborhoods. The article explores how the social sphere and the built environment influence walking in deprived neighborhoods. To do so, it reports the findings of a qualitative research carried out in four neighborhoods of Santiago de Chile that are experiencing a sharp decline in their socio-spatial structures. The findings indicate that aspects of the social sphere (social networks, ties) influence people’s perception of insecurity, their willingness to complete trips with social purposes, the extension of the territories considered “walkable”, and the feeling of loneliness that accompanies many of the walks that take place in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The attributes of the built environment mirror the social sphere, influence the experience of walking, are cues for risks that shape people’s behavior, and collaborate in the delineation of what is considered “normal.” The analysis showed that walking is at risk in Santiago’s deprived neighborhoods; a complex activity that should be protected by means of multidimensional strategies that simultaneously address the social sphere and the built environment."

This article aims to understand the factors that encourage or discourage older people’s walking behaviors, as well as the policies influencing those factors in Chile. It does so by reporting the analysis of twenty-five semi-structured interviews with Chilean policymakers and local leaders. The experts consistently represented walking as a beneficial activity for older persons that, nonetheless, occurs in adverse built environments.

1425,6,"TITLE: Walking through deprived neighbourhoods: Meanings and constructions behind the attributes of the built environment | KEYWORDS: Deprived built environments; Deterioration; Public space; Territorialities; Walking; Walking interviews | ABSTRACT: Existing research on relations between the built environment and walking has mostly focused on people's propensity to walk through a given area. Little work has investigated how people's experience of walking is mediated by their reading of how elements of the built environment confer social indications such as safety or threat, territoriality or community. Still less research has focused on walking through deprived areas. The research reported here begins to redress this absence by exploring how and why aspects of the built environment influence the experience of walking by those who live in disadvantaged neighbourhoods of Santiago de Chile. Mixed qualitative methods, including mobile interviews with residents, researcher observation and mapping were used to explore experiences of walking in three housing estates in Santiago. The findings reveal that residents’ perceptions of safety or danger are shaped by the presence of deterioration of buildings and public space, territorial demarcations, the features of the borders of public space and the urban form. Those features are used to identify risks, are signified through personal experiences, knowledge and social constructions and induce changes on pedestrian trips that can be slight, by altering attitudes towards certain places, or profound, by involving adjustments on everyday routes."
1426,3,"TITLE: Creating inequality in accessibility: The relationships between public transport and social housing policy in deprived areas of Santiago de Chile | KEYWORDS: Deprivation; Housing policy; Public transport; Time | ABSTRACT: This paper identifies the very limited connectivity provided by the current public transport system to the most deprived groups of Santiago de Chile, and explores the territorial aspects of transport and social housing policies that have contributed to the creation of unequal public transport schemes. To achieve those aims, we present a review of public policies in Chile and the results of an original quantitative analysis that measures the travel times required to access the opportunities and activities located in the city. The results show that housing policies put people at a disadvantage by increasing the distance between them and the opportunities of the city. Three decades after the implementation of housing policies, transport still fails to mitigate these distances and instead of alleviating the patterns of segregation, it may have reinforced them. The travel times required increase towards the periphery (even though densities do not decrease) and are higher than the averages of the city in social housing estates."
1427,3,"TITLE: Towards a sustainable city: Applying urban renewal incentives according to the social and urban characteristics of the area | KEYWORDS: Densification; Metro stations; Public policy; Santiago; Social integration | ABSTRACT: The construction of new urban transport infrastructure transforms the accessibility patterns of the immediate areas, modifying people's movements and, with that, the demand for land, its uses, activities and densities. In the case of the Chilean capital, Santiago, the underground (Metro), has generated sub-centralities, densification and potentiated real estate development in certain parts of the city, but has had negligible effects in others. Our research aims at trying to enhance the positive effects of a mass transit network such as Metro, to improve two large malaises of the city: its increasing urban sprawl and its unacceptable social segregation. Both problems are not unique to Santiago, but are shared by many Latin American conurbations. To do so, we first analysed and classified the areas around Metro stations, based on their social and urban characteristics, and densification potential. We then identified existing and potential subsidies to promote social integration and densification and, finally, we applied a stated choice experiment to real estate developers to inquire into their willingness to build in the vicinity of selected GIS-classified stations. In a previous paper, we discussed the models estimated with the stated choice data, and the expected results of applying packages of incentives for densification in the vicinity of different Metro stations. In this paper, we seek to identify mechanisms to increase both housing density and, at the same time, promote social integration in the vicinity of Metro stations, by identifying a typology of urban areas that respond differently to such incentives. Our results show that the effectiveness of the various incentives depends, to a great extent, on the urban characteristics of the Metro station surroundings. For example, in stations located in the central areas of the city incentives to stimulate real estate activity are not really necessary, as the process is well underway; however, in Metro stations located in industrial areas incentives are more effective in triggering real estate dynamics, especially direct demand incentives for any buyer or with a limited time frame. Finally, in peripheral Metro stations located in low standard social housing areas, the incentives tend to be less effective and are probably not enough to trigger a significant densification or integration process; hence, probably other type of governmental action, such as pilot or demonstration projects, should be sought for these cases."

In this context, neighbourhoods have a double function that gathers community values while operates as link between the homes and the metropolis. The neighbourhood's role in the building of the community is especially relevant in vulnerable neighbourhoods. In Chile, after years of housing public policies that privileged the construction of houses, the focus has changed towards neighbourhood improvement with multi-sectorial integral interventions. In this context, the objective of the present paper is to evaluate the relationship between the physical space and the sociability structures of inhabitants from vulnerable neighbourhoods in the process of consolidation in Santiago de Chile, through the analysis of two cases in the municipality of El Bosque. The general hypothesis is that the physic space and the configuration of many vulnerable neighbourhoods, work as a structure-that-structures social relation, capable of inhibiting sociability and favouring urban isolation."

This limitation is translated into a different mobility, which is enclosed and vulnerable to diverse phenomena such as residential location and quality of public space. In the case of Santiago, Chile, there are considerable mobility differences depending on gender, age and income; emphasizing the higher fragility of low income groups that inhabit the neighborhoods created by the State during the second half of the past century. Through quantitative indicators and qualitative tools, the present paper aims to characterize three scales of women's mobility in Santiago: metropolitan, neighborhood, and local. The evidence shows disparities at all the levels: in the metropolitan scale, high income women perform a high number of trips, and most of them are motorized; on the other hand, pedestrian trips are predominant in the low income groups. In a smaller scale, in the neighborhoods, pedestrian trips are strongly affected by social and environmental factors such as security perception."

To overcome these problems, people display strategies which allow them to maximize their times; taking advantage of their personal capabilities and the opportunities offered by the spaces that they must cover. The present paper has the objective to portray people's daily mobility practices of a mixed used land space in the city of Santiago de Chile (Plaza de Mai-pú), considering the problems which came from social constructions and the family. To achieve the objective, the paper analyzes experiences from inhabitants of Plaza de Maipú's surroundings which shows how the same space can have different meanings and functions."

In the case of Santiago de Chile, the complicated implementation of a new public transport system in 2007 (Transantiago) implied the elaboration of several projects to adjust the traditional street structure to the needs of the new rapid transit bus system (BRT). However, all of the proposals triggered social disputes which ended with the same result: the imposition of social demands over Central State needs. This paper aims to characterize those conflicts, identifying the actors involved, their arguments and their evolution through time. It concludes with the multiple meanings that people assign to streets and Central State incapability to communicate its ideas and objectives."

Despite the relevance of these platforms as communicative tools to support online learning, we cannot neglect the impact of the human connection if we want to ensure an equitable learning environment for online asynchronous students. Mathematics online education has lacked research on how an instructional team can use an instructional platform to promote participation and enhance students’ performance. In our study, we used a descriptive-correlational research design to explore this connection in the context of an online asynchronous math course across eight semesters. Our findings showed that the combination of these technological and human resources (Microsoft Teams and an instructional team) improved student participation and performance in our online asynchronous course. While each group of students (online campus and main campus) saw improvements in participation and performance, online campus students saw greater improvement. We hope our findings inform online math teaching to improve students’ learning experience and provide new research opportunities to study the reasons behind them."

These explanations serve to clarify concepts, procedures, facts, ideas, or types of problems, and are aimed at promoting student understanding. The low performance of Chilean science teachers on explanations has led us to incorporate instances in chemistry teachers education specifically aimed at developing the necessary skills to construct subject-adequate science teaching explanations. The objective of this research was to characterize the transference of the components of preservice teachers’ subject-adequate science teaching explanations across different chemistry topics. Through a qualitative methodology with an exploratory case study approach, we analyzed a total of 112 scientific explanations constructed by 28 chemistry preservice teachers throughout a 4-month training process. Our results show that, for the analyzed sample, the formulation of subject-adequate science teaching explanations involve different components whose development has distinctive characteristics. The criteria associated with the form of the explanations, which depend on teachers’ discursive knowledge, can be developed in teachers’ education through recursive strategies for the formulation of science teaching explanations across different chemistry topics. The criteria associated with the function of the explanations, which depend on teachers’ content knowledge, require other strategies besides the disciplinary courses and recursive strategies for the formulation of science teaching explanations, to get teachers to formulate subject-adequate science teaching explanations across different chemistry topics. The work developed can provide instructional and evaluative strategies for science teachers’ education, oriented to one of the teaching core practices that requires our attention as teacher trainers."

In order to design courses that create and develop pedagogical content knowledge in the training of specialist teachers, it was necessary to agree on a vision of what kind of knowledge this is and how it can be promoted, as well as, to identify the main chemical knowledge for teaching in secondary education, to propose a development sequence for initial training, and to implement specific strategies to elicit this professional knowledge. This paper presents the results of the discussions that have been developed as a team, an example of the proposed activities and the productions of our teachers in training."

Based on this, we raise the hypothesis that the Chilean government would perform such discursive representation in two main stages: The first stage emerges from the various river expeditions and the information they provide since the beginning of the republican era and until the late nineteenth century; and the second stage is marked by the construction and expansion of a discursive representation on Aysén which is implicit in the state's actions and dictums. It can be said that the meaning given to Aysén -and the features assigned to it (usually negative) - become a historical constant."

We thoroughly investigate two innovative methodologies, each tailored to meet distinct operational goals in a USAR setting. The first employs a belief propagation framework that is designed to provide prompt and robust initial damage assessments using sparse data, with the capability to incorporate additional on-site information as it becomes available. The second methodology introduces a modified graph convolutional network to quantify the uncertainty levels inherent in damage classification tasks. Three case studies were considered, using damage assessment data from the 2020 Beirut explosion, the 2021 Haiti earthquake and the 2023 Türkiye-Syria earthquake. Our experimental results demonstrate the potential of these approaches to achieve operational objectives, particularly in terms of robustness and scalability in disaster scenarios. The versatility offered by graph-based methodologies establishes a solid foundation for addressing these dynamic challenges, suggesting a promising direction for continued research in this field."

On the other hand, self-regulated learning management (SRLM) allows students to consciously seek strategies for learning, self-motivated, and have confidence in their abilities as learners, facilitating active problems solving, generating alternatives, and anticipating responses. Objective: The purpose of this research was to analyze the relationship between executive functions, self-regulated learning management, and academic performance in first-year university in the health sciences and medicine field. Method: A quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional approach was used, based on a sample of 101 students aged between 17 and 27 years (M=18.71, SD=1.18), where 64 were female (63.4%) and 37 were male (36.6%). Of the total, 51 were medical students and 50 were chemistry and pharmacy students. Academic performance was used as the dependent variable and SF and GAAR as independent variables, and the objective was analyzed using Spearman correlations and the Kruskall-Wallis test. Results: The results show a significant relationship between EF and SRLM, as well as between monitoring, cognitive flexibility, and planning EF with academic performance. Conclusions: A good development of skills related to the variables studied is demonstrated. In the case of SRLM and academic performance, a significant relationship was evidenced in the dimensions of self-management of learning and perception of academic performance. It is considered relevant to further investigate the relationship between FE and SRLM, as well as these variables with the AP, and to consider these results in the support plans generated for first-year university students."

There is a positive and a statistically significant relationship between cold executive functions (cEFs) and self-regulated learning management (SRLM). This research is a quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, and inferential study, with a correlational approach. The sample was non-probabilistic, by convenience sampling, composed of n = 379 college students belonging to pedagogy careers, 64.1% were males, and 35.9% females, aged between 17 and 34 years old (M = 19.82, SD = 2.41). The results show that there is a strong association between cold executive functions and self-regulated learning management since high performance in cEFs would imply a high performance on learning management. On the other hand, it is also observed a predictive value of planning cEF on SRLM, meaning that, an optimal level of planning would imply adequate management of learning processes. The original contribution of this study is to provide evidence to consider supporting plans for college students to improve their skills in the cEFs, due to the negative impact that failure in higher education represents for the student, their families, and university system. Finally, we think it is necessary to continue the research in depth of these variables, and their influence in higher education academic performance."
1442,0,"TITLE: The role of executive functions in academic performance and behaviour of university students | KEYWORDS: Academic performance; Attention deficit; Executive functions; Impulsivity; University students | ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is fourfold: first, to analyse the relationship between executive functions and academic performance; second, to identify the level of prediction executive functions have on academic performance; third, to determine the correlation between executive functions and academic performance; and fourth, to compare executive functions based on the level of academic performance. Design/methodology/approach: The sample composed of 175 university students aged between 18 and 36 years (M=21.49, SD=3.22). The EFECO scale, the average student grade and a scale based on the diagnostic criteria for ADHD were used as measurement instruments. Findings: Difficulties in executive functions: Difficulties in working memory (r=−0.30, p=<0.01) and difficulties in conscious supervision of behaviour (r=−0.29, p⩽0.01) have an inversely proportional relationship to academic performance (the greater the deficit of executive functions, the lower the academic performance). The regression analysis showed that executive functions explain 31 per cent of the variance of academic performance (χ2(25)=43.81, p <0.001). The study found that there is a relationship between all the executive functions and students’ behaviour in a medium to large magnitude. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of this study was the size of the sample as it is not representative of the country. Nevertheless, the correlation among the variables studied here has the necessary magnitude for the proposed correlations to be found. Nonetheless, it is necessary that we perform a study with a larger number of participants in order to achieve adequate extrapolation of the results. Practical implications: Data found in this study suggest that low academic performance of university students is related to a lower functionality of their executive functions. Originality/value: The originality of the research lies in relating specific concepts of neuropsychology to explain the academic performance of university students. The research findings allow us to project new studies to improve the executive functions for the benefit of the university student."

We screened 2nd-grade students (N = 84) with a standardized Spanish vocabulary measure. We then randomly assigned students who scored below the 40th percentile (n = 30) to an intervention or control group. The intervention group received small-group vocabulary instruction 3 times per week. The comparison group received instruction on the same words from the teacher in the whole group. Results indicated significant large effects of the intervention on student vocabulary knowledge of taught words at posttest (g = 1.60) and 4 months later (g = 0.92). Effects were nonsignificant, though moderate, for reading comprehension (g = 0.50). Students in the intervention group were able to articulate significantly more complex sentences using the target words than students in the comparison group. We discuss implications for practice."

The study aimed to know conceptions and types of intervention programs in critical thinking used in teacher training in Ibero-America. The methodology was divided in two stages: first, bibliographic review that found 21 articles related to terms ""critical thinking"", ""intervention"", and ""pedagogy"", second, a selection of articles related to Spain and Latin American experiences, having 7 articles according to this parameters, in addition to content analysis was used to analyze definitions of critical thinking used by studies. Results reveals firstly that critical thinking is firstly a broad defined concept; secondly, there is a diversity of characteristics in relation to duration of applied programs and methodologies, and finally, programs reviewed in this study have a positive impact on students. It's discussed that critical thinking is a necessary skill for an effective professional performance, but misunderstanding and poorly accepted, although it improves the teacher strategies for analyzes their actions and decisions making process, and it is not valued in positive way in educational system. The experiences of its promotion in pedagogy in Latin America are less compared to those developed in Europe, USA and the Middle East, as well as, other areas of knowledge such health professions or science."

The sample was made up of 446 education professionals, grouped into managers, classroom teachers, and professionals in counseling for children and youth with special educational needs. The method implemented was non-experimental, for descriptive purposes, transactional, and a questionnaire was used as instrument for collecting information. The analysis of the information was done through frequency tables. As a conclusion, it can be said that educational agents have a favorable perception in relation to the attention to diversity; the concept of diversity is seen as an enriching element that allows flexibility of the curriculum, the interdisciplinary work, adjustment of the curricular requirements to the needs of students to generate learning opportunities for all students."

In theory, these factors - individually and jointly - contribute to migration. This article builds on a rich body of knowledge and revisits the individual-level correlates of emigration intentions in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. I employ a comprehensive dataset spanning over a decade of AmericasBarometer surveys by the Latin American Public Opinion Project from 2006 to 2018-19. The empirical results, which rely on probit maximum likelihood estimators, sketch a statistical outline of the correlates of emigration intentions and reveal to what extent they have changed over time. The statistical analysis confirms that multiple factors correlate to emigration intentions. But a closer look reveals that two variables are more consistent over time and across countries: receiving remittances and crime victimization."
1447,7,"TITLE: Exploring the edges of clientelism: ideology, ethnicity, and partisanship in Belize | KEYWORDS: Belize; Ethnicity; ideology; Latin America; party systems; political parties | ABSTRACT: Studies focusing on Belize reveal that clientelism is the glue that makes the party system stick. We explore whether ideology and ethnicity account for partisanship within that deeply clientelist setting. We use four AmericasBarometer survey waves by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) to study the individual-level correlates of partisan attachments with the People’s United Party (PUP) and United Democratic Party (UDP). Using binary and multinomial probit maximum likelihood estimators, we find that ethnicity correlates to partisanship with the PUP, and ideology correlates to partisanship with the UDP. The robustness checks, which focus on declared vote choices in previous national elections, corroborate our findings. The Belizean case shows how clientelist parties can develop alternative support sources and that these can vary substantially."
1448,7,"TITLE: Bankers and Sheriffs? The Economy, Public Security, and Vote Intention for Presidential Incumbents in Central America | KEYWORDS: crime; Economic vote; insecurity; Latin America; voting | ABSTRACT: Students of Latin American politics have identified the economy and public security as relevant determinants of voting behaviour. This article extends those insights to Central America. We use a decade of AmericasBarometer data from 2008 to 2018 to study whether voters in six Central American countries prioritise economic or public security issues when casting votes for the incumbent candidate or party. The results reveal that positive economic perceptions–retrospective national outlook in particular–help explain rewarding incumbents. In turn, the perception of insecurity, more than crime victimisation, is related to punishing incumbents. Therefore, the evidence suggests Central Americans behave like bankers and sheriffs when casting votes, although economic views weigh more than public security perceptions. The results indicate strikingly similar accountability patterns across countries."
1449,9,"TITLE: Explaining the Impact of South-South Migration: Evidence from Chile’s Immigration Boom | KEYWORDS: Chile; Fiscal burden; Latin America; Migration; Skill level; Xenophobia | ABSTRACT: Studies have extensively documented the effect of immigration on anti-immigration attitudes in high-income democracies. However, comparative political research has devoted less attention to South-South migration. We examine the impact of immigration on attitudes toward immigrants in Chile, which has experienced a threefold increase in its foreign-born population in the last decade. Using an instrumental variable design, we find that exposure to immigration increases hostile attitudes toward immigrants. Regarding the underlying factors driving hostile attitudes toward foreign-born groups, we find robust evidence pointing to immigration creating a public service shortage, which could explain the observed hostility. Conversely, we do not report evidence backing cultural anxieties or labor market competition. Hence, the Chilean case points to anti-immigrant attitudes gaining ground in contexts where welfare state provisions are limited and often precarious."
1450,7,"TITLE: Backsliding by Elite Collusion: Authoritarianism and Democratic Resurgence in Guatemala | KEYWORDS: authoritarianism; democracy; democratic backsliding; democratic erosion; Guatemala; Latin America | ABSTRACT: Guatemala is a case study in democratic backsliding led not by an aggrandized executive, but by a coalition of elites who collude to maximize and protect their collective power. Beginning in the mid-2010s, a decentralized but deeply entrenched network of elites dismantled democracy when anticorruption efforts threatened their common interests. The 2023 election was widely expected to consolidate this authoritarian turn but, instead, delivered an unexpected democratic resurgence when a moderate anticorruption reformer secured a shocking victory and then successfully resisted a “slow-motion coup” aimed at preventing the transfer of power. The Guatemalan case suggests that, under elite collusion, elites can be more prone to splits and strategic errors than in other authoritarian settings. These missteps provide unexpected opportunities to reverse backsliding, but democrats must be prepared to capitalize on regime errors and repel authoritarian counteroffensives by building broad coalitions that work simultaneously across multiple arenas of democratic contestation."
1451,7,"TITLE: Mirroring societal shifts: revisiting the ethno-racial, ethno-religious, and ideological foundations of Guyana’s party system | KEYWORDS: Caribbean; cleavages; ethnicity; Latin America; Partisanship; religion | ABSTRACT: While scholars have relied on societal cleavages to explain the origins and evolution of party systems in Western democracies, drawing that link in Latin America and the Caribbean has been more challenging. Guyana is an exception to the norm. Its party system has aligned ethnically since independence in the 1960s. The People’s National Congress mostly appeals to the Afro-Guyanese, and the People’s Progressive Party largely draws support from the Indo-Guyanese. However, in recent decades, the country has experienced relevant demographic shifts that force a reconsideration of the predominance of ethno-racial traits as fuelling inter-party competition. We use the AmericasBarometer to examine the individual-level ethno-racial, ethno-religious, and ideological correlates of partisanship from 2010 to 2016. The results indicate that ethno-racial divisions have lost salience as ethno-religious features have become a more prevalent source of partisan attachments. We conclude that the correlates of partisanship in Guyana mirror its broader socio-demographic transformation."

This article explores how the determinants of partisanship identified in the literature navigate in Central America, a region commonly overlooked by scholars. We examine a decade of public opinion surveys by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) from 2008 to 2018 to explore the individual-level determinants of partisan attachments with sixty-six leftist and rightist parties in six Central American countries to test four hypotheses. While differences across countries exist, self-placement on the left-right ideological scale, engagement in societal organizations, and protest participation help portray partisan attachments."

We contend that autocrats can weaponise conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to shore up electoral support under democratic backsliding. In this vein, we analyse the impact of Honduras's Bono 10,000, a discretionary CCT, on the electoral support for the incumbent National Party and opposition blocs between 2013 and 2017, an era marked by the erosion of democracy. Using two survey waves from the AmericasBarometer by the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP), we show how the CCT boosted the electoral support for the National Party as democracy unravelled. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on how autocrats rely on carrots – not just sticks – to consolidate power."

Coups are junctures that can increase polarization and explain party system disruption—measured in the dynamics and determinants of inter-party competition. Until recently, scholars labeled Honduras’s party system as one of Latin America’s most institutionalized, albeit based on clientelist linkages. The 2009 coup against President Manuel Zelaya abruptly ended decades of two-party rule. We use presidential and legislative election results and the AmericasBarometer surveys to assess the coup’s impact on vote choice. The evidence shows that the coup jumpstarted an ideological alignment in a party system where clientelism had historically thrived."

Using three waves of Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) surveys from 2006 to 2016, we present binary logit models to test four hypotheses on the evolution of support for the FSLN. Following the theory of how the elite’s cues and messages impact public opinion, we find substantial shifts in the determinants of support for the former guerrilla group as democratic backsliding deepened. We report that the FSLN turned into an ideologically pragmatic party after initially appealing to leftist supporters. Economic views also profoundly impact the party’s support – before and after voters elected it to the presidency in 2006."
1456,7,"TITLE: The disruption of an institutionalised and polarised party system: Discontent with democracy and the rise of Nayib Bukele in El Salvador | KEYWORDS: El Salvador; Latin America; left-right ideology; mavericks; party system disruption | ABSTRACT: Studies on party system collapse or individual-party breakdowns view programmatic inconsistency or convergence as necessary for abrupt party system change. In theory, a new or fringe contender can suddenly emerge and disrupt the party system under such circumstances. We test that claim by examining Nayib Bukele’s 2019 presidential election victory in El Salvador. With data from the AmericasBarometer, we estimate probit models and predictive margins to examine the individual-level determinants of disruption in an institutionalised and ideologically polarised party system. The empirical results reveal that Bukele won amid salient ideological differences between traditional parties and that critical views towards democracy fueled his core support. Therefore, we conclude that a significant disruption in an institutionalised party system can occur notwithstanding robust ideological differences between leading contenders. Critical attitudes towards democracy can represent a driving force behind a party system’s disruption."

Mass partisanship, ideological attachments, and the puzzle of Guatemala's electoral market failure | KEYWORDS: deinstitutionalized party systems; Guatemala; ideological identification; left-right scale; party identification | ABSTRACT: The demand for an ideologically based party system is not always met with a supply. As a country where a large majority of adults identify on the ideological scale but whose weak political parties primarily function as short-lived personalist platforms, Guatemala represents an extreme case of a demand supply mismatch. Using six AmericasBarometer surveys from 2008 to 2018, we analyze the supply-side (partisanship) and demand-side (ideological identification) effect on voter turnout to identify whether the manifestation of this market failure applies evenly to voters across the ideological scale. We report a nuanced outcome: partisanship and identification on the right of the ideological scale increase turnout, but identification on the center or the left display no significant effect. The absence of parties that effectively represents left-wing or centrist voters—or that at least induce them to turn out to vote—points to a supply-side problem in Guatemala's political representation market."

To clarify the boundaries between both concepts, we distinguish between abrupt and gradual realignments. While both imply change, they differ in the number of election cycles involved. Abrupt realignments occur in a single election cycle, while gradual realignments take place in two or more. We apply this conceptualisation to Costa Rica, Latin America’s longest-running democracy, and a country where the party system has decayed without collapsing. To better identify the type of change that has taken place, we use canton-level election data from 1958 to 2018 and public opinion surveys from 1978 to 2018. The evidence contests the notion of electoral dealignment. Instead, we show that the party system experienced an abrupt realignment in the 2002 election and gradual realignment in more recent election cycles."
1460,7,"TITLE: The Determinants of Perception of Corruption in Guatemala, 2006–2016 | KEYWORDS: Corruption scandals; Guatemala; perception of corruption; sociotropic views | ABSTRACT: The September 2015 ousting and imprisonment of Guatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina and the subsequent election of television personality Jimmy Morales, who ran on an anticorruption platform, were interpreted as evidence of the salience of corruption as a popular concern in the country. Using the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) from 2006 to 2016, this article analyzes the evolution in the perception of corruption in Guatemala and its determinants to assess for changes after 2015. Perception of corruption remains a secondary concern for most Guatemalans and its determinants—age; education; rightwing ideology; and retrospective economic outlook—are stable overtime. The 2015 corruption scandal had a marginal impact on an already high perception of corruption. When perception of corruption is so widespread, the explanatory power of its determinants becomes less pronounced."

His approval fluctuated significantly, experiencing an overall downward decline. Under favorable economic conditions, declining presidential approval must be explained by things other than economic vote. Using logistic regression models and predicted probabilities based on presidential approval polls, we test four hypotheses on the determinants of approval for Piñera: a punishment vote against the Concertación, support tied to economic performance, issue-based support, and the cost of ruling. There is evidence in support of each of the four hypotheses. Although voting for Piñera might have been a one-night stand, economic vote determinants and, to a lesser extent, issue salience and the cost of ruling explain presidential approval under Piñera."

Here we operationalize malaise as a combination of political disaffection, distrust with political institutions and government disapproval. We conclude that the malaise with democracy is not a systematic outcome of either the quality of democracy or the human development index. Rather, it is associated to inequality. At the individual level, malaise is more intense among the youth and in the lower-income segments of the population."

We investigate how Iowa organizers from the Bakken Pipeline Resistance Coalition, Mississippi Stand, and Little Creek Camp employed diverse actions to resist DAPL including participation in the Iowa Utilities Board permitting process, a legal challenge, protests, and sabotage. Drawing on data collection and fieldwork conducted between 2020–2023, we argue that the transgressive movement used insurgent planning to transform Iowa's energy landscape, provoking a strong response from the state including surveillance and a “Critical Infrastructure Bill”. We demonstrate that Iowa organizers traversed invited and invented spaces, creating a resistance toolbox used in contemporary energy contests. This case study unsettles the idea that organizers must work either within or outside state-led institutions to enact change; expands the geographical focus of insurgent planning; and uses an intersectional lens to make visible the work of women, Indigenous, and rural organizers in Iowa."

In doing so, these mappings unveil how Cartesian cartography does the traumatic work of coloniality while fostering alternative, embodied spatial imaginaries based on situated practices and visceral geographies. The article discusses three mapping projects completed at different times through distinct approaches in Venezuela, Chile, and the Dominican Republic to illuminate the pluriversality of subaltern geographies within the context of historical trauma. We suggest that the process of developing other mappings in tandem with communities constitutes decolonial methodologies that disrupt the notion of maps as traditionally understood and utilized in urban planning and development. Thus, we go beyond the tradition of participatory mapping as a technical means of visibilizing subaltern territorial claims, land-uses, and preservation practices by focusing on the potentials of other mappings to foster critical thinking, dialogue, and action."
1468,-1,"TITLE: INSURGENT HERITAGE: Mobilizing Memory, Place-based Care and Cultural Citizenships | KEYWORDS: Chile; community engagement; critical heritage; historic preservation; industrial heritage; insurgent planning; Latin America; politics in feminine | ABSTRACT: Bridging critical heritage studies with insurgent planning theory, this article proposes the notion of ‘insurgent heritage’ to discuss heritage preservation's role in constructing urban citizenship in Latin America. Critical heritage scholars have pointed to the European dominant heritage discourse deployed worldwide that excludes subordinated voices in the production of heritage. The research has also illuminated alternative understandings of preservation that sit outside of or opposed to the state and the cultural elites’ concept of what should or should not be preserved. My use of insurgent heritage adds another layer of nuance to this body of work. It promotes a pluriversal perspective by building on Southern urbanisms, Latin American social collective action, and feminist scholarship. Inspired by ethnographic work with heritage grassroots organizations in Chile, this line of argument shows that communities’ local knowledge pushes against the practice of heritage preservation and planning by only sanctioned experts. Instead, by transgressing false dichotomies of informal and formal arenas of politics, insurgent heritage proposes multiple perspectives to envision alternative futures. It reframes grassroots heritage as a sociocultural process mediated by the interplay of memory-work and the specifics of place as an ethical form of place-based care that highlights the cultural dimension of citizenship."

Inspired by Arturo Escobar’s notion of the “Pluriverse,” this article proposes a “pluriversal planning scholarship,” to articulate the theoretical and community-based contributions of an evolving stream of planning research that embraces multiplicity, coexistence, and critical thinking. Through a review of over 300 publications in top planning journals, we suggest that pluriversal scholars engage in creative methodologies to do community-based work. They contribute to extending planning theory by drawing from other fields, such as Black feminism, decolonial thought, and Indigenous studies to highlight the everyday experiences and resistances of residents despite a state that is failing them. Additionally, they actively contribute to community-based work through reciprocal theory development with community members, capacity building, and visibilizing residents’ stories when appropriate."

Previous studies claim that both are based on affective and cognitive dimensions. However, their complexity and meaning are understudied, especially among adolescents and in different cultural and institutional contexts. The current research explores how early, middle, and late adolescents from Serbia, Italy, and Czechia built interpersonal and political trust during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 18 online focus groups with 88 participants. The results of reflexive thematic analysis exposed various bases of affective (care, similarity, and reciprocity) and cognitive (knowledge, expertise, competence, and criticalness) dimensions of interpersonal and political trust building, respectively. Adolescents perceive the dimensions as separate and interconnected, allowing them to simultaneously trust and distrust the same individual or political figure. Beyond the crisis context, longitudinal research on the dimensions of political and interpersonal trust is necessary."
1472,7,"TITLE: Mapping sovereignism(s) in South America | KEYWORDS: Latin America; political ideology; populisms; sovereignism | ABSTRACT: Sovereignism is said to be on the rise: defending a nation's political autonomy, international borders, and cultural identity and protecting the domestic economy from the perils of globalisation are core demands. What about Latin America? To what extent are sovereignist claims a key component of Latin American parties' platforms and rhetoric? How do these vary according to national contexts and ideological foundations? Is sovereignism truly novel in the region? This article, relying on qualitative analyses of party manifestos from six different countries, as well as on data from the Manifesto Project, aims to map Latin American sovereignism in its different dimensions (political, economic, cultural, international) according to country and party families. As our data show, claims for defending or achieving ‘sovereignty’ are a key component of the (mostly left-wing) populist idiolect in the region. The Latin American extreme right tends to adopt a sovereignist rhetoric to justify a traditional pro-market agenda. The article overall calls for a problematisation of the concept of ‘sovereignism’ by proposing a stronger cross-regional perspective. There are different ‘varieties of sovereignism’ depending on whether state sovereignty is primarily viewed as something to be restored or, alternatively, to be achieved (as is the case in South America)."

How did levels of trust vary with age, and why? This article addresses these questions by examining the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy as a natural experiment. Drawing on focus groups from different age cohorts and conducting a qualitative thematic analysis, we aim to determine whether and how citizens’ appraisals—and, crucially, their justifications—vary across age groups, with particular focus on youth perspectives. Our findings suggest that younger citizens based their assessments on the perceived governmental “responsibility,” whereas older citizens evaluated it on the basis of the government’s perceived “rationality.”"

1475,25,"TITLE: PLAYING “ITALIANNESS” IN POPULAR MUSIC: National populism and music in contemporary Italy | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter discusses popular music and cultural practices as vectors for the articulation of populism in contemporary Italy. Drawing on the volume’s introduction, the authors explore the ways in which populist messages are socially diffused, legitimised, and popularised within Italy through popular music. More specifically, the chapter focuses on how popular music that contains populist elements is received by individual voters who constitute the potential electoral base for populist parties, as well as on the exploitation of popular music by populist politicians (from the syncretic Five Star Movement (M5S) to the right-wing League) keen to define their own political-cultural identity and appeal to specific demographics. The chapter concludes by highlighting how the contemporary Italian popular music repertoire often affords populist interpretations. However, transforming such populist affordances into an intentional adoption of populist worldviews requires a political elaboration that the authors only rarely detected in listeners. Whilst (nationalist-)populist political elaborations are often promoted by the right-wing League, the Five Star Movement generally avoids the use of popular music for political purposes: different party cultures account for these different strategies."
1476,25,"TITLE: The nation of the people: An analysis of Podemos and Five Star Movement's discourse on the nation | KEYWORDS: left-wing nationalism; nationalism from below; patriotism; populism; Southern Europe | ABSTRACT: This article empirically explores how populist actors talk about the nation. This is a research area mostly tackled in studies on right-wing populism, with other forms of populist politics usually left out of the analysis. To fill this academic gap, we focus on the Spanish party Podemos and the Italian Five Star Movement (M5S). The former is a paradigmatic example of radical left populism, whereas the latter is commonly considered as a catch-all populist party with no clear ideological connotation. Through a discourse analysis on leaders' speeches and official public declarations, we focus on the role that national identity plays in the strategies of Podemos and M5S and on the type of nation they discursively construct. Whilst Podemos' populist strategy purposely aims at contending to the right ideologically loaded concepts and signifiers to construct an idea of nation fitting the party's leftist values, M5S's strategy mostly aims at appropriating valence issues, such as the “Made in Italy” brand and the concept of “national interest”. Thus, our analysis contributes to clarify the differences between the leftist political culture of Podemos and the “post-ideological” one of M5S, as also reflected by survey data confirming strong differences in “nationalist” attitudes between their respective electorates."

With a mixed-methods approach (including novel data from the expert survey PoPES, 31 semi-structured interviews with party representatives and militants, and analysis of party documents, statutes and leader speeches) and a comparative perspective, we explore candidate selection in the context of the broader organizational party structures over time. We find that: (1) Podemos functions like a typical centralized party, whereas M5S is a deviant case with strong and centralized control over party organization but decentralized mechanisms for candidate selection; (2) both these logics of centralization of power undermine the parties' democratic credentials but have different consequences in terms of cohesion (expulsions/departures in M5S and splintering in Podemos); and (3) in both cases, the parties' organizational culture and symbolic tools legitimate their top-down features."
1478,25,"TITLE: Populism and the (Italian) crisis: The voters and the context | KEYWORDS: causes of populism; frames; Italian crisis; varieties of populism | ABSTRACT: This article, focusing on Italy, aims to broaden our understanding of the recent striking electoral fortunes of (differing types of) populism in the country, by locating them within multiple crises (political, economic, migration) that have shocked Europe in the last two decades. By combining individual-level survey data on voters with organizational-level interviews conducted with national and local representatives and activists of the Five Star Movement and the League, the role played by these crises in the two different Italian populisms will be disentangled from ‘demand’ and ‘supply’ perspectives – which are usually treated in isolation. The findings indicate a coherence between the political parties’ message and their respective potential voters’ orientations and attitudes (with regard to the three crises), underlining the ability of different varieties of populism to intercept (and mobilize) different grievances: whereas the economic crisis of representation is a key ingredient of both the populists’ success, the cultural crisis is more salient for the exclusionary populist League, while the political crisis is more salient for the inclusionary 5SM. For both the mobilization and representation of those citizens unsatisfied with traditional politics seems crucial. These different causes of success appear to be a useful lens through which to examine the failure of an attempt to govern by combining two differing types of populism."

A Critical Juncture Framework for Latin America and Southern Europe | KEYWORDS: Anti-Austerity Politics; Latin American Politics; Party-Union Relations; Populism; Social Movements | ABSTRACT: The Latin American “Turn to the Left” consisted in either the consolidation of traditional left-of-centre parties or the emergence of new anti-neoliberal populist projects that decisively shaped the respective national party systems in reaction to major neoliberal crises. Some Southern European countries similarly experienced the rise of new populist parties (Podemos, Syriza and the Five Star Movement) while in Portugal we witnessed the consolidation of the existing left-of-centre parties. This article proposes a middle-range theory to give a cross-regional account of the eventual emergence of different anti-neoliberal populist parties in the aftermath of a neoliberal economic crisis. The argument focuses on the heterogeneity of such an ‘Anti-Neoliberal Populism’ category, by looking at the party organisation and the relationship with the unions and with the anti-austerity social movements. The framework thus proposes four different categories of “successful political projects” emerged in the aftermath of the crisis: a “Labour-based Left” (in Uruguay and Portugal); a “party-rooted populism” (in Argentina and Greece); a “movement (based) populism” (in Bolivia and Spain); and a “leader-initiated populism” (in Venezuela and Italy)."
1480,25,"TITLE: Online Hate Speech and the Radical Right in Times of Pandemic: The Italian and English Cases | KEYWORDS: Covid; hate speech; Italy; radical right; topic model analysis; United Kingdom | ABSTRACT: Social media is considered a particularly conducive arena for hate speech, a form of communication often linked to the radical right. The goal of this study is to offer an empirical contribution that comparatively explores the presence and features of hate speech in the social media discourse of the radical right (leaders and parties) in Italy and the UK during the first year of the pandemic. This mixed-methods study analyses 21,360 tweets using wordcloud analysis (to conceptually map the social media discourse of the radical right and mainstream parties), topic modelling (to identify the main topics of the radical right’s tweets and how they relate to Covid-19) and formalised content analysis (to better understand how hate speech is related to the virus). We find that radical right leaders have managed to bring exclusion-oriented issues to the agenda at this time of crisis, albeit in different ways, by emphasising different understandings of in-groups and out-groups in relation to Covid-19."

This contribution proposes a comparative analysis of the roles played by social movements in Bolivian and Argentinean ""second incorporations"", by relying on fifty in-depth interviews with partisan and movement leaders in both countries, in order to assess the different characteristics and consequences of the processes of ""second incorporation"" in the two countries. The paper argues that the extent to which such actors provide an encompassing representation of 'excluded sectors' is key to understand how different forms of political incorporation shaped different 'social blocs' either supporting or contrasting progressive political projects in power, and eventually created the conditions, in the medium term, for the electoral rise of right-wing opponents."

The research relies on over thirty interviews to social and political actors, and on secondary literature. The research recuperates classic analytical tools to explore the different levels of influence reached by the main social organizations surrounding (or composing) the MAS-IPSP and to highlight the role of two relevant conflictual dimensions within the former masista-coalition (salaried versus self-employed workers, indigenism versus developmentalism, among others) which in the middle term jeopardised the hegemony of the MAS-IPSP in Bolivia."

We highlight the role that cultural and symbolic 'products' (such as music, emotions, narratives, and visual symbols) play in the emergence and spread of populism. First, we explore the opportunities afforded by understanding the concept of populism from a cultural/symbolic point of view, reaching beyond the traditional party politics literature to which it is usually confined. Second, we suggest different ways in which populism has been articulated in various European countries (e.g. popular cultures, subcultures) since the economic crisis of 2008, emphasizing music, narratives, visuals, and emo-tions as means of the populist symbolic construction of the political and social reality. Third, from a social movement perspective, we reflect on the mechanisms (cognitive, emotional, normative) that may help understanding the current populist 'momentum', as well as on the methods to empirically grasp them."
1484,25,"TITLE: “Part of the elite”? Anti-austerity populism and trade unionism in Italy and Spain ¿«Parte de la élite»? Populismo anti-austeridad y sindicalismo en Italia y España | KEYWORDS: Populism; Union politics; Welfare regime | ABSTRACT: A broad literature has analyzed the effects of Mediterranean welfare regimes on the political-electoral sphere and on the policy making process. Part of the literature on the insider-outsider divide has identified in the insiders the real core-constituency of the social democratic parties. The union movement, politically linked to the main left-of-center parties, would similarly show poor ability of representing the interests of the outsiders. Since the beginning of the Great Recession, new parties advancing a populist discourse have been able to attract vast segments of the leftist electorate. This article focuses on Podemos and the Five Star Movement and explores, mainly through in-depth interviews with political and union leaders, to which extent the critiques advanced by these parties towards the union organizations are motivated by the normative implications of the insider-outsider literature. The analysis shows that the critiques are more related with the ancillary role played by the unions towards their political referents than with their supposed “over-protection” of the insiders. However, it emerges that the stances assumed by the two parties towards unionism diverge, due to different ideological and “meta-political” roots: while Podemos can potentially develop a relationship of cooperation with trade unionism, the Five Star Movement positions itself as a competitor."
1485,25,"TITLE: The populist re-politicization: Some lessons from South America and Southern Europe | KEYWORDS: Latin America; Party organization; Political representation; Populism; Southern Europe | ABSTRACT: This article proposes an alternative categorization of the populist phenomena, by elaborating the distinction between electoral-delegative and participative-mobilising populisms. All the populist phenomena share some common traits, such as a polarising and antagonist discourse dividing the society into a ""People"" and some ""elites"" or privileged sectors, their reliance on a strong leadership, a pretension to be majoritarian and to achieve the power at the national level in order to restore the sovereignty of the People. Nonetheless, the strategies for achieving these goals vary according to the specific diagnoses that would correct the perceived deficiencies of the representative democracies in terms of accountability of the representatives. The populisms closer to the electoral-delegative pole stress the symbolic dimension of the concept of representation, thus relying on a strong leader able to ""truly interpret"" the general will of the People. Those closer to the participative-mobilising pole call for an active involvement of the People in the decision-making process in order to effectively control the public institutions, stressing the descriptive dimension of the concept of representation and sometimes questioning the theoretical bases sustaining the representative democracy. I provide a brief discussion on four participative-mobilising populist experiences, i.e. the MAS-IPSP, the Kirchnerism, the M5S and Podemos, focusing on their internal organizations and relying on an extensive fieldwork (consisting in one hundred in-depth interviews with country experts and party's representatives at regional and national levels) that I conducted for a broader research project."

Based on a documentary review of his work and critical contributions by other authors, we distinguish his critical Utopian understanding of today's societies, and the need to renew the processes of knowledge construction. On the one hand, this work integrates Santos' criticism of modernity with his Utopian proposal and his relations with southern hemisphere epistemologies, the ecology of knowledge and intercultural translation. On the other, it identifies concrete strategies for knowledge generation from an intercultural perspective. The conclusions are oriented toward a critical assessment of the discussion developed with Santos, and its relevance in the context of the social sciences in Latin America."

The corpus analyzed is made up of 700 yes/ no or polar interrogative sentences corresponding to written texts, extracted from the Corpus del Espanol del Siglo XXI (CORPES XXI). Our analysis revealed a partial correspondence with Freed's (1994) and Escandell's (1999) postulates regarding the association between the syntactic order of the utterance and its pragmatic value. Moreover, a differentiated behavior according to geographical areas was observed, in which Spain is the area that tends to postpose the subject more markedly, independently of pragmatic value, while the Continental Caribbean, Chile, and Rio de la Plata areas showed a tendency towards anteposition. The quantitative analysis showed that the pragmatic categories corresponding to subjectio and problematic interrogatives strongly favor the VS order, while those corresponding to the real question, surprisingly, were not significantly associated with subject anteposition."

We seek to expand knowledge on South-South mobility and in particular in Latin America. We present the results of a qualitative research conducted in 2017 and 2018, based on three temporal axes: exodus and decision to migrate to Chile; settlement and trajectories; and evaluation and imaginary of the future. It is concluded that there is a positive social integration, being relevant both the perception of achieving job success and the experience of participating in a gradual process of cultural miscegenation, contributing to the construction of intercultural coexistence in Santiago. These conditions and situations are generating roots, at least in the short term."

The conclusion is that there are important differences in the integration of the different socioeconomic and “racial” groups of immigrants, in particular afrodescendant immigrants are exposed to situations of racial discrimination. Given that the afrodescendant population in Chile is newly arrived, racism against them must be explained contextualizing the “national culture” in the geoculture of the world-system, that contains a racial hierarchy shaped in the colonial era to support its racial division of labor. In this context, immigrants are received in Chile, a country imbued in this colonialist and eurocentric geoculture that explains the differential treatment given to the different immigrant groups."

Unfortunately, there is little overall evidence on this topic, and even less on how psychosocial teams structure and execute their action plans. This study explored the underlying aspects of school psychosocial planning in an educational district in Chile that implements the Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) model. The study follows a qualitative methodology, using a Narrative Workshop that allowed 59 psychosocial professionals to express their experiences without fear of judgment. To ensure anonymity and a confidential environment, participants were asked to write ""secret letters"" related to their planning process. This resulted in 96 secret letters, which were collected and categorized into two main themes and six subthemes. The findings indicate that some professionals plan with limited evidence, in isolation, and with minimal institutional validation. Additionally, planning tends to be done hastily and lacks sufficient data. These issues align with a general devaluation of the planning process. As a conclusion of the study, areas for improvement in school psychosocial planning highlight the importance of creating safe spaces for the expression of hidden experiences that may impact the effective implementation of plans."

However, the field of environmental education has not extensively explored implementation strategies, despite the existence of frameworks and taxonomies. This study aims to address this gap by identifying strategies suggested by environmental education professionals in Chile. A total of 91 participants responded to an online survey that included open-ended questions. Through content analysis, 24 categories aligned with existing frameworks and 7 categories emerging from the local context were identified. These categories were organized in a descending order, revealing the prominence of scale-up, process, capacity-building, integration, and dissemination strategies. While strategies from established frameworks were found, the study also highlights the emergence of strategies specific to the environmental education field, contextual factors, and the implementation phase of environmental education in Chile."
1492,2,"TITLE: The pluralistic ontology in youth groups for mental health | KEYWORDS: health policy (UNESCO); mental health; ontology; social interaction; youth activities | ABSTRACT: Mental problems in young people are increasing and recovery proposals from classic biomedical models are not always effective. One of the responses to this has been the Mutual Help Groups, groups made up of people who meet periodically to help each other based on principles such as trust, transversality, the creation of support networks and new possibilities for psychosocial recovery. These possibilities arise from the same people, with the help of others, to have new ways of understanding reality and approaching it, which is called the agency of possibilities. This research aims to understand the contribution that Mutual Aid Groups make to young people’s mental health through group agency. For this, an analysis is carried out through the ‘Event’, an element of the pluralistic ontology of neo-monadism, which is defined as the unification of individualities based on incalculable networks that overlap with each other to generate new questions and new answers. Using thematic analysis as an analysis tool, in-depth interviews were conducted with six young people with mental problems belonging to a Mutual Help Group. There it was found that intentional states broadly explain world-to-mind, mind-to-world and mind-to-mind functional relationships and interactions, which contributes to ontological pluralism as a new paradigm for addressing social problems. Mental health care has long sought to control people. In this sense, negative adaptation guarantees recovery in vain. On the other hand, positive adaptation, from desires, from heterogeneous forces and beliefs, could be a more effective recovery path."

Moreover, few studies on this role have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries. This study explores and describes the mental health actions undertaken by teachers in schools and categorizes them using latent class analysis. The study collected data from 726 teachers in Chile using snowball sampling. Three self-reported questionnaires were administered: Mental Health Actions and Teaching Role Questionnaire; Interprofessional Competence in Mental Health Questionnaire and Checklist of Mental Health Issues Addressed in School. The results showed that teachers play a significant role in identifying and addressing mental health issues among students, with 90% of respondents reporting that they had provided support to students with mental health concerns. The results also suggest that teachers face several challenges in this role, including a lack of training and resources, time constraints, and the need for better communication and collaboration with mental health professionals. Six latent class of teachers was founded: ow activity Class, Classroom-Centered Class, Individual Emotional Support-Centered Class, Self-Care and Professional Development Class, Mental Health Curriculum-Centered Class, and High activity Class. Based on the results provides applied recommendations for teachers to support their students' mental health, such as creating a safe and supportive classroom environment, promoting social-emotional learning, and collaborating with specialised school mental health professionals. Overall, this study highlights the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to school mental health that involves teachers, mental health professionals, and other stakeholders."
1494,-1,"TITLE: Determinants of the implementation of participatory actions in the environmental education with children and adolescents in Chile | KEYWORDS: children and adolescents’ participation; determinants of implementation; Environmental education; participatory education | ABSTRACT: Internationally, academics and social organizations have emphasized the incorporation of the perspective of children and adolescents in the design, evaluation, and execution of environmental education activities. This study sought to identify those contextual factors that influence the implementation of participatory actions in environmental education. An online survey was applied to 78 teachers, non-formal educators, administrators, researchers and journalists involved in environmental education. Through thematic content analysis, 17 determinants of implementation were identified, highlighting the traditional education model, cultural patterns, willing and social support, time, resources, and organizational drivers. It is argued that beyond macro and meso structural conditions, the implementation of these actions falls on a greater measure in the self-efficacy of the people involved in education, as well as in their possibility to manage the implementation conditions and obstacles."

Although they have been singled out by the evidence, specific information on their nuclear components is lacking. Based on the methodological approach of Arksey and O’Malley and the Joanna Briggs Institute, all research studies (Pubmed, Scopus, Scielo, Embase, and Redalyc) and gray literature examining these groups were included. The search was carried out throughout 2022 with the following codes: mutual aid groups; self-help groups. We reviewed 62 papers and 37 were included from a total of 2064 articles. The study shows that the components associated with beneficial results are: active agency, coping strategies, recognition, management of emotions, problem-solving strategies, supportive interaction, trust, self-identity construction, and strengthening of social networks. Thus, it reaffirms that mags are an effective option to address health problems. The application of these components could also contribute to achieve these benefits."

To implement them successfully, schools must be prepared. However, research has paid little attention to this process. The purpose of this study was to analyze the organizational readiness to implement these systems in public schools by school administrators and psychosocial intervention professionals (e.g., psychologists and social workers) in a school district in Chile. A total of 178 participants from 54 public schools participated. The Organizational Readiness for Change Implementation Scale and the Implementation Determinants Survey were applied online. A high level of commitment to implementation was found, but a low level of capacity to carry out the changes. Regarding implementation, it was found that psychosocial professionals perceive a low level of technical empowerment compared to coordination, as well as low perceived support from the educational community. In all dimensions, the managers' scores were higher. It is argued that schools are not yet ready to implement multilevel support systems, and that it is necessary to invest in greater implementation supports and in instances that allow closing the gap in the perception of principals and staff."

However, we currently lack a validated quantitative instrument to assess those approaches at a subjective level. Landini and Beramendi (2019) developed a psychometric scale to access rural extension agents' beliefs about extension and innovation (BExIn scale) and validated it in Argentina. In this paper, a transcultural validation of this scale is conducted using samples from Argentina (n = 608), Brazil (n = 279), Chile (n = 196), Mexico (n = 1727), and Nigeria (n = 121). The analysis was conducted using Unweighted Least Squares extraction method and MPLUS software. The results show satisfactory indexes of goodness of fit and internal consistency, evidencing configural invariance and invariance of factor loadings. This implies that the scale assesses the same construct in all cases and that the structure of meanings that organizes these beliefs is essentially the same in different countries (differences between countries and individuals only refer to different ways of valuing the elements within the same general structure). The scale can be used to assess in English, Portuguese and Spanish extension agents’ beliefs about extension and innovation, to compare between countries and institutions, to make human resources decisions, to evaluate the impact of specific academic degrees or educational courses on extension and innovation beliefs, and to analyze strategies aimed at addressing beliefs that contribute to the persistence of a transfer of technology approach. The results suggest that the acknowledgment of otherness contributes to participatory and horizontal extension practices based on bi-directional communication, and that a self-critical attitude reduces the beliefs that shape a transfer of technologies approach."

This study analyzed the technical bases of a Chilean public program and interviewed thirteen extensionists who implement it. It was found that professionals are adherent to technical visits as well as group trainings, and that emotional and pedagogical competencies are fundamental. The main facilitators of these actions are peer relationships and social commitment, while institutionalism is the most critical obstacle. The importance of addressing these factors to increase program quality is further discussed."
1499,-1,"TITLE: Levels of participation of children and adolescents in research on environmental education in hispanic america (1999-2019) | KEYWORDS: Adolescent participation; Child participation; Environmental education; Environmental education research; Systematized bibliographic review | ABSTRACT: Historically, a whole participatory and horizontal tradition has been recognized in environmental education, even so, empirical research describes low levels of participation of children's and adolescents in this type of education and in its research field. Despite this, there are few investigations that measure participation, limiting these to describing case studies, which hardly allows a global idea of the levels of child and adolescent participation in the field. To clarify that, a systematized bibliographic review of environmental education research written in Spanish from 1999 to 2019 was carried out, in which children and adolescents participate in different degrees of involvement. The level of participation of each of these was coded using Roger Hart's ladder of child participation, which describes eight different rungs. This was correlated by statistical analysis and non-parametric tests with the year and country of publication, the type of education and the methodology used. The results indicate a progressive increase in the levels of child and adolescent participation from 1999 to date, as well as higher levels in non-formal environmental education, if qualitative methodologies are used to research and in authors from Argentina and Cuba. The importance of rethinking the place of children's and adolescents in the development of environmental education and environmental education research is discussed."

Given the current climate crisis, in environmental education this challenge generates interest despite the lack of background in the field. Objective: The purpose of this research was to identify the role of a collaborative network in the implementation of a local environmental education program. Materials and methods: An analysis of the content of surveys, focus groups and teaching sessions was carried out, in which 70 educational actors from the establishments that are part of the program participated. Results: Four categories related to the program's intervention model were identified: ecocitizenship, greening of the school, institutional greening and territorial awareness. At the same time, it was detected that the network fulfills the function of sustaining the implementation of these four aspects, being an administrative support, leadership, development of competencies and social support. Conclusions: The importance of promoting collaborative networks at multiple levels of environmental education programs to facilitate their capacity for transformation is discussed, especially in contexts where technical guidelines and structural resources for their execution are lacking."

The purpose of this research paper was to identify contextual barriers and facilitators of the implementation of a program of pedagogical innovation and education for the sustainability of the municipality, carried out in a city in the south of Chile. The sample consisted of 36 teacher coordinators of schools where the program is implemented. During an assessment session, the researchers applied an open-ended question survey, aimed at investigating the contextual factors affecting the implementation. Subsequently, through focal groups, these factors were delved into with the same participants. The authors found that the critical factors are: (1) the support and motivation of the community; (2) the curricular integration of the program; (3) the implementation supports; and (4) the expertise of the executing teacher. The transculturality of the identified factors is analyzed and the practical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed."

A qualitative study of a chilean case El vínculo con los pequeños agricultores como factor clave en la implementación de programas de extensión rural. Estudio cualitativo de un caso chileno | KEYWORDS: Formative evaluation; Government policy; Professional personnel; Rural development | ABSTRACT: We investigated the barriers facilitators critical of the effective implementation of a local program of agricultural extension programmes from the perspective of Chilean extensionists. We interviewed 13 professionals who apply the Local Development Program (PRODESAL) in eight communes of the Metropolitan Region. The results show that the primary perceived barriers are the lack of institutional support in skill development the execution of operational processes. Among the key facilitators workers highlight the emotional connection with small-scale farmers that articulate diverse approaches the quality of implementation. We discussed practical implications for the successful design execution of rural development policies.

This study investigates in this field through the description of mental health problems present in schools, the contextual conditions of implementation and the necessary interventions to be carried out from Chilean professionals’ perspective. An on-line survey was administered to 197 school mental health professionals who implemented the Skills for Life Program throughout the country. A quantitative content analysis was used to analyze the answers. It was found that the major difficulty of mental health faced by professionals is the externalizing behavior regarding the contextual conditions that obstacle implementation, the educational model and the lack of spaces in the school agenda stand out. On the other hand, professionals suggest that it is necessary to intervene with parents and teachers, strengthening this way auxiliary actions, such as the articulation of networks inside and outside the school. The results are discussed in light of international evidence highlighting the need to deepen national investigations."
1505,3,"TITLE: Towards inclusive transport landscapes: Re-visualising a Bicycle Sharing Scheme in Santiago Metropolitan Region | KEYWORDS: Bicycle Sharing System; Data Visualisation; Global South; Public Tendering; Urban Transport Equality | ABSTRACT: Bicycle Sharing Schemes (BSS) are re-emerging as promising components of urban mobility solutions worldwide. However, the lack of consistent collaboration strategies between different actors and institutions, which have been tested in a wide range of cities and contexts regarding their design, tender, operation and expansion, raises significant social and governance implications. Urban transport features as a melting pot for diverse policy objectives, ranging from business model innovation, public tendering, and accessibility increase to the equity and social justice agenda. By employing a Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework and by introducing alluvial diagrams and circular dendrograms to BSS planning through a mixed-methods approach, this article illustrates an innovative tool in managing BSS in the context of the Global South. The strength of such diagrams has been underestimated to date since they can be particularly useful for public and private urban transport planners and policy-makers. Visualising user flows in such a manner, particularly in near-live time, may offer valuable insight on the operational challenges of BSS. Findings of the cross-sectional survey in Santiago de Chile confirm that maintenance is significant for user satisfaction levels. Furthermore, decisions regarding BSS expansion and modification could be based on such analysis and diagrams due to the precise identification of both the busiest and those under-represented BSS stations based on revealed preferences."
1506,3,"TITLE: I want to ride it where I like: measuring design preferences in cycling infrastructure | KEYWORDS: Cycling infrastructure; Discrete choice; Integrated choice and latent class models; Urban cycling | ABSTRACT: Sidewalk cyclists are a major concern to planners in many cities around the world: they are considerable in numbers, and increase the risk of injury not only to pedestrians but also to themselves. Considering this, planners need evidence to design streets that nudge users into a more desirable behavior from a social perspective. This study analyzes a stated preferences survey that investigates commuters’ preferences for cycling at the sidewalk or street level. With this data, three models were calibrated: two Binomial Logit Models and an Integrated Choice and Latent Class Model. The three showed similar results in terms of preferences, with the ones including users’ characteristics providing richer behavioral insight and a better fit to observed results. On average, respondents prefer infrastructure located at the road level, especially if it is wide and not built next to bus routes. This preference for the road is even stronger in commuters that cycle to work often. We also conclude that building at the sidewalk level is not recommendable, especially in dense urban areas, and that design of cycling infrastructure can and should be informed by quantitative methods like the one proposed here."

However, its realization is variable and depends on complex strategic configurations. The objective of this study was to understand the discourse of Chilean state actions of recognition and reparation of human rights violations perpetrated in the last dictatorship (1973-1990) and in the period known as Social Outbreak (2019-2022). From a governmentality perspective, we analyze the discourse of state actions at both junctures, exploring the national trajectory in terms of reparations. We distinguish a process of construction and stabilization between 1990-2011, in which state action addressed the political community and individual victims through the notions of truth, reconciliation and comprehensive reparations. By contrast, during the period 2019-2023 the status of the human rights violation became the object of public controversy and contentious politics, shaping a reparation labeled as comprehensive but focused on treating physical injuries. Contrary to the accumulated experience, political community and individuals were displaced as subjects of recognition and reparation, highlighting the biological body as the main object of the State's reparatory action."

Considering that social research faces the complex challenge of studying a dynamic phenomenon which occurs in discourse, we argue for the importance of creating methodological procedures accordingly."
1509,2,"TITLE: Towards psychedelic apprenticeship: Developing a gentle touch for the mediation and validation of psychedelic-induced insights and revelations | KEYWORDS: ayahuasca; know-how; neurophenomenology; psilocybin; psychedelic therapy; revelations | ABSTRACT: A striking feature of psychedelics is their ability to increase attribution of truth and meaningfulness to specific contents and ideas experienced, which may persist long after psychedelic effects have subsided. We propose that processes underlying conferral of meaning and truth in psychedelic experiences may act as a double-edged sword: while these may drive important therapeutic benefits, they also raise important considerations regarding the validation and mediation of knowledge gained during these experiences. Specifically, the ability of psychedelics to induce noetic feelings of revelation may enhance the significance and attribution of reality to specific beliefs, worldviews, and apparent memories which might exacerbate the risk of iatrogenic complications that other psychotherapeutic approaches have historically faced, such as false memory syndrome. These considerations are timely, as the use of psychedelics is becoming increasingly mainstream, in an environment marked by the emergence of strong commercial interest for psychedelic therapy. We elaborate on these ethical challenges via three examples illustrating issues of validation and mediation in therapeutic, neo-shamanic and research contexts involving psychedelic use. Finally, we propose a pragmatic framework to attend to these challenges based on an ethical approach which considers the embeddedness of psychedelic experiences within larger historical and cultural contexts, their intersubjective character and the use of practices which we conceptualise here as forms of psychedelic apprenticeship. This notion of apprenticeship goes beyond current approaches of preparation and integration by stressing the central importance of validation practices based on empathic resonance by an experienced therapist or guide."
1510,-1,"TITLE: Maternal and paternal attachment and subjective well-being in adolescents who experienced parental divorce | KEYWORDS: adolescents; parental attachment; parental divorce; self-esteem; subjective well-being | ABSTRACT: Background: The existing body of research has revealed links among parental attachment, self-esteem, and subjective well-being in adolescents. However, there is a notable dearth of studies investigating these connections specifically within the context of adolescents dealing with parental divorce. Objective: This study examined both direct and indirect associations between parental attachment during adolescence and subjective well-being mediated by self-esteem among individuals dealing with parental divorce. Method: A total of 204 adolescents (female: n = 83; mean age = 14.43 years, SD = 1.55) whose parents were divorced were recruited for this study and completed a self-administered questionnaire including measures of parental attachment, self-esteem, and subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive and negative affect). Results: A structural equation model revealed the following for adolescents whose parents had undergone divorce: (a) There was a significant positive association between maternal (although not paternal) attachment and subjective well-being. (b) Self-esteem mediated the association of maternal attachment with subjective well-being. (c) These associations were not moderated by the participants' assigned sex at birth. Note: Throughout this article, we use the noun sex to refer to the sex assigned at birth (boy or girl, man or woman), for economy of language. Conclusion: We emphasize the significance of nurturing secure parent–adolescent attachments and cultivating enhanced self-esteem as potential avenues to bolster the well-being of adolescents navigating the challenges posed by parental divorce. Implications: These findings have impact for the understanding of the attachment–well-being dynamics involved after parental divorce among adolescents."

Validation of a Scale of Motivational Postures Toward the Police in Spanish | KEYWORDS: motivational postures; police; police legitimacy; scale validation | ABSTRACT: This article addressed the critical issue of citizens’ attitudes toward law enforcement, focusing on motivational postures toward the police (i.e., the psychological dispositions that individuals maintain toward the police). The study contributes by providing the first validated motivational postures scale toward the police in Spanish. It responds to a gap in research on motivational postures within Spanish-speaking societies and the absence of properly validated scales in both English and Spanish. Using two independent online panel samples from Chile, exploratory (Study 1, n = 1,163) and confirmatory (Study 2, n = 770) factor analyses were conducted refining a scale that initially proposed five postures (commitment, capitulation, resistance, disengagement, game-playing). Surprisingly, a sixth posture, termed avoidance, emerged in Study 1, reflecting a physical–behavioral dimension of distancing from the police. The scale with dimensions of six motivational postures was validated with satisfactory results, evidenced by favorable fit indices and factor loadings. Concurrently validated, the scale exhibited correlations with positive and negative emotions toward the police, procedural justice, legitimacy, and identification with the police. However, divergent validation results were unexpected, revealing correlations between trait aggressiveness and motivational postures, possibly influenced by the context of heightened police repression. Given the relevance of citizen– police dynamics in democratic societies, this research offers insights crucial for reducing conflict and violence between citizens and the police. Future studies are encouraged to explore the contextual relevance of the avoidance dimension, replicate divergent validity analyses using alternative variables, and validate the scale in other Spanish-speaking contexts."

Initially, research focused mainly on prejudice, using qualitative techniques. Studies on LGBTIQ+ populations, using more sophisticated psychosocial theories such as those of Herek or Meyer, began in the mid-1990s. This study deals with surveys and scales based on non-probabilistic samples, LGBTIQ+ populations being the first studied. In the early 2000s, queer and/or LGBTIQ+ theories were introduced, and research has been much more interdisciplinary. This paper describes the theoretical frameworks used in LGBTIQ+ research in Latin America and examines distinctions in the findings from Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. Future research must involve cross-cultural studies, systematic or scoping reviews, and studies on non-binary populations. Finally, the conditions for reimaging LGBTIQ+ research in Latin America are discussed."
1513,18,"TITLE: The negative effects of internalized homonegativity on sexual satisfaction: dyadic effects and gender-based differences in Chile | KEYWORDS: Internalized homonegativity; internalized homophobia; minority stress; positive sexuality; same-sex couples | ABSTRACT: Heterosexism is not only expressed through sexual prejudice as an external stressor, but also as an internalized rejection toward one’s own (and others’) sexually diverse identity. That is, lesbian women and gay men themselves internalize negative societal attitudes toward their sexual orientation and identity—a phenomenon called internalized homonegativity. A wealth of research shows that internalized homonegativity negatively affects the health and social adjustment of gay and lesbian people. However, the literature has documented this trend from an individual (over a dyadic) perspective, and largely among gay (over lesbian) samples. To address this oversight, we analyzed data from 210 gay and lesbian couples in Chile to examine both actor and partner effects of internalized homonegativity on their sexual satisfaction. Results from moderation analyses from an actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) approach show that partners’ internalized homonegativity negatively affects actor sexual satisfaction, a pattern significantly moderated by gender; that is, only observed among lesbian couples. Our results further demonstrated that these effects hold above and beyond the actor and partner effects of age and relationship satisfaction, as well as relationship length. These results are consistent with the broader literature, which discusses the specific features of internalized homonegativity in lesbian women, characterized—among other aspects—by restrictive social demands over their sexuality. Accordingly, our findings highlight the deleterious relational consequences of internalized homonegativity and offer a relevant empirical contribution to the understanding of specific minority stress dynamics among lesbian women."

According to the results, symbolic exclusion is explained by the political ideology of the participants, their social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, system justification and one specific moral foundations’ dimension: harm/care. On the other hand, right-wing authoritarianism, system justification, political ideology, and two specific moral foundations (loyalty/betrayal and authority/subversion) play an important role in predicting the historical negation of negative events affecting the Mapuche Indigenous people in Chile. Our results are discussed in terms of their implications for present-day intergroup relations between the Mapuche and non-Indigenous Chileans."
1515,18,"TITLE: Homosexuality Justification and Social Distance: A Cross-Cultural Approach from Latin America Using World Values Survey Data | KEYWORDS: Attitudes; Central America; Homosexuality; South America | ABSTRACT: The social and legal situation of lesbian, gay men, bisexual, and transgender people (LGBT) has improved in recent years. At the same time, attitudes toward LGBT populations have changed over time, increasingly into more favorable opinions of LGBT people. However, despite this promising scenario, stigmatization, prejudice, and discrimination still persist, as well as hate crimes against LGBT people. Various studies have shown the persistence of these violence acts as a social stressor that affects the well-being and quality of life of LGBT people, who experience detrimental effects in their physical and mental health compared to non-LGBT population. The foregoing makes it essential to know the situation of each country and the region regarding this issue. Empirical LGBT research has mostly focused on Northamerican and European samples. Then, it is essential to know the situation of the Central and South regions specially Latin American countries. From a psychosocial and cross-cultural perspective, we used information available form World Values Survey to analyze attitudes toward LGBT people and their evolution in Latin American countries."
1516,18,"TITLE: Romantic Attachment and Relationship Satisfaction in Gay Men and Lesbians in Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Attachment theory has proven to be a solid framework for understanding couple bonds, but research focused on same-sex relationships among gay men and lesbian women from Latin America remains limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between romantic attachment and relationship satisfaction in a sample of Chilean gay men and lesbian women. A snowball sampling was used. The final sample consisted of 259 individuals involved in a same-sex couple relationship, ranging from 18 to 66 years of age (M = 27.2, SD = 6.8) for gay men and 18 to 57 years of age (M = 28.6, SD = 8.1) for lesbian women. Our hypotheses were partially supported, as there was a negative association between attachment avoidance and relationship satisfaction, but not between attachment anxiety and relationship satisfaction. We did not find a gender moderating effect. These findings may contribute to the understanding of lesbian and gay people in a same-sex couples relationship from an attachment theory perspective."
1517,18,"TITLE: System Justification’s Opposite Effects on Psychological Wellbeing: Testing a Moderated Mediation Model in a Gay Men and Lesbian Sample in Chile | KEYWORDS: Gay men and lesbians; internalized homophobia; psychological wellbeing; system justification | ABSTRACT: Those who adhere to system-justifying beliefs benefit from a palliative function that buffers negative effects on psychological wellbeing. This has been consistently observed for high-status groups, whereas for members of low-status groups, it remains rather unclear whether system justification exerts a positive or a negative effect. This study tested the palliative effect of system justification on symptoms of anxiety-depression in a gay men and lesbian sample (N = 467) in Chile. Results from moderated mediation analyses revealed that system justification beliefs buffer symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, system justification enhances anxious and depressive symptoms through internalized homonegativity; this mediation effect was significant for gay men. We pose that justifying the social order comprises two contradictory functions: system justification as a coping source and, otherwise, as a source of distress under conditions of in-group derogation, posing a threat to wellbeing among members of low-status groups (as observed in gay and lesbian individuals). Implications of the opposing effects and gender differences are further discussed in this study."

Having carried out a brief overview of the policies applied by the Chilean state, we evaluate those obstacles that have hindered the formation of the Mapuche political party Wallmapuwen. We believe that the formation of a political party by the indigenous people is a means to reconstitute the cultural identity, and in the future, the autonomy of the Mapuche people. At the same time, a revitalization in the collective action will need to have their own particular demands articulated strategically with different social organizations, with and without ethnic affiliation. We affirm, moreover, that ethno-regional parties in Latin America envisage fruitful organizational experiences towards the strengthening of a democratic culture."

This is due to the fact that the phenomenon of human mobility from a human rights perspective has not been a priority in the Americas region. On the contrary, this phenomenon is seen from a national security perspective, which causes that children and adolescents who require international protection are unnoticed as a result their human rights are easily attacked making them vulnerable. Due to international laws on refugees, this article proposes to find possible solutions to protect their human rights and rights recognized by refugee law. Firstly, the identification of unaccompanied refugee children and adolescents within the mixed migratory flows in the case of Mexico and Central America. Secondly, it also aims to find possible solutions to give them access to the asylum procedure as a result to protect their rights such as non-refoulement and the best interests of the child. Rights not only recognized by international refugee laws, but also by international human rights law, which are mandatory and part of the international obligations on those countries of study."

This obstacle is particularly true for Catholic Schools (made up more than 90% of religious schools in the country) that, in the last decade, have had to function over an internal crisis due to sexual abuse by the clergy. Catholic education, specifically schooling, has had a long-standing importance in the country, which adds another layer of symbolic difficulties. In this article, we present the results of a study that aimed to describe the changes experienced by the Catholic school subsystem concerning the institutional affiliation of schools to the Church, their eligibility, and school enrolment in Chile from 2013-2022. Using a quantitative research design, we found no clear relationships between changes in key variables in Catholic Church-more linked schools and the crisis of this Church, except for the drop in eligibility in one of the five analysed Chile´s administrative regions. We discussed possible explanations for what we defined as an inelastic demand for Catholic schools in the country. We also propose ways to continue the research on the matter."

Utilizing primarily qualitative methods, this study focuses on the retrospective experiences and perceptions of former students. It investigates the outcomes for low-income students who attended Saint George's as part of a socio-economic integration program, which has inspired both a film and recent policy debates on reforming Chile's national school choice system. Findings indicate a significant perceived impact on educational attainment and social mobility for former low-income students, primarily through transformed aspirations, as well as positive experiences for elite students entailing broadened social perspectives, empathy, and greater commitment to equity in social and political spheres. The study discusses theoretical contributions and policy implications related to aspirations formation, the social composition of schools, and the role of social integration in elite educational settings."

By doing so, the authors seek to provide valuable evidence to inform the development of policies to attract and maintain well-qualified teachers from industry in Chile and other countries facing similar changes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a descriptive cross-sectional design to collect data from 660 VET teachers using a two-scale instrument: Perception of Prior Occupation (PPO) and adapted FIT-Choice scales. By adopting a typological approach, the authors constructed profiles of VET teachers based on their perception of past industry experience. The authors then analyzed how these profiles vary regarding individual teacher characteristics, motivation and perception of teaching in VET. Findings: The authors found a significant degree of heterogeneity among VET teachers' prior industry experiences, leading them to identify three distinct VET teacher profiles: “High Perception of Prior Occupation,” “Learning and Teaching-Oriented” and “Low Perception of Prior Occupation.” Notably, the most distinguishing characteristics across these profiles were age, VET teaching area, holding a job outside of teaching and years of prior industry experience. Furthermore, the authors found that motivation and perceptions of teaching varied significantly across these VET teacher profiles. Originality/value: There needs to be more research on the factors that attract and retain industry workers as VET teachers in high schools. This study is among the first to address this topic in a non-European context."

Due to the historical importance of confessional schools as religious-based social organizations, and the lack of literature regarding their transformation during the last ten years, we study the evolution of such schools in Chile. Based on quantitative secondary data from the Ministry of Education, we aim to explain trends in the number and enrolment in confessional schools in the last decade based upon a New Institutionalist theoretical framework."

Using a primarily qualitative, retrospective case study design, we focus on the experiences and perceptions of former students to explore lessons from this evocative case study of socio-economic integration. Findings point to key situational differences in low-income students’ integration experiences and sense of belonging. Heterogenous experiences ranged from negative, such as bullying, discrimination, and experiences that deepened class-based identities, to experiences of support, inclusion, and friendship. Factors affecting the level and nature of integration experiences are considered in relation to contact theory and refinements to the theory are proposed to account for developmental differences in integration experiences."

However, there is not enough information on how schools and teachers embrace this new diversity. In this context, this article analyses multicultural beliefs and constructivist teaching practices in Chilean schools. Although this study tries to describe teaching beliefs and practices, it also explores, through a multivariate analysis, the explanatory factors of teachers' constructivist and multicultural tendencies. A questionnaire was applied to teachers and students to analyse and compare their perceptions and practices. The results suggest clues about the relevance of ""individual educational"" personal variables informing inclusive and culturally sensitive education. The ""systemic level"" variables, the institutional ones, do not show the same incidence in terms of multicultural beliefs and constructivist teaching practices. This statistical study opens future possibilities for complementary qualitative studies and comparative exercises."

While his work and the evolution of his thought during those five years have been previously studied, less space has been given to studying his relationship with one of the most powerful educational and intellectual poles of those years: the Jesuit order. This study is based on interviews with key informants who worked either directly with Freire or with their methods in the territory. Chile benefited from Freire's time in the country. During the harshness of his political exile, he also benefited from being in the country, as attested by the density of his thought and the work produced in those years. In particular, the Jesuit order benefited collaterally, in an overall view, from contact with the Brazilian. He was a supporting actor, but important (like all supporting actors) in inspiring perspectives within works of the Society of Jesus, and people who worked on them."

Each of them portrays a particular aspect of the experience of having a calling to teach. The narratives of these five teachers, augmented by the 76 teachers interviewed who group themselves within these focal narratives, illuminate the power of calling and suggest a rethinking of spirituality's role in teachers’ work and identity."

Neoliberalismo educacional chileno y sus posibilidades de derrumbe en una nueva constitución: ¿Es posible? | KEYWORDS: Chile; Educational system; Market; Neoliberalism; Political constitution | ABSTRACT: Chile faces writing a new constitution that will fully replace the 1980 Constitution created during the Pinochet dictatorship (1973-1990). The 1980 Constitution was built upon a neoliberal model from which the school education system has been shaped. This article presents elements about how the 1980 Constitution was constructed, its historical context, and its main influences. The article also exposes the main constitutional features that impacted the educational system and how those features translated into institutions between 1980 and 2021. The article ends with a reflection on the possibility of the collapse of the neoliberal architecture of the Chilean school education system regarding the drafting of a new constitution in the country."

Consistency among those teaching in Jesuit high schools across the Americas | KEYWORDS: Catholic Education; Catholic school; meaning of work; Teaching approaches | ABSTRACT: This study uncovers the meanings that secondary teachers working under the religious structure of Jesuit institutions attach to their work. I draw on theoretical insights coming from organisational behaviour. I use cases of teachers who worked or work in Catholic high schools run by the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuit order. I interviewed 105 teachers, lay and Jesuit priests, who teach in the United States, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. The findings reveal that the participating teachers create meaning of their work using the building blocks of the self, others, the work context, and the spiritual life and that Teachers in the study showed a relatively similar pattern of making meaning in their work using four sources of meaning: others, the work context, the self, and spiritual life. There is no evidence that neither the professional status (being a Jesuit teacher or a lay teacher) nor the geographical setting of the teachers, mark a difference within the different meanings attributed to being a teacher in this particular educational context."

A project that provides history teachers of elite schools in Chile with firsthand contact with history teachers in an intercultural school in the Araucanía. This region is the conflict zone with higher levels of violence between the Mapuche and the Chilean State. The pilot study analyzes the perceptions of the students of elite schools in the city’s capital–Santiago–about the Mapuche and the present-day conflict, before and after their history teachers participated in the Kuykuitin project."

I present a frame to broadly understand how, historically speaking, the concept of calling moved from a theocentric understanding to a post-secular one. Then, I show that research on callings has focused on the relationship that they have with the work and the workplace. Finally, I apply the analysis above on the calling to teaching."

Using data from the 2013 Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), I question whether extrinsic and intrinsic elements of school organizations, in addition to teachers’ personal attributes, are associated with their dissatisfaction. Using multiple logistic regression, I found that Mexico is the country where teachers have the least likelihood of being dissatisfied compared with both Chile and Brazil. In agreement with the literature, I also found that collaboration among teachers and a culture of participation in the school are key characteristics associated with less dissatisfied teachers."

A required preamble to understanding his influence on the chilean educational system 1950-2010 | KEYWORDS: Chilean educational system; Indivisible freedom; Milton friedman; Vouchers | ABSTRACT: The Chilean education system, it is often argued, radically changed in the years after 1980 because of the influence of the economic thought of Milton Friedman. Here, I explore Friedman's notion of indivisible freedom and its practical application in Chile through the economist's direct involvement with the regime and the reforms, particularly with the implementation of vouchers in education. I argue that a detailed assessment of Friedman's relationship with Chile reveals more nuances to his concept of indivisible freedom. I rely on data obtained from (1) The Milton Friedman Papers, 1912-2006, Hoover Institution Archives; (2) University of Chicago, Office of the President. Wilson Administration, Records, University of Chicago Special Collections; (3) The Chicago Maroon; (4) The New York Times; and (5) The Youth Spartacus. In addition to a different perspective on Friedman's involvement in Chile, complementary/ alternative explanations to the implementation of vouchers in Chile are provided."
1538,0,"TITLE: 50 years of the declaration on christian education gravissimum educationis: A review of its reception in Latin America | KEYWORDS: Gravissimum educationis; Latin American church; Liberating education | ABSTRACT: This article presents an historical and critical review of the Declaration on Christian Education Gravissimum Educationis, promulgated on October 28, 1965, during the fourth and last session of Vatican II. By considering the history and context of this document, and after evaluating the three socio-ecclesial factors that were behind the text, an assessment of the reception of Gravissimum Educationis principles in the Latin American Church is made. The Conference of Bishops at Medellı´n in 1968 rejected many points of Gravissimum Educationis. In 1979, the Third General Conference at Puebla proposed a new concept of education for the continent. The bishops considered that education has to be, first of all, an evangelizing task. By analyzing the state of education in the continent, the Fifth Conference at Aparecida also criticizes trends that impoverished the real purpose of education in the continent. The article concludes that both the content and the history behind Gravissimum Educationis make this declaration of Vatican II a lesser document in comparison to other conciliar documents such as Gaudium et spes or Lumen gentium. Even though the Declaration introduces some principles of education and schooling, these are presented in a defensive form, precisely a form that other main conciliar documents try to avoid. For these reasons, Gravissimum Educationis was not well-received in Latin America."

It does this by exploring the nuances of the interplay between teaching evaluations as formative and summative, the use of procedures, tools, and artifacts obligated by the local Teacher Incentive Fund system, and bonus payments as extrinsic motivators. Research Methods: The study is a qualitative longitudinal study in three public charter schools that were selected as a presumably conducive environment for incentive-driven performance management. Eight rounds of semistructured interviews, 130 interviews, and 65 hours of meeting observations are the data for this study. Findings: In the three charter schools, the adoption period was characterized by consonance, the belief that the performance management system served valued purposes. In midlife, dissonance set in. Performance contingencies attached to both bonus and external evaluations were perceived as disconfirming the values of the schools. Incentives and status competition were largely rebuffed and relegated to the periphery. Once the power of incentives became latent, a period of resonance set in. Administrators and teachers came to interact with the two main artifacts, videos of lessons and the Summative Evaluation of Teaching observation tool, in ways that afforded new learning. Implications for Research and Practice: The study suggests that research insights can be gained when logics of complex performance management systems are disentangled and competing dynamics deliberately studied. Practically speaking, when schools try to maintain a rich collegial culture, incentives may crowd out the use of teaching evaluations for formative learning."

Both types of changes created a new structure for the relationship of different elements within the church and between the church and the world. This was not the first time the Catholic leadership redefined its relationship with the secular world–to agree in eliminating the pontifical states in the First Vatican Council in 1870 is one example–but is the first time that an internal change promoted such a positive relationship with the world. The church understood both (1) that she could collaborate in the well-being of the world, and also (2) that she could find many things for her own well-being in the secular world (LG 44). The idea of a self-contained organisation in opposition to the world was over with the advent of the Vatican II."

Here I will present a lesser known face of Freire that I claim is as important as his humanist inspiration: his Catholic background. As a first step, I will present some aspects of Freire's religious experience. Then, I will highlight two aspects of his educational theory showing the connections with his Christian background: the theology of communion in relation to his concept of humanity and the application of the theological virtues as the basis for his concept of dialogue, which, as was shown, are the bases of his educational theory. Finally, I will explore some aspects of the ecclesiology that he was taught and which he later criticised. This research fills not only a gap in Freire's interpretation, but it is also a source of motivation for Catholic educators; those who educate from their beliefs."

Based on the data from the Parental Survey 2006 (n= 188.073), completed by Chile's Ministry of Education, this article describes the reasons parents mention for choosing their children's school, and the schools' criteria for selecting students. The conclusion is that Catholic schools are the most selective and usually exceed the parents' capacity of selection. One reason to select students would be the direct relation between this practice and higher average scores on the test administered by the System of Measuring Quality in Education."
1543,0,"TITLE: The curriculum of Frankenstein: or the education of a monster | KEYWORDS: curriculum theory; educational research; hermeneutics; Literary study | ABSTRACT: In this literary study essay, I ask what might be revealed to us when rereading Frankenstein from a reconceptualized perspective of curriculum, a perspective sensitive to the educational lived experience of the human person. To do this, I provide commentary on key passages along the novel, focusing on three salient features that emerge from that hermeneutical reading: the existential aspect of becoming (and its inherent sense of solitude, alienation, but also hope), the need for transcending mere being and becoming, aspiring to not only fulfilment but also goodness, and the caution that however carefully planned, the educational process of becoming can go wrong, including tragic consequences. Positioned within a reconceptualist tradition of curriculum, the analysis presented here presents a cautionary tale about overemphasizing a single aspect in educational experience, such as cognitive competencies, skills or political stances, while neglecting a relation to ethics, morals, attunement to self and other, and what makes us more fully human. Methodologically, the essay shows a concrete example of a literary study as educational research."

1545,2,"TITLE: The curriculum of the plague | KEYWORDS: Coronavirus; Curriculum; Education; Existentialism; Pandemic; Plague | ABSTRACT: The Covid-19 pandemic can be read as an eruption of the Real: a traumatic event that overwhelms our capacity for symbolization and exposes the fragility of the imaginary. Albert Camus addresses this traumatic dimension in his 1947 novel The Plague, in which he reserves a rather puzzling statement for the closing paragraph: A plague never disappears, he wrote, but can lie dormant only to reappear once again “for the education of men”. What lessons can be learned from the pandemic we are experiencing right now? While Covid-19 is often discussed from a biological perspective, the magnitude of the tragedy raises questions far beyond the confines of the natural/medical sciences, questions about humanity, our limits and possibilities, and the transcendent. This article explores the potential educational aspect of the pandemic by framing the discussion in an exegetical reading of Camus’ novel. Through this reading, it claims that even within the tragic reality of its effects, the present pandemic might bring to the fore the notion of an existential kind of learning—one that is deeply personal, that cannot be programmed or learned from direct teaching, and that connects us in relevant ways to the lives of others. At the same time, this reading is not oblivious to the practical needs around decision-making on the part of educational policymakers, administrators, and teachers. As the novel shows, tragic events create a demand for quick action, so a few practical principles for curriculum decision-making are also offered."

In this work, the author presents the main theories of curriculum in the current discourse, develops a notion of critique, and applies it to existing global guidelines for curriculum reform. Relying on the architectonic of the subject as developed across the work of Jacques Lacan—expressed in the registers of the Symbolic, the Imaginary, and the Real—the author provides a new approach to understanding curriculum in terms of the psychic dynamics that explain its workings."
1548,0,"TITLE: Ideology, curriculum & the self: The psychic rootedness of ideology and resistance in subjectivity | KEYWORDS: Curriculum; Ideology; Subjectivity; Unconscious | ABSTRACT: One of the guiding questions in this discussion is how is it that certain ideologies become so ingrained and resistant to challenge and scrutiny? The central assumptions sustaining the argument conceive curriculum -the backbone of educational practice- to be an expression of ideological activity; the understanding of ideology as lived experience; and subjectivity as a site of ideology mediated by language. By drawing on curricular and psychoanalytic theory, in this paper I claim that the ideological content gets established through curricular practices not only at the cognitive and conscious level of knowledge and disciplinary subject-matter contents, but rather - and more decisively-at the unconscious level of the construction of subjectivity through psychic processes mediated by language. The paper is an attempt to sketch a preliminary understanding of the processes that result in ideological positionings that challenge scrutiny and contestation, by exploring their rootedness in desire and the psychic formation of the self."

Bringing together domestic and international advertising and voyage accounts, we assess how the Juan Fernández Islands were incorporated into both Chilean and foreign tourist discourses as an idealised paradise. We highlight how cruise ship tourism marketing rebranded these islands as a ‘romantic’ and exotic destination, reinforcing colonial ideas of isolation and remoteness. In so doing, we underline how cruise tourism facilitated new forms of engagement with the island environment that were distinct from the islanders’ aquapelagic relationality at the interface of water and land. We also showcase how the tourist industry exacerbated the exploitation and commodification of the islands’ natural environment, developing a cultural identity for Juan Fernández that also saw the renegotiation of their place in Chilean national identity, thus contributing to the history of small islands and their modern cultural representations."

The methodology corresponds to a qualitative multiple case study, with a sample of five students from the Law degree at the Universidad Católica de Chile. First, a semi-structured interview was conducted to determine the strategies declared by the students when writing demands. Subsequently, the writing of a demand by each student was recorded with the Camtasia program. From this, a comparison was made between the declared strategies and those actually carried out to establish the level of consciousness of the subjects. Among the results, it was obtained that students who had greater awareness had a higher grade than students who were less aware of what they were doing, which was closely related to the strategies that were explicitly taught in classes versus those that were not. Thus, the need for interdisciplinary teaching is proposed, in which there is joint work between the disciplinary teacher and the writing teacher, in order to explain in detail to students the functioning of the production processes when writing legal texts."

In this context, the present study, framed in the field of academic and disciplinary literacy, gives an account, first, of the process and the product of the description of the solemn oral genre, based on tools of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and of the ethnographic approach. As a second result, this research analyzes the students' perception of an intensive writing and orality course, anchored in the curriculum of the Law degree in a traditional Chilean university, on the transfer of learning of solemn oral genre to other instances of the career. The conclusions include the relevance of interdisciplinary work for the purposes of disciplinary literacy actions, as well as the scope of the description of genres of a particular academic community for educational purposes."

The space was described mainly the system without coordinates, through linguistic deictics and gestures referred to the framework. The system with coordinates had less presence in the reports. The intrinsic spatial frame of reference was the majority in both groups, due to the implications of the task, although there were more absolute references in Mapuche students. The results indicate a gap in the group in the acquisition of more complex notions and spatial concepts linguistic, according to a geocentric and egocentric abstraction. The relation of everyday experiences and sensory information with the linguistic and gestural description of space is discussed, as well as factors of variability in representations and preference for spatial reference frames between speakers."
1553,-1,"TITLE: Caring for a Responsible Self: Migrant Motherhood and the Politics of Reproduction | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: For Haitian women who live and work in Santiago, expecting a baby entitled to Chilean nationality involves recognizing their maternal bodies at different institutional levels and transforming who they are and how they care for themselves and others as migrants, workers, and mothers in a new country. Based on ethnographic research, this article examines how the pregnant body’s moral legitimacy generates a form of agency among racialized migrant workers who become mothers. Pregnant migrants’ sense of self as working mothers and migrant workers emerges from their embodiment of institutional discourses of self-responsibility and self-care as they navigate contradictory forms of recognition and belonging to the global economy and the nation’s reproduction. The experience of migrant motherhood exposes the lived contradictions inherent in the gendered politics of reproduction. By grounding the meanings of care and social reproduction in migrant selfhood, this analysis expands on the scholarship of gendered migration, and reproductive and care labor, across unequal registers of migrant and nonmigrant livelihoods."

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with migrant Haitian women apply-ing for work visas in Santiago, this article explores the effects of desired formality and its promises of a good life on contemporary statehood in Chile. The analysis shows how Haitian women’s efforts to become formal workers transform their experiences as racialized and gendered migrants in Chile, and impact how state institutions manage and control migration. Desired formality reveals the paradoxical character of state policies that help create a racialized and precarious labor force within its legal frameworks and explain why migrants attach themselves to fragile good-life projects in new countries."

Drawing on ethnographic research, I show how racialized differences are made material and emotional based on a particular history of white supremacy and mestizaje. I argue that to become appropriate and hirable workers in the service economy, Haitian women transform their appearance, movements, feelings, and attitudes according to white pedagogies of affective labor. I show how the skilling of labor performed through these pedagogies is deeply affective, shaping Haitian women's sense of worth and their self-constitution as migrants beyond labor encounters. The analysis of how anti-Black racism toward migrant women perpetuates local manifestations of white-mestizo privilege reveals how affective labor and racialization practices articulate intimate experiences of transnational mobility with intersectional scripts of power."

It is suggested that new research opportunities are also obtained from the articulation between SE and EE, with those on the factors that affect the development of the key competencies outlined by Wiek et al. (2011) being particularly relevant. In order to verify this proposal, quantitative methodologies were used, which investigate the concepts of socio-scientific controversies and the relative degree of deployment of key competencies for sustainability. In order to achieve this, the BIOHEAD-citizen questionnaire and a case study test evaluated with rubrics were applied to trainee teachers to collect evidence of conceptions of controversies in various topics and the relative degree of development of three competencies, namely, systems-thinking, strategic, and normative competencies. The association of both sets of data was done with linear models, based on the score for each competency as a dependent variable. The best model obtained shows a statistically significant explanation of systems-thinking on the part of two systems of conceptions: socio-environmentally negative and socio-political religious; whereas for the other two competencies (strategic and normative) no independent variable resulted in a relevant model. These results suggest that conceptions are important for the development of key competencies, supporting the importance of a symbiotic relationship between SE and EE, the’implications of which are discussed for ITT."

Looking for ways to reconfigure the role of teachers, it is pertinent to investigate the instances of interaction between students, with the participation of teachers, occurring in school within nonformal educational activities. Using conversational analysis strategies, we studied the interactions between a group of students and a teacher during their work meetings in an online television production project, as an extracurricular activity of voluntary participation. The results show that this experience generates a dynamic of openness and flexibility that makes possible the active and critical participation of students. Nevertheless, we also found that for the teaching figure, the role of promoter and head of the activity persists while being challenged by student participation."

Nonetheless, there is always a chance that a significant seismic interaction between nearby buildings through the underlying soil will occur in big urban areas with high building densities. This paper evaluates the Site-City interaction (SCI) between different city block arrangements under seismic excitation given different parameters of the buildings and centre-to-centre interbuilding distances. A database of strong ground motion records with Far-Field, Near-Field Without Pulse and Near-Field Pulse-Like characteristics are employed. The results suggest that the SCI effects were strongly influenced by the building properties and resonance effects of the soil stratum. Furthermore, as a mean for all the earthquakes considered here, the SCI can amplify or reduce the seismic response of the buildings, depending on the relative position between the city blocks."

Liderazgo Escolar en Tiempos de Crisis | KEYWORDS: Crisis; Distance education; Leadership; Management; Opportunity | ABSTRACT: The educational crisis derived from the pandemic and the limited national research on educational leadership in crisis lend us to identify examples of school leadership practices in times of crisis that allowed schools to survive -and even improve- during the Covid-19 Pandemic and Post-Pandemic. The methodology was qualitative, based on 30 semi-structured interviews with directors and teachers at Chilean schools and high schools. Results show the emergence of practices aiming to continue teaching-learning processes, to prioritize the community welfare, to make critical decisions, to have assertive communication, to be flexible, to incentive discussion about the crisis and to distribute leaderships. We conclude that there is a link among the different practices that must be recognized to move towards a more comprehensive approach to educational improvement, while at the same time, academia and public policy are invited to change the paradigm to understand crises as periodic events that involve studying and strengthen leadership that will allow us to face them in the future."

This study attempts to understand how an educational innovation opens up new spaces of identity configuration within a school and how students and teachers produce meanings by participating in it. To do so, we present a case study from the Interdisciplinary School Research Program about a school named Sagrados Corazones de Manquehue, based on semi-structured interviews with the actors involved in this project and an analytic approach drawing from grounded theory. Our findings show that innovation can configure a space in which new identities are produced through emergent discourses, practices, and external acknowledgement. At the same time, this new space impacts both the students' self-knowledge and the teachers' professional development, and furthers a strong sense of community among the members of the program. However, it also implies a constant risk of reproducing some of the excluding dynamics of the school."

Concepciones sobre innovación educativa. ¿qué significa para los docentes en Chile? | KEYWORDS: Educational change; Educational innovation; Semantics; Teachers | ABSTRACT: Knowledge society, new reforms and a growing social demand for better schools have led to an increasing need for Educative Innovation. In this context, is relevant to explore what teachers understand by innovation. The main objective of this article is to describe how teachers in Chile understand the concept of Educative Innovation. To do this, qualitative methods were used. Structured interviews were conducted, and the responses were analyzed inductively. The analysis was complemented later with a deductive phase in which semi-structured interviews were conducted to a group of teachers. The findings were finally countered with the meanings found on literature review. Results showed that Educative Innovation is not a univocal term. Nevertheless, Chilean teachers mostly associate it with curricular changes aimed to improve and necessary to comply with the times and new students. Besides, they conceive those changes as isolated alterations, without formal processes of critique or institutionalization. Results suggest also that teachers conceive educational innovation from a practical-reflexive paradigm. However, they feel conditioned by a system that is recently overcoming a technological paradigm."

The results question previous evidence about a common repertoire of effective leadership practices and suggest that local context will affect the type of leadership that is required for a specific educational system to improve, and therefore the definition of principals’ effective practices. For Chile, the article points out that the principals’ leadership practices that contribute the most to improve teacher performance are those related to ensuring that teachers’ work and professional development are in accordance with the teaching goals of the school, as well as monitoring student work and classroom activities. Nevertheless, Chilean principals are more likely to get involved in the former practices (related to the school teaching goals) than in those related to teachers’ work in the classroom, resulting in their actions being more powerful in mobilizing teachers’ attitudes and professional practices than their teaching, which reduces their potential to promote teachers’ performance. The results have implications for educational leadership research and policy making, especially in non-Anglo-American countries."

El Caso de dos Liceos del Centro Sur de Chile después del 27F | KEYWORDS: Crisis; Distributed leadership; Internal communication; Participation; School leadership | ABSTRACT: This paper aims to identify effective school leadership and management practices during a crisis period. We define crisis as a change of great intensity which produces a school operation imbalance within the organization and with its surrounding environment. We are particularly concerned about those practices that allow coping with the context of adversity and keeping normal operation. In order to identify those practices, we conducted a case study of two high schools that were highly affected by the Chilean massive earthquake on February 2010, the sixth largest in the world ever recorded. These schools were monitored for four years using mixed methods, including interviews, focus groups, surveys, projective techniques and secondary information review. As a result, we identify three main effective strategies: a) ensuring a focus on pedagogy despite all the other concerns; b) empowering others to distribute leadership and spread the school community support, promoting wider participation of the entire school community including parents and students; and c) ensuring permanent formal communication to the entire community in order to reduce anxiety and avoid misunderstandings. Additionally, when available, it is important to be open for external support despite the risk of showing internal weaknesses."

Yet, there is scarce evidence on how young people navigate the challenges presented by climate change using their personal strengths and the resources accessible to them. This study aimed to address this gap by drawing on qualitative data from workshops with 31 young people between 12 and 22 years of age from metropolitan Melbourne and a bushfire-risk region in Victoria, Australia. An inductive thematic analysis of workshop transcripts showed that participants had progressively become aware of climate change in an increasingly uncertain world and sought to gain a sense of connection, agency, and hope. Participants aimed to achieve the latter by becoming aware of opportunities for climate actions in everyday life and developing themselves as agents of change. We discussed our findings from a developmental perspective to gain a better understanding of how supporting young people in learning about and acting on climate change can benefit their mental health and sense of agency."

A significant, though often neglected consequence is how many children are impacted by these tragic events. In such challenging circumstances, children need stability, continuity and trusted people they can rely on for support. This paper aims to understand how best to provide school-based support for children following parental IPH by investigating the experiences of affected children, their caregivers and professionals with experience of working with these children. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 35 participants in Australia, the UK and Ireland (11 with lived experience, 12 caregivers and 12 professionals). We developed two key themes through the data analysis process: (1) School as a supportive place and (2) Limited access to a trusted, supportive adult at school. We found that schools can potentially be supportive, safe, stable, and consistent places for affected children, and teachers and counsellors can help provide trusted, supportive relationships for them; however, there needs to be effective resourcing within an overall policy structure. Schools are in a strategic position to identify the effects of trauma in the children’s lives and can also provide a valuable link between children and relevant specialist services. There are limitations, however, regarding both the accessibility and availability of suitable skilled and experienced practitioners who can support the children, their caregivers, and school staff. Ongoing care teams need to be established to provide the comprehensive, individualised services these children need."

Method: The study draws on in-depth interviews from three different informants: those with lived experience (LE) (10); caregivers (12); and professionals (10). In addition to the 10 interviews with those bereaved by maternal IPH, experiences discussed include a further 23 cases of bereavement due to IPH during childhood (when aged under 18). We used thematic analysis to code and extracted themes into the relevant five dimensions of the socio-ecological model. Results: The circumstances in which the homicide/suicide took place, were crucial in shaping children’s life trajectory. We identified circumstantial predictors in branching of trajectories: witnessing the murder; relatedness to perpetrator; and assumptions on biological relatedness. We found the need for life-long access to therapeutic care to support CYP essential during various developmental stages and life transitions. We recognized that both kinship and foster carers, required support in dealing with the complexity of grieving children. For kinship care, carers require help in managing their own grief, in addition to financial support to account for the new caring responsibilities. We also observed that children’s voice was rarely elicited, with no opportunities to exercise their agency. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of contextual circumstances for tailored support and the identification of appropriate carers and supporting them holistically. Finally, we highlight the importance of child centered policies and dedicated resources to support relevant services dealing with CYP bereaved by parental IPH."

This study investigated the experiences of young people and adults bereaved by parental intimate partner homicide during childhood, to gain a better understanding of how they make sense of and share their personal story after such a loss. Methods: Within the context of a larger study, we conducted twelve semi-structured interviews with people with lived experience of such deaths in Australia and used narrative analysis to interpret the data. Results: Participants were frequently confronted with imposed narratives (i.e., from family, practitioners, peers) about the homicide, their parents, and their own identities, leading to a deep sense of loneliness and feeling misunderstood, powerless, and silenced. In various ways, participants resisted imposed narratives and took control over their stories. This process was difficult but could lead to improved and more authentic relationships with oneself, family, and others. In this way, participants used their experiences to transform themselves and others, sometimes by becoming advocates or practitioners supporting others with similar experiences. Conclusions: We named this process of taking control of one’s story “crafting subverses.” It involved making sense of and sharing experiences of trauma and grief for personal healing and social justice. Helping children craft their “subverses” may be an important aspect of gaining a deeper understanding of how to support them. Provision of carefully tailored peer mentoring, professional support and opportunities to influence programs and policy appear key to better support systems for those bereaved due to parental intimate partner homicide."

However, grand narratives and power relationships in academia inherited from colonialism and imperialism can threaten to obstruct the transformative value of this approach. In this article, we present the case of Think Big, a multinational collaboration for participatory research with children that involved adult and child coresearchers from Australia, Chile, Colombia, and the United Kingdom. Our aim was to explore how this project helped build solidarities between adult researchers from different countries and disciplines. We applied a methodology of diffraction to explore the processes and outcomes of this collaboration and presented our insights using the metaphor of a tree to explain the roots (knowledges and frameworks), trunk (ongoing collaboration and communication between the teams from different countries), branches (local projects), and fruits (research outcomes) of our work. Based on our experience, we proposed that multinational collaborations for participatory research offer important opportunities for adult researchers to collaborate with children to generate more democratic knowledge about their lives and to generate more egalitarian relationships between adult researchers from different places and backgrounds. However, it is important to anticipate that multinational collaborations are more likely to be affected by social and political upheavals, and language barriers must be overcome to decentralize academia. Also, the organizations involved in these collaborations need to develop strategies that facilitate funding, ethics clearance, and international research agreements."

It comprises private subsidies, achievement incentives, competition, selection, and segregation. After years of student and social protests, the 2015 Inclusion Law mandated that publicly funded schools accept all admitted students. Critics argue this restricts family choice and undermines merit. The COVID-19 pandemic further deepened inequalities, exposing contradictions in a merit-based system. This article examines how meritocratic ideals emerged post-pandemic in parents’ and teachers’ perceptions of school communities within a neoliberal educational model promoting meritocratic values alongside inclusive policies. Based on 32 interviews with parents and teachers from two private and two publicly funded schools in Santiago, findings show meritocracy is deeply entrenched, even in public education. The “meritorious student” is defined beyond academics, encompassing behavior, responsibility, and respect—traits also expected of families. The importance of effort as a mechanism for improvement permeates the notion of the “good student”, thereby overshadowing the importance of inclusive educational environments, as merit also becomes relativised by the post-pandemic scenario. The deep educational inequalities and behavioural problems force teachers and parents to focus on and solve different aspects rather than academic achievements. Merit, as understood by educational communities, is perceived as a process and an attitude intertwined with social opportunities."

Using data from interviews with 36 parents and teachers of Chilean schoolchildren, we explore how parenting is performed in parents’ WhatsApp groups. This research is conducted from the approach of science and technology studies, as it allows us to focus on how everything/everyone has the potential to have the agency to affect and be affected by others. In our results we show that parenting within WhatsApp is performed by monitoring their children’s school agenda, comparing and competing with the performances of others, and portraying themselves as attentive parents. Through these comparisons, families engage in a form of lateral surveillance, contributing to the intensification of parenting. We discuss how this digital platform operates in an ambivalent manner, enabling caregiving to be exhibited as a manifestation of presence and availability, and as restlessness, intensity and demand."
1572,1,"TITLE: strategies to promote dignified and feminist academia: some collaborative reflections from Chile | KEYWORDS: academia; Chile; feminism; gender studies; social sciences; women researchers | ABSTRACT: During the COVID-19 pandemic, scholars around the world warned about increasing gender inequalities within academia. In this context, we created Red Feminista de las Ciencias Sociales to support initiatives among women researchers in Chile. Our objective is to appeal for gender equality in academia and to promote structural changes that guarantee dignified feminist academia in the social sciences. This article draws on various self-training and discussion activities developed by the Red Feminista between mid-2021 and mid-2022 to discuss the role of women in academia, with implications for other marginalised groups in Chile and possibly other countries where inequality in academia is also a reality. Based on our discussions, we propose strategies to promote a decentralised, decolonised and feminist social science academia that guarantees gender equality as a fundamental human right and as a crosscutting axis in producing knowledge and access to it. We organise these strategies into four pillars: 1) equity and justice in the production of knowledge, 2) dignified work conditions in the production of knowledge, 3) a work environment free from harassment and 4) the democratisation of access to knowledge. Whilst these aspects have been studied in other countries, this article addresses the specific context of Chile. We argue that it is possible to reflect on feminisms (in plural) within academia and propose practical strategies for establishing new dynamics through collaborative work."

Problems and potentialities in experiences of temporality in school | KEYWORDS: justice; phenomenology; school; Temporality | ABSTRACT: This paper problematizes the experience of temporality in school education and explores its potentialities, examining the implications for educational justice in and for qualitative research. In a first stage, we develop a pars destruens of how the experience of temporality takes place as a transversal dimension of school activities. Using phenomenological perspective as theoretical and critical lens, we show that the objective of this approach is to organize time and experience in a standardized, contradictory, and tense manner; at the same time, we describe a pars construens of the experience of temporality, endowed with a horizon of possibilities: the school as free time that contributes to questioning certain aspects in relation to temporality as a project of progress in education, without failures, without different rhythms. These approaches propose a link between experience of temporality and educational justice that we discuss in the conclusion."
1574,0,"TITLE: Acceleration in School Time: Issues of Educational Justice Between the Use of Digital Technology and the Idea of Skholé | KEYWORDS: Acceleration; Digital communicational technologies; Educational justice; Skholè-school time | ABSTRACT: In this chapter, we problematise the connection between the experience of temporality in school and educational justice in the context of the acceleration and proliferation of technology use. Our problematization takes place in three stages. In the first, we conduct a recap and delve into the etymological meaning of school, which is based on the word skholè (σχoλ ´η), which denotes free or leisure time. Free time would be a time not yet claimed or determined by society, which implies that education involves giving the new generation a fair chance at their existence as subjects. We then problematise this meaning by introducing communicational tech-nology into the school context and considering the acceleration of time. Using data from a three-year project about the use of communicational technology in Chilean schools, we demonstrate that even though the introduction of technologies and the acceleration of time can facilitate processes and improve communication between families and schools, it does not allow the deployment of different ways of being a teacher and parent, constructing a panorama of injustice. In the final stage, we assert that considering freedom and the suspension of time as a fair chance for our existence as subjects does not mean divesting ourselves of what we are as students, teachers or parents, but rather, it involves embracing the multiplicity of what we represent with regard to this time in school. We propose that this could be a way to break away from the acceleration discussed in the second section."

Background: The literature on the use of these groups and platforms for online communication has contended that teachers and parents feel that they are under constant surveillance when they are using them. The advantages and disadvantages of these platforms are presented, as well as recommendations for good practices. Method: Qualitative analysis of two WhatsApp chats of parents from two schools in Chile, one public and one private, using a grounded theory approach. Results: Using a theoretical framework of science, technology, and society studies, we examine the particularities of this surveillance observed in three dimensions: conflicts as smoke bombs, operational surveillance, and affective surveillance. In this respect, we argue that in these groups, intimate surveillance leads to the normalization of certain behaviors that cause conflict to be silenced. Conclusion: We argue that silencing of conflict is problematic in that it does not allow the emergence of different ways of being a teacher or parent, which has significant consequences for families and their relationship with the school, especially in locations similar to the one we studied, where communication between families and schools has relied heavily on messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Implications: WhatsApp groups appear to offer opportunities to subvert the surveillance of digital platforms, as long as conflicts are allowed to be sustained when differences emerge."

This research focuses on the emergence of maternal digital markets in 56 Instagram accounts in Chile. Using tools from digital ethnography, narrative analysis, and visual analysis, we explore the composition of images and text content to elucidate the ways in which the legitimacy journey –from experience to the offer of different products, workshops or general advice on parenting and care– mobilizes affects and normative ideals about good motherhood. The results suggest that the assemblage of algorithms, affects, and norms produces specific ideas about motherhood in interaction with users, thus shaping a mechanism of consumer surveillance. The analysis of the normative movement shows a discourse based on wanting, transforming motherhood into a project of self-construction, while affects are sustained by the promise of belonging and the mobilization of a sense of emotional and/or material lack."

This article explores the normative emergence of being a student, a parent, and a teacher in the use of parents’ WhatsApp groups. In Chile, this digital application is widely used by the population, and it is particularly important for school communities. Based on interviews conducted with teachers and parents, and a theoretical approach based on science and technology studies, the results show that students are constantly labeled as “good” or “bad” without nuance, which produces stereotypes, and parents are also labeled in a binary way, with one group of alarmists and one of relaxed parents, where counter criticisms emerge, while teachers are seen as an extension of the schools and are expected to be constantly present. Digital communication technologies mediate these interactions and open up a new level of interaction, with standards and meanings enabled by the features of the application. We discuss these results, emphasizing that the normativities of these becomings are intertwined in the digital sphere, and using a mapping visualization of the analysis, we show how normativity acts ubiquitously and produces constantly changing expectations of how one should be for those in the group. The mapping exercise shows that the main relationship between the three becomings is emotion, so we conclude that, on the understanding that affect exceeds individuality and represents intensities online, normativities are also incorporated as affective responses in the parents’ WhatsApp group."

Using Gewirtz's multidimensional model of justice and the frame of socially just pedagogies, we analyse the case of Oscar, a father of a child with Down Syndrome, who is looking for a school for his son. The case develops in the Chilean educational system context, which is known by its neoliberal policy frame and its highly stratified structure. For this reason, a new inclusion law and, specifically, a new school admission system were implemented in 2015 and 2017 respectively, to generate a fairer and more equal school admission policy frame. Therefore, our theoretical proposi-tion has practical implications, in policy terms, and analytical ones. We propose to add two dimensions of educational justice at the time we analyse Oscar’s case: first, educational justice must embrace injustices that are not necessarily experienced in formal educational spaces; we call this the multi-spatiality dimension of justice. Second, we propose a multi-temporality analysis of educational justice, one that considers, as socially just pedagogies have established, a focus on the future. In this case the educational policy and discourse promotes a pre-established and normalised future for children, one that is problematic for children with disabilities, whose parents, like Oscar, have a more urgent focus on the present."

One of the main features of data visualization is that it would allow placing the information on a human scale, which would make comparing cases a more plausible process to perform. In this sense, this article hopes to show the usefulness of the visualization of qualitative data based on the comparison of four biographical lines of chemistry academics of a Chilean university. We use a particular definition of academic trajectory, namely, the overlap of work, family, personal and couple aspects that are developed in the academic context. With this definition as a starting point, these timelines were articulated with the academic narrative biographies. The use of colors, symbols according to the event, and quotes from the interviews in each of the events within the biographical lines, allow us to realize that, in the case of men, work trajectory follows a progressive linearity and it distanced from the trajectory family. On the contrary, for women work trajectory is put into evaluation and stressed regarding the family trajectory. Thus, we concluded that the visualization of the timelines is a flexible tool because it can act as a memory aid to the interviewees during fieldwork. Besides, it allows to account for subjective aspects to be analyzed, to make comparisons, and to show the information amiably for the audience and research groups."

In this sense, we argue that the processes of classification (in terms of social class), racialisation and genderisation that migrant Latin families experience when choosing schools for their children in the Chilean context can be a form of this coloniality. To make our case, we use narratives from in-depth interviews conducted in Valparaíso with migrant families who applied to schools under the new admission system. In this sense, narratives show that the processes of classification, racialisation and genderisation, as socio-cultural productions, intersect with migrant families’ school-choice experiences. These intersections emerge when families match school choices with an shelter search, as they manifest their interests to protect their children, avoiding schools with ‘marginal children’ or racial bullying and safeguarding gender expectations."

In Chile, during the eighties, this perspective grew rapidly in order to ""lend voice to those without voice"": women, peasants and workers, among others. The article reviews the use of this approach in Chile, from a different social and political context, to contribute to the discussion of its pertinence and limitations for the emerging Social Sciences. The first part reviews the concepts, the schools of thought and the dimensions (ethical, ontological, epistemological and methodological); the second part examines what is being studied and how, and the treatment of the dimensions of time and change used in these studies. Finally, we contribute with an analysis of its limitations and benefits, in order to enhance and strengthen an approach that purports to include complexity in studies about subjectivity in Chile."

We hypothesize that the segregation of the Chilean school system generated a prestige order in which pupils are differentiated by status characteristics according to the type of school they attend, and that these evaluations are based on racial traits. To test this hypothesis, we study whether facial appearance is sufficient to impute the type of school a pupil is attending, and whether these categorizations evoke different status evaluations of wealth and morality based on race. Results confirm that participants’ perceptions of facial appearance allow them to situate pupils in the Chilean social structure. Faces categorized as studying at different types of schools varied in their perceived wealth. However, the relationship between moral traits and types of schools was weak. We also found evidence of racial bias in the participants’ perceptions of pupils’ faces: faces categorized as enrolled in municipal schools (low status) were judged with Amerindian or mestizo racial traits, while faces categorized as attending private fee-paying schools (high status) were judged with white racial traits. We did not find a relationship between race and morality."

Teacher education programs should incorporate global competence into curriculum designs, and music teacher education is no exception. This study aims to evaluate the suitability of a set of cross-cutting competencies for music education oriented toward global competence and human rights education. The research method used is a proof-of-concept, as the set of competencies will be appraised as an incipient product by academic staff members at various music teacher education programs from around Chile. The findings show the strengths of cross-cutting competencies, pertaining mostly to an intertwining of elements of disciplinarity, teaching, and research related to music and its education. Some weaknesses were also identified, including the high number of cross-cutting competencies proposed. The set has been validated by experts, allowing for its continued refinement and empirical application in other contexts linked to music teacher education."

The current study aims to explore music education inequities from the Chilean school system. The method is centered on multiple-case study design, focusing on three boundaries: the time, space, and place. The sample, which was chosen by criteria linked to maximum variation sampling, included participation from 30 music teachers. Results suggest that discrepancies in equitable opportunities are caused not only by the economic situation of schools, but are also provoked by Chile’s centralized educational model. In conclusion, some educators live on a darker side than others, but all music teachers are able to see the sun daily because they overcome inequities. Some implications are proposed."
1586,23,"TITLE: Capital and music education: Analysis from controversy Capital y educación musical: Análisis desde la controversia | KEYWORDS: Capitalism; Cultural Capital; Ecology-World Framework; Power Relationships; Social Structures | ABSTRACT: Capital is understood as material and symbolic elements that people value and accumulate, leading to social gaps because capital is not accumulated fairly and equitably in the population. The present study aims to analyse musical and sociomusical capital from the visions of capitalism and the Capitalocene, as they are based on the accumulation of all kinds of capital. In this regard, a deductive analysis is carried out from the constant comparative method, which implies processes of categorisation and codification. Results display that music education is conceived as a producer and product of capitalism, as it has developed from private property, means of production and profit as a commercial incentive. It affects ecosystems concurrently, as the raw materials for musical activities are collected from nature. It is concluded that capitalism in music is not bad per se, as musical practices bring innumerable benefits to the development of the human personality and community life. However, there are also social losses because the systemic structure gives rise to inequalities, stereotypes and violence. Theoretical implications are presented that would serve to deepen the analysis."

In this study, we explore didactic transposition implemented in music lessons from the perspective of didactical suitability. Utilising Design-Based Research, the current study collected qualitative and quantitative data from three urban schools in the Chartered Community of Navarre, Spain. Findings reveal that didactic transposition depends on the teacher’s beliefs because, while one-to-one teaching and academicism are preferred by educators who prioritise music theory, collective teaching and creativity are promoted by teachers who favour holistic development. In conclusion, didactic transposition enables the aspiration to didactical suitability, explaining the characteristics of didactic contracts. Lastly, some pedagogical implications are provided."

The current study aims to observe the influence of social groups in the construction of sociomusical identity, using a simple random sample comprised of 417 students who attend Chilean schools classified in a condition of social vulnerability. The chosen nonexperimental quantitative method is survey research, as two scales were applied to measure musical activities in different social groups. Results indicated that the musical performance variable explains social differences in the distribution of sociomusical capital because, just as Western culture fosters the musician-listener dualism, it also causes gaps in sociomusical identity. In conclusion, differentiation points in sociomusical identity are linked to social matters concerning musical performance, as school-goers’ musical practice is not encouraged inside nor outside of schools."

Hence, the current study aims to explore the vision of Music teachers regarding the implementation of the gender perspective in boys-only schools. The constant comparative method is used deductively, as the theoretical framework helped to establish conceptual categories. The sample comprises two female Music teachers who have participated individually and privately in a semi-structured interview to delve into teaching tasks applied in boys-only schools. Findings reveal the existence of a patriarchal ideology in music education, which is influenced by five dimensions: androcentric culture, musical stereotypes, emotional stereotypes, misogyny, and homophobia. In conclusion, the music industry nurtures and contaminates music education because androcentric culture emerges there."

Relevant research literature is analyzed without the intention of achieving a theoretical universality regarding the effects of neoliberalism on music education. The article reveals that neoliberalism has negatively influenced Chilean music education in at least five areas: facilities and provisions, curricular conception and delivery, professionalism, social segregation justified on the basis of the constitutional right of academic freedom, and an individualistic mindset. It concludes with an argument asserting that Chile is in need of a new social paradigm because the identified neoliberal patterns were found to have extraordinarily negative effects not only in education, but in other public services. International implications are suggested."

Teaching practices in child-youth orchestras establish no difference with other educational settings because teacher beliefs are based on teaching styles applied mainly in conservatoires and professional schools of music. The objective of the present study is focused on exploring teacher beliefs that influence on inclusive practices, analysing to a group of instrumental instructors who participate in an orchestral project implemented within a public school. The method entails a nonexperimental qualitative design, given that the selected case is only analysed through observations and interviews. Results display teacher beliefs are focused on providing a secure milieu, where students feel free for giving opinions and practising the singing in order to internalise instrumental melodies. In conclusion, instructors provide sociomusical spaces for reflecting on and discussing issues linked to musical performances and repertoires, given that students have the autonomy for expressing opinions and emotions in a secure milieu."

A nonexperimental quantitative research design was utilised in this study because two psychological scales have been applied, considering a random cluster sample, which is understood as a probability sampling because the number of participants has representativeness in the Spanish primary education system. Results demonstrate that music teachers work alone at schools, such that they have limited chances for interacting with other music educators at the workplace. In conclusion, job isolation is the turning point for understanding the motivational status of music teachers, at least in Spain.

In this study, we will explore music teacher motivation in classroom settings, collecting data from three educators through psychological scales, lesson observations and personal interviews. Results indicate that teacher motivation in classroom settings is affected by five internal and five external factors. Therefore, the study allows concluding that teacher motivation is also satisfied or thwarted by ideas that school members have about music education. Some practical implications are suggested."

The current study aims to understand music education in South American from 'Buen Vivir' to find decolonial pedagogies in a colonized territory, using the constant comparative method through procedures of categorization and coding in order to propose the plausibility of an emergent theory. Findings reveal three colonial models: 1) the Tridentine model implemented in conquest times represents the opposite side to 'Buen Vivir,' 2) the conservatory model provokes a spiritual crisis when faith is confronted with reason, and 3) the praxialism, which is seen as a colonial gatopardism (superficial change). From decolonialism, the musicking resonates with the sociomusical approach, favouring participation and construction of the sociomusical identity. We conclude that pedagogies based on 'Buen Vivir' may cure communal, intercultural, environmental, and spiritual relationships, both in natives and mestizo people from South America, as those sociomusical relationships serve as nutrients for personal and collective identity."

This research holds a qualitative, nonexperimental, and cross-sectional design, utilising it the constant comparative method in an inductive order for collecting and analysing data. The purposive sample is integrated by two teachers specializing in music education who have a vast experience in primary schools. Results display that control of musical and pedagogical competencies are essential for solving teaching problems linked to the creation and implementation of music arrangements. In conclusion, three teaching factors have identified in milieus of primary education: teacher autonomy, lesson structure, and musical structure of the arrangement."

Teaching practices in child-youth orchestras establish no difference with other educational settings because teacher beliefs are based on teaching styles applied mainly in conservatoires and professional schools of music. The objective of the present study is focused on exploring teacher beliefs that influence on inclusive practices, analysing to a group of instrumental instructors who participate in an orchestral project implemented within a public school. The method entails a nonexperimental qualitative design, given that the selected case is only analysed through observations and interviews. Results display teacher beliefs are focused on providing a secure milieu, where students feel free for giving opinions and practising the singing in order to internalise instrumental melodies. In conclusion, instructors provide sociomusical spaces for reflecting on and discussing issues linked to musical performances and repertoires, given that students have the autonomy for expressing opinions and emotions in a secure milieu."

In this study, we will establish the behavior that six teams of secondary education students display when carrying out creative activities linked to the soundscape, in the framework of the music subject in Chile’s education system. This quasi-experimental study is posed from the hermeneutic pedagogy as it considers the interaction between musicology and didactical intervention for interpreting student behavior in conformity with SDT. The qualitative data analysis entails the triangulation of a variety of tools, such as focal interviews and direct observation techniques. According to the results, most of the participants do not show self-determined behaviors during creative activities as they undergo both internal and external pressures within their teams. In conclusion, self-determination depends on the satisfaction of the three innate psychological needs."
1599,23,"TITLE: Controversies between curriculum theory and educational practice in music education Controversias entre la teoría curricular y la práctica educativa en la educación musical | KEYWORDS: Curriculum evaluation; Educational quality; Music education; Public education; Teacher effectiveness; Validated programs | ABSTRACT: The quality of an education system could be observed through the consistency between curriculum theory and educational practice. Particularly, Chile's curriculum expresses that creativity assumes a vital role in music education, both in primary and secondary education levels. In this study, the creativity is positioned as a predictor variable in the model, confirming the curriculum theory statistically. However, findings demonstrate that creative activities are scarcely carried out in educational practices, to the point that the higher the educational level, the less the creative activity. In conclusion, the consistency between curriculum theory and educational practice is under scrutiny. Therefore, future studies should not be focused on the confrontation between generalist and specialised teachers as such approach downplays the debate about pedagogical competences."

The research uses classic bibliography in health sciences and psychology, international standards on hearing thresholds, and validated researches addressing the development of tonal discrimination, localization of sounds in space, and the impact of hearing on integral child development. It is concluded that the hearing development in early childhood is not limited to physiological aspect, but it also involves other factors such as sensory, sensorimotor, perceptual and cognitive ones."

Here, we examined whether carnitinea palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), a key enzyme in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, affects energy balance. Methods: To obtain Cpt1aKO mice and their control littermates, Cpt1a(flox/flox) mice were crossed with tamoxifen-inducible AgRPCreERT2 mice. Food intake and body weight were analyzed weekly in both males and females. At 12 weeks of age, metabolic flexibility was determined by ghrelin-induced food intake and fasting–refeeding satiety tests. Energy expenditure was analyzed by calorimetric system and thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue. To study fluid balance the analysis of urine and water intake volumes; osmolality of urine and plasma; as well as serum levels of angiotensin and components of RAAS (renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system) were measured. At the central level, changes in AgRP neurons were determined by: (1) analyzing specific AgRP gene expression in RiboTag–Cpt1aKO mice obtained by crossing Cpt1aKO mice with RiboTag mice; (2) measuring presynaptic terminal formation in the AgRP neurons with the injection of the AAV1-EF1a-DIO-synaptophysin-GFP in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus; (3) analyzing AgRP neuronal viability and spine formations by the injection AAV9-EF1a-DIO-mCherry in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus; (4) analyzing in situ the specific AgRP mitochondria in the ZsGreen-Cpt1aKO obtained by breeding ZsGreen mice with Cpt1aKO mice. Two-way ANOVA analyses were performed to determine the contributions of the effect of lack of CPT1A in AgRP neurons in the sex. Results: Changes in food intake were just seen in male Cpt1aKO mice while only female Cpt1aKO mice increased energy expenditure. The lack of Cpt1a in the AgRP neurons enhanced brown adipose tissue activity, mainly in females, and induced a substantial reduction in fat deposits and body weight. Strikingly, both male and female Cpt1aKO mice showed polydipsia and polyuria, with more reduced serum vasopressin levels in females and without osmolality alterations, indicating a direct involvement of Cpt1a in AgRP neurons in fluid balance. AgRP neurons from Cpt1aKO mice showed a sex-dependent gene expression pattern, reduced mitochondria and decreased presynaptic innervation to the paraventricular nucleus, without neuronal viability alterations. Conclusions: Our results highlight that fatty acid metabolism and CPT1A in AgRP neurons show marked sex differences and play a relevant role in the neuronal processes necessary for the maintenance of whole-body fluid and energy balance."

Its fair practice is reduced to limit efforts when the circumstances of the patient point to the lack of possibilities for recovering. The goal of this study is to inquire about this problem under the perceptions of medical and nursing professionals who work in critical patients units. An exploratory qualitative study was carried out applying based theory as tool for analysis, through the search of theoretical categories in data. Among the global results, the limits to therapeutic efforts are highlighted as a habitual practice which professionals must face. Technical concepts are found clear; nevertheless, the main ethical problems are originated in the processes of decision making, since there is lack of knowledge on the ethical implications and a scarce reflection about the topic. Both groups of study lacked professionals trained in bioethics, frequent fact in this field."

This issue contradicts the objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to promoting good health and well-being (SDG 3), reducing pollution (SDG 13), and eradicating poverty in all its forms (SDG 1). In this context, this study aims to examine the potential impact of changes in thermal regulations on EP and carbon emissions in a Chilean social housing complex. Unlike previous research that relies on aggregate statistical data at the national level, this study adopts a micro-scale approach, analyzing EP variables at the level of individual households. Semi-structured questionnaire surveys were conducted, and the Ten Percent Rule Index (TPRI) was used to measure EP, while energy use was assessed to estimate carbon emissions. The findings reveal that the social housing complex is experiencing EP, primarily due to factors such as unaffordability, low energy-efficient homes, lack of energy literacy, and the use of firewood as a primary energy source, resulting in a TPR of 14.5 %. However, retrofitting to meet the latest proposed thermal standards can significantly reduce EP, with up to 22 % of households moving away from EP, and lead to a substantial reduction of up to 55 % in total carbon emissions. The study highlights the effectiveness of using the TPRI to evaluate EP and provides insights to better understand how housing retrofitting programs in developing countries may promote sustainability and inclusivity while reducing EP."

From an institutional logics’ perspective, we conducted this case study using surveys, network analysis, and interviews. Our network analysis revealed that most members had frequent communication with others, showing high connectivity between and within subgroups. Probing the corpus of interview notes and using an iterative approach, we found that basic researchers and clinicians differentially recognized and referred to the logics of care and the logics of science. However, both groups were able to identify some forms of bridged logics. This article contributes to our understanding of the development of robust translational medicine and the use of institutional logics in action."

While newsbots have begun to draw attention in journalism studies, little consideration has been given to how audiences perceive and respond to newsbots. Through the lens of human–machine communication (HMC), this article presents a case study of a newsbot interacting with Twitter users who shared news articles from the New York Times (NYT). In particular, we analyzed the Twitter users’ perceptions and responses to the newsbot using qualitative analysis. We found that Twitter users perceived the newsbot in several degrees: from ignoring it, to addressing the content curated by the newsbot, to responding to newsbot itself. Moreover, we found that Twitter users offered a range of opinions, personal experiences, facts, counter-arguments, and affective displays when they addressed the content or the newsbot. We discuss how newsbots can be effective tools to enhance news engagement, the obstacles that they face when they interact in online environments, and reflect on the range of communicative roles that newsbots play with online audiences."

Based on theories of teams and human and social capital, we describe how scholars' traits and social networks influence their team formation processes. We conducted a field study in Argentina in which 43 scholars used an online platform and assembled into eight interdisciplinary teams. Our results show that scholars initially tended to invite prior contacts, but, eventually, they assembled cohesive interdisciplinary teams with members they did not know before. We conclude by reflecting on how team formation platforms can enable individuals to expand their social capital."
1607,9,"TITLE: Explaining the Impact of South-South Migration: Evidence from Chile’s Immigration Boom | KEYWORDS: Chile; Fiscal burden; Latin America; Migration; Skill level; Xenophobia | ABSTRACT: Studies have extensively documented the effect of immigration on anti-immigration attitudes in high-income democracies. However, comparative political research has devoted less attention to South-South migration. We examine the impact of immigration on attitudes toward immigrants in Chile, which has experienced a threefold increase in its foreign-born population in the last decade. Using an instrumental variable design, we find that exposure to immigration increases hostile attitudes toward immigrants. Regarding the underlying factors driving hostile attitudes toward foreign-born groups, we find robust evidence pointing to immigration creating a public service shortage, which could explain the observed hostility. Conversely, we do not report evidence backing cultural anxieties or labor market competition. Hence, the Chilean case points to anti-immigrant attitudes gaining ground in contexts where welfare state provisions are limited and often precarious."
1608,9,"TITLE: The formation of attitudes toward immigration in Colombia | KEYWORDS: Colombia; conjoint experiment; ethnicity; immigration; labor-market competition; proximity; Venezuela; xenophobia | ABSTRACT: What explains elevated hostility toward immigrants? We identify two concerns that affect support for immigration: labor market competition and social proximity between immigrants and natives. Relying on a conjoint experiment embedded in an original face-to-face survey, we explore these dynamics in one of the largest migratory flows of the last decade: the Venezuelan exodus to Colombia. We find that respondents primarily reject lower-skill migrants. While ethnic proximity does not mitigate xenophobic attitudes in our context, familial ties and personal contact do. These findings confirm the relevance of pocketbook considerations in guiding attitudes toward foreigners but challenge the common assumption of positive in-group bias among co-ethnics. Moreover, we affirm the relevance of individual and familial proximity as key contributing factors to attenuating xenophobia in response to immigration in the Global South."
1609,24,"TITLE: Politics Matter: How Political Experience Mitigates Learning Losses Caused by Natural Disasters | KEYWORDS: 2010 Chilean earthquake; natural disasters; political experience; student achievement | ABSTRACT: Growing evidence warns about the detrimental effects of the stress induced by natural disasters on learning outcomes. Yet less is known about how political leadership could mitigate the adverse exposure to these events. Exploiting a natural experiment—the massive 2010 earthquake in Chile—as an exogenous shock and using fine-grained student data, we find that school disruption has a short and long-term impact on students’ test scores. Moreover, our results indicate that learning losses were more pronounced in municipalities with a first-term mayor, in contrast to a nonsignificant effect in municipalities with a reelected one. We show that one of the pathways accounting for these effects is the ability of experienced bureaucrats to mobilize educational resources, highlighting the relevance of managerial capacities in times of crisis."
1610,7,"TITLE: Does voluntary voting enhance partisan bias? evidence from Chile | KEYWORDS: Elections; Electoral risk; Partisan bias; Voluntary voting; Voter turnout | ABSTRACT: Although partisan bias - when an authority transfers discretionary public resources to a politically aligned receiver - has been extensively studied, less is known about how this practice is affected by the voting regime - compulsory or voluntary voting. In this article, I study partisan bias in Chile, using administrative data of transfers from the central authority to local governments, highlighting two relevant scope conditions: the electoral cycle, and electoral uncertainty caused by the adoption of voluntary voting. I found strong evidence of partisan bias, especially in election years and in electorally riskier municipalities. This suggests that the uncertainty introduced by this electoral reform induced politicians to allocate a large share of resources to risky municipalities, because such resources would play a more significant role in the electoral outcome. Overall, these results imply that voluntary voting has a large impact on the way that resources are allocated across subnational units."
1611,7,"TITLE: Incumbency advantage and shocks in the electorate: The adoption of voluntary voting | KEYWORDS: electoral accountability; incumbency advantage; political selection; voluntary voting | ABSTRACT: Although the advantage that incumbents may have over challengers has been extensively studied, less is known about how incumbency advantage is affected by the adoption of voluntary voting. In this paper, I study incumbency advantage in Chile, a country that adopted voluntary voting in 2012. I find that incumbency advantage substantively decreases with voluntary voting. The primary mechanism explaining such reduction was the entry of high-quality challengers, who invested their campaign resources much more efficiently compared to office-holders. Overall, this paper contributes to the literature on electoral accountability by identifying how sensible is incumbency advantage to voluntary voting and the entry of high-quality challengers. Indeed, as incumbency advantage decreases when capable challengers compete for office, it suggests that scaring-off skilled candidates is one of the drivers of such advantage."
1612,7,"TITLE: Do voters affect policies? Within-coalition competition in the Chilean electoral system ¿Los votantes afectan las políticas públicas? Competencia intracoalición en el sistema electoral Chileno | KEYWORDS: Chile; Electoral systems; Legislative preferences; Regression discontinuity design | ABSTRACT: It has been argued that close elections lead to policy convergence, as legislators elected by a small margin are more likely to adopt moderate policy positions (Downs 1957). However, Lee, Moretti, and Butler (2004) find that electoral competition does not affect legislators’ policy preferences in the United States, questioning the median voter paradigm. To help to discern this paradox, we estimate the effect of close elections on legislators’ subsequent policy positions under different electoral rules. With Chile’s two-seat open-list proportional representation system, we exploit the dynamics of within-coalition competition to test both hypotheses. Using the margin of victory in 383 races in four different parliamentary elections and 3,741 roll-call votes for the 120-seat Chamber of Deputies from 1998 to 2014, we find that electoral competition did not lead to policy convergence under either the center-left Concertación coalition or the rightist Alianza coalition. We contend that policy convergence responds to electoral incentives but is also conditioned by the nature of the political regime (presidential or parliamentary) and government-opposition dynamics."

However, scant attention has been paid to the mistakes students make and difficulties they encounter in these tasks. This exploratory study analyzed eight 2nd-graders’ (7- to 8-year-olds) responses, both appropriate and inappropriate, for individual interviews in which they were presented a contextualized task involving the function f(x) = x +5. We analyzed students’ initial responses, the interviewer’s interventions in face of inappropriate answers, and students’ post-intervention responses. Specific types of pre- and post-intervention (appropriate and inappropriate) responses to generalization tasks in elementary mathematics were identified. All participants solved tasks involving algebraic notions involving functions. These 2nd-graders’ work was significant considering the expectations of current curriculum frameworks. The types of responses identified contribute to the scholarly understanding of young students’ functional thinking, being useful for research and teaching purposes."
1614,0,"TITLE: Strategies and representations used by early childhood education students in a functional thinking task: A case study | KEYWORDS: early algebra; early childhood education; functional thinking; representations | ABSTRACT: This article presents a study that addressed the functional relationships that two early childhood education students (five-six years old) evidenced, as well as the representations they used when solving a functional thinking task. The proposed task involved the function f(x)=2x, with six questions on particular cases and one on generalization. The data was collected through a semi-structured interview to each of the students and a qualitative analysis of their answers was carried out in each of the questions of the task. The results suggest that the two students are capable of approaching the proposed task through different strategies, such as additive and multiplicative correspondence relationship, and covariation. Also, it was found that they use systems of varied representations, being the verbal representation to express the generalization of the functional relationship one that stands out. It is concluded that early childhood education students may be able to tackle tasks that involve algebraic notions that focus on functional thinking."

Functional thinking is an approach intended to promote algebraic thinking in students. At present, various curricular programs include notions related to this thinking. However, this type of thinking has had little influence on prospective teachers, thus arising the need to investigate how they approach tasks to prepare them adequately for their teaching. Objective: To analyse the strategies that prospective Chilean primary education teachers use when they solve a task that implies the generalisation of a functional relationship. Design: We follow a qualitative methodology at an exploratory-descriptive level. Setting and participants: The sample included 18 prospective primary education teachers from a Chilean university. Data collection and analysis: We collected the data through a written test in a group of 18 prospective teachers who were in the first year of training and analysed the data. Results: We highlight the diversity of arithmetic and functional strategies used by prospective teachers. In addition, we highlight their trajectories to solve the task, finding that most of them begin using arithmetic strategies and end using functional strategies. Conclusions: This research will identify the strategies used by prospective primary education teachers and whose data could be useful for the creation of teacher education programs."

Particularly, we focus on the functional relationships and the strategies that students use when solving problems, which involve linear functions. We analyse part of the data collected in a design experiment with a group of 30 students and individual interviews to four of those students. We find that the most frequent functional relationship was the correspondence one. Some students also identified the covariation relationship. Moreover, there is evidence of the connection between both functional relationships and the operational and counting strategies."

A specific type of noticing was used to describe the decisions of 21 FT when observing the strategies employed by 3 children to solve the equation 6+4= +5. The FT participated in a six-session course on the teaching and learning of algebra, based on video analysis as a means to approach teaching practice. Focusing on sessions 1 and 2, the written responses of the FT to two distinct questions were examined. The main results show that, although the FT's decisions frequently lacked evidential support, their reasoning aligned with specific aspects of algebraic thinking and research covered during the course. Finally, two positions adopted by the FT in decision making were identified: a) arithmetic, centred on the calculations that children should follow, and (b) relational, focused on the interplay of operations through the equals sign. The role of noticing and video analysis as tools to bring future primary school teachers closer to the practice of teaching algebra in primary education was discussed."

We designed a classroom teaching experiment implemented during the COVID pandemic in Chile. We analyze the oral discussions and the written productions of children in fourth grade (9-10 years old). The results show that the children expressed and justified increasingly sophisticated algebraic ideas. That is, they gradually adopted a more precise and abstract mathematical language. We conclude that this modality of work, in which the algebraic character of arithmetic is highlighted through various instances of discussion, is a contribution for teachers, by guiding them in addressing current teaching challenges."

Drawing on case studies of two patients in the United Kingdom affected by ultimately fatal brain cancer and bowel cancer, we elaborate on the concept of ethnographic sensibility. We highlight the continual attunement of capacities that guide our participation in intersubjective encounters that are suffused by an “existential excess” and help make sense of rapid transformations in our relationships with those who are dying. We situate our approach to ethnographic sensibility within phenomenological notions of shared experience and social becoming to discuss some of the features and challenges of producing knowledge forms about the ends of life."

In cancer care, verbalizing emotional reactions is understood as a healthy way of dealing with troublesome emotions. Yet, a type of silence, here understood as “not getting upset in front of each other,” helps participants to preserve relationships. This idea contributes to our understanding of silence as a relational form of moral work that seeks to preserve the well-being of others."

It argues that their sense of belonging to their neighbourhood and broader society is disjunctive: they inhabit the nation-state without complying with expectations of proper citizenship. Similarly, they dwell in their neighbourhood without identifying with it. Instead, they turn to intimate relations with friends and lovers as spaces of belonging. Through these often failing relationships, they pursue emotional and socio-economic stability and seek to fulfil expectations of social becoming and mobility. These intimate and romantic practices can both be understood as an utopian, affective promise that allows for imagining possibilities of a good life and as a moral exercise in the realisation of an adjacent self and we argue that intimacy constitutes a key site in the quest for social belonging among subaltern youth in neoliberal Chile."

To shed light on the prevailing literature and pertinent challenges, we undertook a systematic review, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. This examination encompassed empirical studies sourced from Scopus and Web of Science, culminating in the inclusion of twenty-four studies. The findings underscore the imperative to augment prior research that provides empirical insights into social and scientific narratives surrounding gender stereotypes. This review illuminates gender disparities within the educational system and the reduced female engagement in STEM. Concurrently, it advocates for formulating public policies and early-stage interventions to highlight how STEM disciplines can bridge these gender imbalances at the primary and secondary school stages. From our vantage point, this systematic review will catalyse forthcoming empirical inquiries. Whether stemming from real-world practices or geared towards enriching a specific theoretical framework, such research, especially involving students from Latin American nations, is of the essence. Notably, our search did not uncover any studies addressing the themes broached in this investigation about these regions. It is thus pressing to accelerate efforts in these territories to acknowledge the cultural and societal hurdles impinging upon STEM education."

However, designing effective interdisciplinary practices can be challenging due to the paucity of frameworks to guide their development. This systematic review aimed to examine the state of research on interdisciplinary practices that addresses the teaching of biology in higher education. Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were searched following PRISMA guidelines. Data were analysed by content analysis, and categories of analysis were designed based on (1) characterising the research, (2) identifying the disciplines used in the design of interdisciplinary practices for biology teaching and (3) characterising the structure of interdisciplinary practices implemented in higher education for biology teaching. A total of 567 records were obtained, of which 34 were included in the present review. The content analysis revealed that interdisciplinary practices for biology teaching advocate the methodological closeness between basic science fields, where the largest number of disciplines described (n = 30) is found. In addition, the structure of these practices highlights the use of collaborative strategies, practice, shared instruction and technology, framed to the knowledge needs, skills and motivational aspects that guided their design and implementation."

Given the articulations identified in the literature, it is interesting to determine whether new networks with the MWS provide powerful strategies for analysing mathematical modelling task resolution. Objective: to characterise the modelling activity from the network composed by the Blomhøj modelling cycle and the MWS in engineering students. Design: This work is a case study with a qualitative approach, which analyses the resolution of a modelling task through the proposed network. Setting and participants: The experimentation was carried out in an integral calculus course for a computer civil engineering career at a Chilean university. Modelling practices are not usual in this second-year subject, although enhancing their use in professional education is necessary. Data collection and analysis: We collected the written records of the students, selecting one to perform the in-depth analysis due to its high representativeness and clarity, as evidenced in the documents. Three steps were followed to characterise the modelling activity in the written record: description, analysis, and interpretation. Results: The Blomhøj modelling cycle might present connections with the MWS at the formulation of the problem and not only at the systematisation, which is a novelty in this field of research. Conclusions: A novel approach with which to develop the network between the MWS and modelling emerges, emphasising the investigation of mathematical problems using the student’s reality in higher education."

Its construction is a sine qua non condition to create a reciprocal and horizontal relationship between school mathematics and mathematics of other domains of knowledge. The nature of the aforementioned compels to study the social construction of mathematical knowledge, which provides the mathematics in use that happens in school, work, and life, and in their transversalities among these. These two aspects define a category of mathematical modelling, which on the one hand, formulates a theoretical variety and, on the other, it will involve a program to permanently change and transform school mathematical knowledge."

The proposed model allows to contrast the different thinking styles (TSs) found with the ones preferred by students in different levels of formation independently. With this purpose in mind, by using a quantitative methodology, 88% of male students in the program completed the questionnaires to determine these preferences, enabling us to perform a correspondence analysis through Fisher’s exact test. The RCGP results show evident preference for the legislative, executive, hierarchical, and external styles of thinking and clear differences between the preferences of students and of the RCGP. Finally, we discuss about various ways to create new means to strengthen and upgrade both the program’s graduate profile and the RCGP with the purpose of benefitting the formation of Computer Engineers and the future of the RCGP model."

A Lesson Study Group researched and planned the lesson around a problem from the official mathematics textbook. Design/methodology/approach: From an interpretative perspective, we have analysed the arguments produced by students in a situation where they should give reasons to support or refute some claims based on data analysis. We looked at how some teaching support strategies promoted collective argumentation. Findings: The strategies outlined in the lesson plan enabled the teacher to foster collective argumentation, encouraging students to provide reasoning based on data analysis. The lesson plan served as a means of improving the context presented in the textbook, guiding the development of well-structured teaching, and promoting high-quality teaching practices. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations, and future lines of research by the LSG is the deepening of teachers' understanding of the support required for CA in their classrooms so that they can distinguish the components of an argument and their role in and interpretation of the effectiveness of the arguments. In addition, the lesson plan did not consider in depth aspects such as the argumentative processes of the students, nor did it implement specific actions to promote argumentation. Addressing these limitations would be interesting and is necessary, considering that teachers still do not understand the key role of argumentation in learning and that the mastery of CA strategies is still a challenge for initial teacher training and for professional development programs for teachers. Practical implications: For research purposes, evidence is presented of the types of teacher support in collective argumentation in a comparative task of two dot plots. For teaching purposes, these types of support can be pointed out within Lesson Study Groups and included in lesson plans, allowing discussions and base-data argumentation. Social implications: The research has social implications in civic development, educational inclusion, and adaptation to technological and pandemic changes, with a focus on inferential statistical reasoning and the crucial role of the teacher in facilitating collective argumentation in the online school classroom. Originality/value: The study enriches knowledge about the potential of Lesson Study and the possibilities of planned online lessons to develop professional learning on collective argumentation with data, as exemplary teaching practices that should be widely shared."

From a lear ning situation, consisting of deciding between two random games with dices, the relationship between proportional thinking and probabilistic thinking is studied, considering three states for proportional thinking and three types of probabilistic thinking. Under the focus of an instrumental case study, the decisions and arguments of Chilean high school students are analyzed. The results indicate that there are both beneficial and harmful relationships between proportional and probabilistic thinking, and that the difficulties in determining probabilities are not necessarily due to the absence of the use of proportions. A teaching that considers argumentation and learning of the sample space is recommended to channel the use of intuitive resources."

Although there are multiple arguments and even social representations about its causes and implications, they all point to the fact that it is a conjunctural, momentary problem and restricted to the market. of rents. This article starts from the hypothesis that it is actually a conjunctural manifestation of a housing and urban crisis of a structural nature that has lasted for years and extends to all circuits of access to housing. Thus, the objective of the article is to analyze both in aggregate and from space-time variations in the city of Medellín, structural and conjunctural components of the increase in new housing prices between 2004 and 2022. The temporal and spatial scope of general and particular structural movements of the prices of new housing in Medellín was identified for different social groups and in non-VIS and VIS housing segments, with notable implications for the middle and lower classes. This allows us to conclude that it is a structural urban and housing crisis tending to a growing socio-spatial elitization."

Thus, the objective of the article is to identify what kind of relationships exist between the space-time cycles of the armed conflict between 1985 and 2018 and the processes of demographic change in the regional networks of cities in the department of Antioquia, a very important area of the country. in terms of the structuring of the last cycle of the armed conflict. An exploratory exercise is proposed that combines description, cluster analysis and elaboration of a bivariate synthesis of the relationships between victimization and dynamics of demographic change in regional networks of cities that reveal the existence of three main regional types of articulation. It is concluded that these correspond to different forms of expansion of the frontier of capitalist modernization, creation of centers and peripheries, links between legality and criminal illegality, as well as geopolitical dynamics of valorization and devaluation"

Geografías regionales y metropolitanas de la financiarización habitacional en chile (1982-2015): ¿entre el sueño de la vivienda y la pesadilla de la deuda? | KEYWORDS: Financialization; Housing; Housing policy | ABSTRACT: Through the process of financialization, neoliberal policies have turned social rights into debt. The Chilean case stands out in Latin American in that sense and it is argued that the early interpenetration of high finance–with the provision of housing–constitutes its true originality in addition to the already recognized subsidy to demand. Consequently, the objective of this article is to conduct a socio-spatial analysis of the regional and metropolitan geographies of mortgage debt between 1982 and 2015. For this, a dialectical logic is assumed, that emphasizes the description both in the creation and the adjustments that they have experienced, the mechanisms of financialization of the production of space and housing, as well as the process of massification of increased indebtedness in the period between 2004 and 2015. Finally, it is concluded that this massification corresponds to different subjects of debt and that the process of over-indebtedness raises questions about the possibility of future crises."

However, its geopolitical dimension has not been addressed in Latin American urban research. Therefore, the objective of the article is to compare the socio-spatial contents of housing policies based on a geopolitical differentiation between neo-liberal and neo-developmental states. Based on a chronological database of housing policies in the region, an analysis of criticism of the ideology that seeks to identify convergent and divergent points of Latin American housing policies between 2005 and 2015 based on seven critical axes was developed. It is concluded that, despite the diversity between the two geopolitical blocks and the internal differences within them, the national or international financial-real estate sectors have been favored with a consequent reduction of habitat."

Based on a critical analysis of the Housing Policy for Quality Improvement and Social Integration promoted in Chile in 2006—the basis for a set of subsequent policies—this study seeks to identify the link between state discourse promoting further urban centralization of social housing and neoliberal subsidy allocation practices that have shaped the geography of recent residential production (2007–2012). Using an ideological critique and a descriptive spatial analysis to assess the notions of urban centrality, we found that equality and integration form the rhetoric used to legitimize and reproduce practices that lead to peripheralization of the poor. These practices are not limited to the city but have expanded to the extended urban area, creating a larger niche for the real estate industry."
1646,0,"TITLE: Meaningful social interactions as a foundation for affection and learning for autistic individuals | KEYWORDS: Affectivity; Autism; Learning; Social interactions; Socioemotional development | ABSTRACT: Social interactions are postulated as a crucial part of socioemotional development and significant outcomes in life (Bauminger et al., 2003; Healy et al., 2013). There are different types of social interactions that we experience during our life, like caregiver-child, peer, and teacher-student interactions. Historically, social interactions have been promoted from an ableist perspective in autistic populations (Nario-Redmond, 2020). These modes of interactions expect individuals to conform to neurotypical social exchanges creating a great source of negative experiences for autistic individuals, which translates into stigma and mental health issues due to the impact on affectivity capabilities. Social interactions and their impact on socioemotional development have been stated as an essential mainstay for learning. Learning occurs when meaningful interactions develop, which, in turn, happen in specific shared activities and employ multiple resources. In this chapter, we provide a detailed description of how social interaction, affectivity, and learning interplay in the development of the autistic population. We discuss how the classical development and support models lack the understanding of the relevance of meaningful affection-based interactions to promote learning. We propose, as an alternative, the use of socio-ecological models (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998; Vidal et al., 2018; Vidal et al., 2022) to support a positive learning experience paradigm, promoting the development of social interactions in autistic populations."

This paper is concerned with the social organisation of knowledge around agri-environmental projects offered to farmers in the department of Caquetá in Colombia. Using Institutional Ethnography (IE), we start with the experiences and work practices of small farmers or campesinos to explore how these are coordinated with the work of other people also involved in the organisation of agri-environmental projects. We identified the ideological code of the ‘good producer’ and argue agri-environmental projects are part of the wider ‘project economy’; an institution that shapes campesinos’ practices. Our data shows that what is portrayed as solutions to achieve sustainable livestock, poverty reduction, and the halting of deforestation, end up eroding the trust and willingness to cooperate of those whose work is crucial to achieve the conservation goals these projects claim to promote. Our research contributes to the growing body of social studies about agrienvironmental systems and explains how such interventions reinforce neoliberal agendas that risk replicating modernising logics of productivity, accountability, and efficiency."

It also examines the strengths and challenges of “returning” researchers recognising their unique position in overcoming these binaries. Design/methodology/approach: IE is the method the researcher used to explore community-based water management in rural Chile. The researcher is interested in learning from rural drinking water organisations to understand the way in which their knowledge is organised. The data presented derived from field notes of participant observation and the researcher’s diary. Findings: The notion of “at-home ethnography” fell short when reflecting on the researcher’s positions and experiences in the field. This is especially true when researchers return to their countries to carry out fieldwork. The negotiation of boundaries, codes and feelings requires the researcher to appreciate the complex relationships surrounding ethnographic work, in order to explore how community-based water management is done in the local setting, without forgetting where the setting is embedded. Originality/value: Unique insights are offered into the advantages and tensions of conducting fieldwork “at home” when the researcher has lived “abroad” for an extended time. A critique and contribution to “at-home ethnography” is offered from an IE perspective."

Most of these initiatives were promoted by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.

In these negotiations, which became known as the ""fresh approach"", Bolivia proposed that Chile cede either a corridor north of Arica or an enclave (on the Chilean coast). In exchange, Bolivia would offer non-territorial compensations, i.e., principally the use of the waters of the altiplano or Andean Plateau. In this paper we seek to identify the reasons for the failure of these negotiations, being the last in which Chile agreed to discuss a territorial transfer, in which we argue that public opinion played a key role."

These efforts often involve a dual approach: promoting higher activity density to increase proximity to destinations while enhancing the experience of active mobility. However, a notable gap exists in addressing densely populated areas with established built environments, where the focus remains primarily on improving active mobility infrastructure. This study represents a crucial initial step in tackling this challenge. It examines mode distribution trends and trip purposes in Barcelona, an urban area that has recently seen significant enhancements in active mobility spaces. Our study sheds light on evolving modal share trends by analyzing local travel surveys from 2010 to 2019. The findings reveal relatively unchanged patterns in travel behavior at the city level during the examined years. Nevertheless, a closer examination of mode distribution for specific trip purposes, age ranges, and gender exposes noticeable shifts. The newly implemented infrastructure may have helped prevent a shift from active mobility to car usage, particularly for trips traditionally associated with public transit or walking, such as accessing public or health services. Further research is needed to explore this hypothesis and determine the extent of its impact."
1655,3,"TITLE: Heterogeneity in mode choice behavior: A spatial latent class approach based on accessibility measures | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: We propose a method to estimate mode choice models, where preference parameters are sensitive to the spatial context of the trip origin, challenging traditional assumptions of spatial homogeneity in the relationship between travel modes and the built environment. The framework, called Spatial Latent Classes (SLC), is based on the integrated choice and latent class approach, although instead of defining classes for the decision maker, it estimates the probability of a location belonging to a class, as a function of spatial attributes. For each Spatial Latent Class, a different mode choice model is specified, and the resulting behavioral model for each location is a weighted average of all class-specific models, which is estimated to maximize the likelihood of reproducing observed travel behavior. We test our models with data from Portland, Oregon, specifying spatial class membership models as a function of local and regional accessibility measures. Results show the SLC increases model fit when compared with traditional methods and, more importantly, allows segmenting urban space into meaningful zones, where predominant travel behavior patterns can be easily identified. We believe this is a very intuitive way to spatially analyze travel behavior trends, allowing policymakers to identify target areas of the city and the accessibility levels required to attain desired modal splits."
1656,21,"TITLE: The ‘Withdrawn Citizen’: Making Sense of the Failed Constitutional Process in Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; citizenship; constitution-making; neoliberalism; referendums | ABSTRACT: Chile's recent constitutional process (2019–2023) is a case in point of a democratic, bottom-up collective effort of constitution-making. It was also an opportunity to bring to closure Chile's long transition to democracy, in which the Constitution – written during the military dictatorship of General Pinochet – had remained in place. As a response to large-scale social unrest, the process was set in motion after a referendum in favour of constitutional change. However, the draft of the new constitution ended up being rejected by more than 60 percent of Chileans. While this puzzle has hitherto been explained by factors relating to the constitution-making process itself, this article emphasises a different variable: Chilean voters. By process-tracing different pieces of quantitative evidence, the article provides an answer that focuses on the characteristics of the ‘withdrawn citizen’, a type of citizen who is disengaged from formal and informal politics. This citizen did not vote in the first referendum and only voted in the second because compulsory voting was introduced. Our explanation sheds light on the structural factors that impacted the constitution-making process, relating to a type of citizen arguably produced by Chile's four decades of neoliberalism and by the very same Constitution that the process aimed to replace."

We combine three concepts emphasizing time-varying processes: deep-rooted societal inequality across class, ethnicity, and regions resulting in a fragmented civil society (long term); a mounting crisis in political representation (medium term); and the immediate trigger, namely, the removal of President Pedro Castillo (short term), which incited his supporters and sparked widespread protests."
1658,7,"TITLE: When do active citizens abstain from the polls? Civic associations, non-electoral participation, and voting in 21st-century democracies | KEYWORDS: Civic associations; Civic duty; Electoral political participation; Non-electoral political participation; Religious institutions; Voluntary organizations | ABSTRACT: One of the most consistent findings in the literature is that non-electoral political participation has a positive and robust association with electoral participation. However, all democracies have citizens who regularly engage in non-electoral political action but do not vote. Curiously, this abstentionist-activist profile has received little attention. Drawing on elements of the civic voluntarism model and electoral theories, this study tests an argument as to why and when active citizens—i.e., citizens who are politically active in non-electoral terms—are more likely to abstain from the polls. Using data from the International Social Survey Program and multivariate logistic regressions, the results show that when active citizens lack ties to social organizations, their probability of abstaining from the polls increases significantly. However, the results also showed that membership in organizations is relevant only for active citizens who express a limited sense of civic duty. This article discusses the electoral consequences of growing levels of activism based on forms of coordination that are not rooted in traditional civic associations."
1659,7,"TITLE: The Nexus between Protest and Electoral Participation: Explaining Chile's Exceptionalism | KEYWORDS: Chilean politics; labour movement; political participation; social-movement organisations; student movement | ABSTRACT: The literature on political participation has consistently found that protest positively and significantly correlates with voting. However, Chile can be considered a deviant case to this pattern. During the last decade, Chileans who participated in street demonstrations were unlikely to participate in elections. What explains this anomaly? We argue that this rupture between participation in protest and in elections results from an effective distancing between social-movement organisations (SMOs) and institutional politics. However, this distancing of SMOs from party politics has not been homogeneous. To examine this heterogeneity, we conduct a comparative design of two cases: the labour and student movements. Based on a mixed-methods study that combines interviews with movement leaders and surveys of protest participants in marches, we seek to highlight the mediating role of SMOs in the promotion of different forms of political participation."

This paradox suggests that scholarly assessments of democracy are, at least partially, at odds with citizens' own views of democracy. This article thus develops a framework to describe citizens' everyday experience with civil, political, and social entitlements associated with democracy. It introduces the framework by analyzing the structural underpinnings of democratic discontent in Chile and then applying it to the analysis of perceived citizenship entitlements in 18 countries, using the AmericasBarometer data. Significant variance is observed across time and both across and within countries. The descriptive findings also imply that only a (declining) minority of Latin American citizens feel fully entitled to civil, political, and social citizenship rights. We advocate the need to bring the demand side of democracy back to the analysis of democratic shortcomings and crises."
1661,-1,"TITLE: Politization in Labor Conflict: Analyzing the Demands of Post-Authoritarian Chilean Strikes | KEYWORDS: labor process; labor strikes; labor studies; politization; strike demands; unionism | ABSTRACT: By examining the demands of labor strikes in the private sector, this article claims that Chilean trade unions have experienced a politization process from the transition to democracy to our days (1990–2019). Assuming a Marxist perspective on the labor process, we propose operationalizing politization into three levels based on the nature of demands: (1) remunerative, (2) related to work conditions, and (3) related to the organization of the labor process. The study regards these three levels as a latent variable ranging from less to more control over the productive process, but, also, as a continuum ranging from more legal demands to more illegal demands according to Chilean labor regulation. The results show an increase of politized demands (i.e. more control and less legality) through the years. This case study sheds light on the consequences of a rigid and ineffective regulation and on the necessity to rethink politics in the workplace."

Understanding radical activist through regionalist mobilizations in Chile | KEYWORDS: political efficacy; protest; protest campaign; regionalist protest; violent tactics | ABSTRACT: Objective: This article seeks to better understand the differences between radical and moderate activists who come from the same mobilization process. Methods: Using an original survey data of participants in a regionalist movement in Chile, we employed latent class analysis on 15 different tactics. We found support for a radical, a moderate, and a non-activist profile. Next, we applied multinomial logistic regression models to explain differences both for recruitment (moderate and radical in reference to inactive class) and for participation (radical in reference to moderate class). Results: The participants who engaged in radical action were the youngest, the most embedded in activist networks, and those with the strongest perception of self-efficacy. Conclusions: These results contrast with previous evidence that associates participation in violent actions with a low perception of efficacy, isolated groups, and behavioral specialization. We argue that these differences derive from the context of our study, which can be equated to the initial phases of a protest cycle."

Entre la pretensión transformadora y la estrategia defensiva | KEYWORDS: Alliances; Labor reforms; Trade unionism; Union centrals; Union cleavages | ABSTRACT: This article states that, since the return to democracy in Chile, the Central Unitaria de Trabajadores (CUT) has played a double role for unionism. On the one hand, it has sought to promote, with very few resources and little success, new legislation for the private sector and, on the other, it has defended, with many resources and much success, the autonomy and interests of the public sector. How has this dual role played by the CUT since the return to democracy impacted on the identities and organizational practices of Chilean unions? To answer this question,it is proposed the concept of union cleavages, which describes a division that is simultaneously structural, ideological and organizational within Chilean unionism. Based on a historical analysis, it is described how the actions of the CUT were politicizing the structural division between the public and private sectors of unionism, consolidating collective identities around that division. By means of a quantitative analysis of the alliance networks in labor strikes from 2010 to 2019, the differentiated behavior of the main federations is described, according to whether they belong to the public or private sector. The results show that the public sector federations are the ones that find the highest density of alliances between them, generating a cleavage that is clearly differentiated from the private sector unionism, which is socially and politically isolated. The importance of considering this fracture within Chilean trade unionism is highlighted as a highly explanatory element of the limitations and strengths of CUT's political capacity."

After discussing the combined role of long-standing grievances, political attitudes, and cultural change in triggering the outburst, we study the interplay among peaceful and violent protests and criminal activity. We argue that brutal police repression and governmental mismanagement contributed to deepening the crisis once it exploded. We conclude by describing the attempts of the political class to cope with the crisis and speculate about its potential political consequences, especially for the Chilean party system."
1666,7,"TITLE: What makes a big demonstration? Exploring the impact of mobilization strategies on the size of demonstrations | KEYWORDS: Chile; Collective protest; demonstrations; mobilization; protest event analysis; social movements | ABSTRACT: Massive demonstrations are the staple of powerful social movements, but research on the factors affecting the size of demonstrations (in terms of number of attendants) is almost nonexistent. Why do some demonstrations pack long avenues with masses of people while other ones barely fill a street corner? Combining resource mobilization, political opportunity, and framing theories, we argue that mobilization strategies–the sequence of decisions and actions taken by protest organizers before staging a protest–shape demonstration size. Multivariate models with 937 Chilean demonstrations between 2000 and 2012 show that demonstrations are larger when they display more demands (especially universalistic demands), target the national government, attract more organizations (especially umbrella organizations), and mobilize cohesive groups with broad public support. We reinforce the internal validity of our argument using interviews with movement leaders and secondary research on Chilean society."

Based on interviews with leaders of 43 strikes held in 2014 and complemented by statistical data, three theses are proposed on what this labor conlict relects for the current state of trade unionism. 1) The alliances established in the strikes show that trade unionism in the private sector is isolated socially and politically, which contrasts with the syndicalism of the public sector, highly dependent on its alliances with Union confederations and political parties. 2) The overlow of the labor institutionality in the strikes of the private sector, is due to a greater capacity of union to mobilize workers. 3) It has been in the key export sectors of the economy that this internal and autonomous force of trade unionism has developed more rapidly."
1668,7,"TITLE: Shifting relationships between social movements and institutional politics | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter studies the changes in the relations between social movements and institutional politics in contemporary Chile. It is argued that the increase in collective protest during the last decade partially stems from an ongoing process of detachment of movements from political institutional actors. Disappointed by the absence of reforms that challenge the structures of Chile’s market society, activists have mobilized resources with little help from institutional actors and reacted to the perceived deficiencies of government policies. The chapter then goes on to compare the influential student movement and the less influential Mapuche movement. It is showed that movements are more likely to shape political outcomes if they can launch massive protest campaigns in visible locations with a predominance of disruptive yet peaceful tactics."

Exploring the determinants of protest tactics in Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Collective protest; Social movements; Tactics | ABSTRACT: Collective protest grew recently in Chile, yet we know little about the characteristics and determinants of the tactics employed. By examining more than 2 300 protest events between 2000 and 2012, we explore the determinants of the adoption of four types of tactics: conventional, cultural, disruptive and violent. Multivariate regression models show that: 1) protests against the State elicit conventional tactics, but protests against private companies elicit disruptive and violent tactics; 2) workers ""specialize"" in disruptive yet non-violent tactics; 3) the presence of formal organizations in the protest increases conventional tactics and decreases disruptive and violent tactics, and 4) protest events with a smaller number of participants are more likely to have disruptive and violent tactics than more massive events."

This article aims to understand the changes that these rural social-movements have experienced, with a special emphasis on the historical transit of the rural collective action in this new scenario. The proposed hypothesis is that the fight for the land, reshaped from a symbolic and valoric perspective, is still a primary factor in the demands that originate these social movements. The emergence of the new rural social movements is redefined as a dispute for the territory, in other words, the land with a meaning and history. The discussion will be centered on the rural-environmentalist movements in the framework of mining conflicts since these question themes related to territory and identity."
1671,14,"TITLE: Reducing GHG global emissions from copper refining and sea shipping of Chile's mining exports: A world win-win policy | KEYWORDS: Climate change; Copper mining; Global carbon emissions; Maritime transport; Reduction of fuel burning | ABSTRACT: Chile is the largest copper producing country of the world; and almost 50% of the copper it exports to the rest of the world is exported as copper concentrates to be smelted and refined abroad. However, 70% of the weight of these exported copper concentrates is gangue (valueless and undesirable material associated to the copper content in these exported concentrates). In this paper analyze and quantify the contribution Chile could make to the ongoing world efforts to reduce climate change and global warming, if it adopts a trading policy eliminating its exports of copper concentrates and replacing them with the greater value added exports of the refined copper obtained from smelting and refining those concentrates in Chile. This policy would allow a significant reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted every year to the global atmosphere. This reduction would occur through two channels: 1. avoiding the combustion of more than 600,000 tons of diesel oil currently used to transport by sea almost 6,600,000 tons of the gangue incorporated in Chile's copper concentrate exports; and, 2. using Chile's cleaner technology for smelting and refining copper concentrates instead of the dirtier technologies of the countries currently importing, smelting and refining the Chilean copper concentrates. For the first time, using data for 2014, we estimate the total net reduction in GHG emissions to the global atmosphere that the proposed trade policy would imply. We calculate the distance of the nautical routes used for the 919 shipments of concentrates exported by Chile that year; and we perform sensitivity analysis for 4 scenarios, employing two alternative values for two key parameters. Additionally, we compare the GHG emission performances of the copper smelting and refining metallurgic technologies employed in Chile and in every one of the 22 countries that import and smelt and refine Chilean concentrates. Our estimates for the 2 most extreme scenarios indicate that, if instead of exporting copper concentrates in 2014, Chile would had exported only refined copper, it would had contributed with a total net reduction of GHG emissions emitted to the global atmosphere of 2,227,047 and 2,799,279 ton CO2-eq tons that year, which are equivalent to approximately 5.6% of the total amount of GHG emissions that would had made Chile fully carbon neutral that year. This is a significant contribution regarding Chile's commitment to the Paris Agreement as well as in terms of the required world efforts to reducing GHG emissions from sea shipping."

In this paper, we want to provide a practical instrument for investigating airport transport service quality, based on the opinion expressed by a sample of passengers. The case study is the International Airport of Lamezia Terme, a peripheral airport placed in the south of Italy; the data were derived from Customer Satisfaction Surveys conducted during 2015–2016. We propose a modification of the well-known Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), by adopting as importance the weights determined through a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach, and by plotting the gap between importance and performance on a visual graph, that we hold as easier to be read and more intuitive than the one used in the traditional IPA. The results obtained by the proposed Gap Importance-Performance Analysis (Gap-IPA) suggest that the attention of the airport operator should focus on the service aspects related to cleanliness. Besides, the methodology can show which aspects should be kept under control for avoiding to become critical issues of the service."
1675,3,"TITLE: On the effect of operational service attributes on transit satisfaction | KEYWORDS: Heterogeneity; Multiannual surveys; Objective attributes; Public transport; SEM-MIMIC; Transit satisfaction | ABSTRACT: Public transport (PT) providers aim to offer services that meet users’ satisfaction, and for this, they can control some operational service attributes such as frequency, speed, crowdedness and reliability. Understanding how these objective attributes affect user satisfaction is essential to improve it cost-effectively, but these associations have not been examined enough in the PT literature. This study aims to unveil how key transit operational variables actually experienced by users affect their satisfaction. We analysed data derived from a multiannual consumer satisfaction survey for the Santiago de Chile Metro system; between January 2013 and June 2016 (n = 41,993), where approximately 1000 questionnaires were completed each month. We also gained access to a set of operational variables managed by Metro for the same period, including more than 1.4 million records. With this unique dataset, we first developed a structural equation model (SEM) with users’ perceived attributes, finding that safety, ease of boarding, response to critical incidents (CI), the number and type of CI endured, and information, were the variables that mostly affected satisfaction. We also examined heterogeneity in transit satisfaction with SEM-MIMIC models, by characterising the user population through their trip and socioeconomic characteristics, finding a striking result: that as users age they are more satisfied with the system. Next, we assessed whether including operational service attributes, such as crowding levels, frequency, commercial speed and CI, added predictive power to the proposed model. We found that the number of CI, speed, frequency and crowdedness, plus their variability (measured through the coefficient of variation), affected transit satisfaction at significant levels. Including these objective service attributes provided more explanatory power to the SEM-MIMIC transit satisfaction models. Policy recommendations for improving satisfaction, derived from our results, are: to implement an automatic control system for the number of passengers on Metro platforms (as safety and ease of boarding are critical issues for passengers); and to deploy a comprehensive tactical plan to address CI: determine which happen more often, take actions to minimise them and provide better responsive actions."

In this paper, we propose an analysis of the services provided by an Italian airport based on an SEM approach. Specifically, we propose a SEM-MIMIC ordinal Probit capturing the heterogeneity in perceptions of air transport passengers and identify groups of passengers with similar assessments of the services. Results suggest the presence of four constructs affecting the overall satisfaction at the terminal, namely information, control, environment, and food service. Results also suggest that there are two different user-types: accessory user (who uses ticket office, luggage trolleys, and escalator lifts), and technology user (who uses charging stations, airport website, and airport wi-fi)."
1677,3,"TITLE: Effect of critical incidents on public transport satisfaction and loyalty: an Ordinal Probit SEM-MIMIC approach | KEYWORDS: Critical incidents; Customer satisfaction surveys; Loyalty; MIMIC; Ordinal-Probit; Public transport; SEM; Service quality | ABSTRACT: Supplying public transport systems with high levels of service quality is fundamental for retaining users and attracting new ones. Policies that improve transit service quality will ultimately lead to more sustainable travel patterns. Measuring overall service quality implies measuring the quality of several specific attributes and is prevalently evaluated through the perceptions of users, using satisfaction rates. In this study, we demonstrate that there is a further element that can influence users’ perceptions, the so-called critical incidents (CI), defined as encounters that are particularly satisfying or dissatisfying. The concept is not restricted to ratings of the predefined product or service attributes, because customers who experience CI remember them well and can usually describe the experience. We implement a framework that includes CI and is innovative for several reasons. Firstly, we introduce attribute-specific (e.g. reliability, safety, comfort) CI to explain attribute-specific satisfaction levels, and then we model these with latent constructs allowing for measurement error in recalling the CI. We also demonstrate that using an Ordinal-Probit approach leads to more accurate results than its numerical counterpart, the latter possibly presenting biased results. Finally, we present a full Structural Equation Multiple Cause Multiple Indicator (SEM-MIMIC) model, which corrects for heterogeneity in the perceptions of users regarding satisfaction with the various service attributes, with the overall service, and with loyalty. For these purposes, we analyse an extensive database (96,763 interviewed passengers) derived from Customer Satisfaction Surveys in the railway services offered in the hinterland of Milan. Our main contribution to the literature is that we show that the occurrence of a CI has a substantial negative impact on passenger satisfaction for all service attributes. As it is a policy-related variable, it can be managed directly by the public transport (PT) administrators. To better plan and improve PT services, avoiding CI in specific items should be the strategy to follow. On the other hand, reliability, and added-value services are the primary service attributes that have a positive effect on satisfaction with the overall service and, in turn, on loyalty. Our model can be useful for PT administrators as it sheds light on how to improve the service according to users’ preferences, and by considering the differences among user categories."
1678,3,"TITLE: Latent factors on the assessment of service quality in an Italian peripheral airport | KEYWORDS: Airport services; latent factors; SEM; service quality | ABSTRACT: Compared to the other public transport systems, air transport has received limited attention on the assessment of service quality. This paper aims to explore the factors employed to assess airport service quality, taking as case study the International Airport of Lamezia Terme, a peripheral airport placed in the south of Italy. Specifically, through a Principal Component Analysis latent factors influencing service quality are identified and the dimensionality of the phenomenon is reduced. After that, a Structural Equation Modelling approach is performed in order to define the relationships among the latent variables, and between the observed variables and the latent ones. For these purposes, we analyse a database derived from Customer Satisfaction Surveys conducted during 2015-2016 in the Lamezia Terme airport. The results confirm that overall airport service quality is significantly related to latent factors such as accessibility to the services, control operations and environment in the terminal."
1679,3,"TITLE: Understanding public transport satisfaction: Using Maslow's hierarchy of (transit) needs | KEYWORDS: Loyalty; Maslow's hierarchy of needs; Public transport; Satisfaction; SEM latent class; SEM multi-group analysis | ABSTRACT: Public transport (PT) administrators require mechanisms to prioritise investments for improving their services, not only to maintain existing customers but also to attract new users. Customer satisfaction surveys allow detecting the level of global satisfaction with the PT system in addition to more specific satisfaction with its various attributes. Statistical analyses of these data allow determining which attributes impact more strongly on overall satisfaction. Although several econometric frameworks have been used for this task, we found only three studies loosely based on psychological theories to justify the models obtained. To address this critical gap in the literature, we postulate the existence of a Maslow's hierarchy of transit needs, with three types of attributes: functional (utilitarian), security (protection) and hedonic. To test our hypothesis, we estimate structural equation models (SEM), SEM-Multigroup, and SEMM (finite mixture) models, and assess their differences in four different cities with Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)-type systems in Latin America. Our results confirm the existence of a hierarchy in the different BRT-type system contexts, allowing to derive more generalisable conclusions. Finally, we provide direct policy recommendations by constructing a set of priorities for our case studies, concerning reliability, safety, customer services and comfort; which is generalisable to any PT system setting."
1680,3,"TITLE: The role of critical incidents and involvement in transit satisfaction and loyalty | KEYWORDS: Critical incident; Involvement; Loyalty; Public transport; SEM multigroup analysis; Service quality | ABSTRACT: We analyse the relationship between transit passengers’ satisfaction and loyalty. Understanding passengers’ behavioural intentions after experiencing a service is an essential task for transit managers. We use structural equation models (SEM) to explore the relationship among various satisfaction latent constructs. In particular, we introduce Loyalty, which represents the intent to recommend the service. We also introduce the concept of Critical Incidents (CI), i.e. closure of a transit line in the last three months (planned) or a service anomaly in the past month (unplanned), and hypothesise that CI negatively affects any attribute-specific satisfaction construct. We additionally model the concept of Involvement, measured as the intent to participate in future public transport (PT) marketing studies, and hypothesise that both Overall Satisfaction and Loyalty may affect this variable. Finally, we conduct an SEM Multi-Group Analysis (SEM-MGA), with the objective to determine whether heterogeneity is present in passengers’ satisfaction models, by incorporating users’ travel and demographic characteristics (i.e. gender, age, nationality, time of day, travel frequency, and trip purpose). Our findings show that CI significantly impact all attribute-specific satisfaction constructs, specially the unplanned events during the last month. We also find that Loyalty is influenced by Overall Satisfaction and also by specific satisfaction constructs. By comparing various SEM models, we find that service satisfaction constructs, such as speed and waiting time at the platform, are the most relevant towards Overall Satisfaction. The SEM-MGA serves as a tool to test for heterogeneity in the satisfaction models within user groups. We find differences in time of day, age, and travel frequency. Finally, we consider that the Involvement relationship needs further research. Our framework allows for more detailed policy-making in PT systems regarding heterogeneous subpopulations and more concrete policy variables, such as Critical Incidents."

This research aimed to evaluate the mediating role of Basic Psychological Needs in the relationship between practices performed by university professors perceived by students as motivating and learning-oriented motivation. The study involved 763 students from health and education programs at different Chilean universities. The PROCESS macro for SPSS was used to evaluate the mediating effect. The results indicate that the satisfaction of basic psychological needs partially mediates the effect of teaching practices on the type of learning-oriented motivation. This reinforces the idea of a situated, explicit, and frequent teaching practice with motivational formative actions that strengthen usefulness, importance, and autonomy. The findings show the relevance of these teaching practices to generating learning-oriented motivation and the role of the Satisfaction of Basic Psychological Needs in this relationship."

There is a positive and a statistically significant relationship between cold executive functions (cEFs) and self-regulated learning management (SRLM). This research is a quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, and inferential study, with a correlational approach. The sample was non-probabilistic, by convenience sampling, composed of n = 379 college students belonging to pedagogy careers, 64.1% were males, and 35.9% females, aged between 17 and 34 years old (M = 19.82, SD = 2.41). The results show that there is a strong association between cold executive functions and self-regulated learning management since high performance in cEFs would imply a high performance on learning management. On the other hand, it is also observed a predictive value of planning cEF on SRLM, meaning that, an optimal level of planning would imply adequate management of learning processes. The original contribution of this study is to provide evidence to consider supporting plans for college students to improve their skills in the cEFs, due to the negative impact that failure in higher education represents for the student, their families, and university system. Finally, we think it is necessary to continue the research in depth of these variables, and their influence in higher education academic performance."

The objectives of this research project were to analyze the activities lecturers implement in class to promote their students’ disposition towards studying; examine lecturers’ basic psychological needs satisfaction levels; and determine the relationship between feedback, beliefs, and affect for self-regulation and lecturers’ basic psychological needs satisfaction. A quantitative methodological approach, with a descriptive, correlational, and cross-sectional design was used, with a sample of 97 lecturers from Chilean universities. Data collection took place through a battery of instruments: the promotion of disposition towards studying survey; the feedback scale for self-regulation; the beliefs and affect in self-regulation survey; the satisfaction of basic psychological needs survey; and a sociodemographic questionnaire. The results showed that the promotion of disposition towards studying was a key factor to face social distancing and the loss of self-regulation for learning because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, a positive correlation was found between beliefs and affect in relation to self-regulation and satisfaction levels of basic psychological needs in the participating lecturers."

The results indicated that both the intrinsic regulation and the identified regulation partially intervene the effect of the perception of autonomy support on academic satisfaction, but only the intrinsic regulation totally intervenes the effect on the academic performance. It is concluded that the types of autonomous regulation are mechanisms through which it is positively influenced the well-being and academic achievement of university students."

The social position of the actors in the social structure or the influence they exert on the problem discussed is revealed. In addition, the underlying ideological discourse in the content issued by the media is identified. The main results account for the explicit criticism of the res process as insufficient, for the distancing of the institutions with regard to the social reality or for the intensification of the privatization processes. Likewise, we observe the reiteration of some structures that give a critical account of the underlying elements in the reform process, such as the criminalization of the student movement, the identification of the educational system as a consumer good and the strengthening of the private sector, among others."

The existing literature has proposed the concept of an integrated infrastructure management approach, yet this literature has focused on managing infrastructure systems in short-term contexts (e.g., response to natural and human-made disasters). As such, limited understanding exists about implementing an integrated infrastructure management approach in the long-term (i.e., maintenance and rehabilitation). This study aims to explore the challenges, drivers, and benefits of implementing an integrated urban infrastructure management approach by agencies managing urban water, wastewater, stormwater, and transportation infrastructure systems in the long-term. This study qualitatively analyzed 15 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the management of infrastructure systems in Chile. It was found that the implementation of an integrated infrastructure management approach is challenged and driven by organizational instead of technical aspects. It was found that the local context where agencies operate represents a challenge for the successful implementation, the willingness to collaborate of infrastructure agencies’ workers represents a driver to implementation, and that benefits encompass agencies and users. Infrastructure agencies can use our findings to account for contextual conditions to successfully implement an integrated infrastructure management approach."

The provision of infrastructure services to incoming displaced people may require changes to the existing infrastructure. As such, the provision of infrastructure services may elicit either support or opposition within hosting communities regarding the methods used to provide infrastructure services to displaced persons. This study assesses how hosting communities perceive various methods of providing water and wastewater infrastructure services to displaced persons; these methods are making (1) no changes, (2) temporary changes, or (3) permanent changes to the preexisting infrastructure. Statistical modeling and qualitative analysis were coupled to analyze data gathered from a survey deployed in 2016 to local German residents. The results suggest that the magnitude of displaced persons received by hosting communities, understood as a contextual factor, influenced hosting communities’ perceptions toward different categories of infrastructure alternatives. Qualitative analyses revealed that hosting communities do consider alternatives beyond physical changes, such as educating displaced people on using existing infrastructure. By understanding hosting communities’ perceptions of the provision of services to displaced people, decisionmakers and utility engineers may develop sustainable infrastructure alternatives with input from hosting communities."

Such a massive displacement of population creates challenges for host communities trying to provide them infrastructure services. For example, no front-end planning or construction may be possible given the unexpected nature of disaster events. This study assesses host communities’ public perceptions, at both city and national scales, of displaced persons’ impacts on water, wastewater, and transportation systems. This study draws on data gathered through a survey deployed in August 2016 to the public in Germany, where approximately 722,000 people sought refuge the same year. Statistical analyses show that heterogeneous drivers of public perceptions include both geographic and demographic parameters. Nonparametric tests reveal that the public perceived the impact on infrastructure systems similarly within city and national scales, but differently across. It is hypothesized here that the difference is due to residents perceiving this group of infrastructure systems as a system-of-systems that is part of their built environment. If we understand how hosting communities perceive the impacts of displaced persons, we may gain insights into perceived infrastructure disruptions. With such insights, we may assist policy-makers and engineers in planning locally acceptable infrastructure alternatives to integrate displaced population."

Both theories, first separately and then in relation to one another, are used to analyse two tasks proposed by the teacher in the classroom following a cross-methodology for networking of theories. Through a single case study research design, a content analysis of the transcript of the video recording of the lesson was conducted. The joint analysis of this lesson allows us to better understand the mathematical work taking place in the classroom. In particular, the results show the scope of each model and their complementarity through the detection of meeting points and blind spots, through the role of proof, representations, and the change between geometrical and numerical work in teaching Thales’s theorem. This allows for a deeper understanding of a teacher’s practice and teaching. Ultimately, relationships between the theoretical elements of both theories are established to show their complementarity. We conclude that networking between theories can contribute to the development of these theories by raising questions that involve examining their foundations and assumptions in greater depth."

The objective of this article is to characterize the mathematical work that a teacher proposes from the tasks and examples that he or she considers for the teaching of a geometric theorem. For this purpose, the suitable mathematical workspace of a secondary school teacher participating in a training workshop is analyzed. A case study is presented based on a unique case design, through video recordings and observations. The results reveal the privilege of algebraic treatments based on figurative representations, and a proposed change that involves the use of technological tools. Finally, contributions to the study of the teacher's mathematical work in the classroom focused on the use of tasks and examples are discussed."

We investigate the factors affecting the maintenance and decline of cognitive demand in the implementation of a statistics lesson by two teachers who participated in a Lesson Study group for third graders (8–9 years old). The results of the investigation show notable changes in the maintenance factors associated with the teachers’ questions and feedback, the scaffolding provided for the students’ reasoning and the modelling of high-level performance. In terms of the decline in the level of cognitive demand, the greatest changes were found in factors corresponding to the routinization of problematic aspects of the task and to problems in lesson management. Based on the results of our collaborative work with teachers in the context of Lesson Study, we conclude that it is possible to design and implement statistical tasks in primary school classrooms that maintain high cognitive demand."

The hypothesis suggests that the lack of nutritious food and poor hygiene, causing high mortality gradually declined due to the creation of pro-child state institutions. The study is based on mixed methodology, focusing on the qualitative aspects of written sources (such as laws, medical articles, memoirs, and the press) and the quantitative aspects of statistical records (such as statistical yearbooks). It concludes that the state’s child-centered ideology and practice spilled over into other social fields, attracting a range of actors who crystallized changes in child nutrition and demographics in the late 1960s."

The objective is to know the singularities of the fatal demographic phenomenon and the strategies that the local medical-political elite created to solve it. The tested hypothesis suggests that the incipient pediatrics in conjunction with the modernization of health works increased the quality of life of Penquistas children, gradually reducing the number of deaths. The historical sources on which hermeneutics was based were diverse: newspapers, scientific journals, municipal documentation and criminal files. The data provided by the sources made it possible to analyze the popular housing, medical demographics, food and child care, and the situation of health care centers. The conclusions emphasize that the provincial medical-political elite transformed the structural conditions and agents, allowing the indicators of infant mortality to improve in a slow process that only became noticeable towards the mid-1920s."

Its uniqueness lies in the long wait that these inhabitants suffered to resolve a crucial aspect in the conformation of their national identities, because according to the Treaty of Ancón of 1883 that ended the War of the Pacific, the election should have been held in 1894. For these reasons, this article analyzes the nationalist aggressiveness between Chileans and Peruvians during 1925-1926 in Tacna and Arica, emphasizing that practiced by the latter group, since historiography has not clearly highlighted the use of this Peruvian political resource. The objective is to contextualize the causes of said aggressiveness and analyze it from psychoanalysis. For this, government, criminal and journalistic sources were used to which a documentary and index analysis linked to psychoanalytic theory was carried out. It is concluded that aggressiveness was exercised in a similar way by Chileans and Peruvians, and that it was legitimized by social institutions that justified the violence during the elections. In this sense, it is essential to suggest as a research finding that during the phase studied it is possible to distinguish a «narcissism from small differences», a concept taken from psychoanalysis to make a reading about the specular rivalry between Chileans and Peruvians, which was founded on differential elements that overlooked the common features that united these peoples."

Three years later, in mutual agreement with Peru, Chile signed the Treaty of Ancón, in which it assumed conditional so-vereignty over these territories, even though this choice should have resided with the local peasants. Nevertheless in a short time, La Mo-neda coordinated, thanks to its agents, a socio-political project to «Chi-leanise» the local Peruvians. The administration of justice and land use, military service and the schools were three fields by which the Chilean state became instituted in southern Peru, a process that was not without difficulty."

The presence or absence of these problems may be due to personal or contextual factors and the possible protective role that they may exert. Objective: To examine the relationship between poly-victimization, resilience, and suicidality among adolescents in child and youth-serving systems. Method: Participants and setting: 227 adolescents, aged 12 to 17 years (M = 15.24; SD = 1.56), recruited from residential centers in Spain or the Spanish juvenile justice system, completed the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire, the Youth Self-Report, and the Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire for assessment of victimization, suicidality, and resilience respectively. Results: Poly-victimization during lifetime was reported by 61.7% and some kind of suicidality by 39.6% of the total sample. Logistic regression results showed that in the first step, suicidality was twice as likely in poly-victims as in the other respondents (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.12–3.90, p = .014). In the second step, the six resilience domains (self, family, peers, school, community and educators) were added. The self-domain emerged as statistically significant; it was associated with a lower probability of the occurrence of suicidality (OR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.14–0.70, p = .004) and explained significant added variance in suicidality over and above the measures of poly-victimization.

The mean age of participants was 15.24 years (SD = 1.56 (range 12 to 17). The Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (which includes conventional crime, caregiver victimization, victimization by peers and siblings, sexual victimization, witnessing and indirect victimization, and electronic victimization), and two items from the Youth Self-Report were used to assess victimization and suicidality respectively. Lifetime poly-victimization was reported by 61.7% of the overall sample, and suicidality by 39.6%. The logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds of presenting suicidality were twice as high in the poly-victims (OR = 2.13). Sexual victimization was a statistically significant predictor and was associated with the occurrence of suicidality (OR = 2.67). In view of the high prevalence of victimization and its association with suicidality in this sample, we propose that the assessment of victimization should be included in the design of policies for suicide prevention and intervention."

In several countries, public transport and delivery drivers were considered essential workers during the pandemic, while the demand changed dramatically. In this context, little is known about the actual effects of the pandemic on the lives of drivers, and whether those effects depend on the type and formality of the corresponding job. In this paper, we analyse the impact of the pandemic on the daily jobs of public transport, ride-hailing, and delivery app drivers: we study changes on working time and income, pandemic-related concerns, and deterioration of job satisfaction, through a survey applied to drivers during the first peak of the pandemic in Santiago, Chile. Probit regressions on job satisfaction identify the main COVID-related experiences that explain variations in subjective perceptions. We then discuss the implications for post-pandemic job relationships, drivers’ working conditions and urban mobility. We show that the unstable characteristics of app-based jobs sharpened during the pandemic: Public transport drivers have kept their jobs, with a similar income as in the pre-pandemic situation and keep their social security, whereas ride-hailing and delivery app drivers do not have social security. Several ride-hailing drivers lost their jobs without any compensation, while delivery drivers earn less money per hour, are more exhausted, and express the greatest concerns and largest decrease in their job satisfaction. The COVID-19 crisis has emphasized that the sustainability of post-pandemic passenger and delivery on-demand services needs to rely on formal job regulation and worker protection."

The study uses a quantitative method research design to examine, in the first place, salary trends and socio-demographic and occupational characteristics of the YLM; and second, to analyze the numerical flexibility in terms of contracts, working hours, and outsourcing. The results suggest that the wage process of young people has stopped in the private sector. Furthermore, young workers have higher levels of numerical flexibility, lower wages, and are inserted in unskilled service occupations, despite having higher credentials than adults. The latter could be explained by labour segmentation mechanisms and the role that the youth labour market plays in the neoliberal economic order."

1720,-1,"TITLE: So Far, so Similar? Labour Market Feminization in Italy and Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Comparative studies; Dissimilarity index; Gender segregation; Italy; Labour market segmentation | ABSTRACT: The article aims to analyse gender segregation in the labour market while comparing two national contexts in Europe and Latin America. Specifically, it will consider the growth trends of female employment in the last 25 years (1992–2017), its distribution between activity sectors and occupations, and the gender pay gap. Feminization models and gender inequalities are framed within labour market segmentation theories, which are in partial contrast to human capital theories and neoclassical economics. The initial hypothesis is that the gender distribution of occupations measured by a segregation index is similar in Italy and Chile, despite significant differences in the socio-economic and institutional contexts. Through this intercontinental comparison, the article intends to shed light on women’s labour market conditions and segregation patterns, which are multidimensional and generalizable (transcontinental) phenomena, connected to the unequal division of labour in the new post-industrial order."

First, it reviews the background of the formation and development of the working class until 1973. Second, it analyses the main transformations in the action and social structure of the workers and their organizations during dictatorship. It is argued that between 1973 and 1977, some of the trade unions tried to represent politically the workers before the dictatorship. Since 1978, trade unions tried to resist the neoliberal reforms and established the basis of an opposition to the military regime. Finally, it is concluded that the disarticulation of its social bases, particularly of the industrial working class, and the way in which the transition is politically solved, made it difficult for them to recover it's structure and power achieved until 1973."
1722,3,"TITLE: Identifying representative weeks: A clustering analysis of urban dynamics based on public transport data | KEYWORDS: Bus system operational characteristics; Clustering passive data; Representative week | ABSTRACT: Transportation is key to understanding urban dynamics, with public transport bus systems shaping mobility patterns, accessibility, and activity, especially in developing countries where this mode accounts for a significant share of trips. Passive data like GPS and smart card records can reveal these patterns when properly processed. This study proposes a clustering-based methodology to analyze public transport bus data collected over an arbitrarily long period (at least a week) to identify time blocks with similar dynamics without predefined structures. If the dynamics for each time block in a week is the same over time, a representative week can be constructed, showing the most likely dynamics for each time block in a week. The analysis considers three dimensions: demand (passenger counts), supply (distance traveled by buses), and level of service (bus speeds). Cluster results generate a representative week in terms of mobility indicators and transport operations, enabling analysis and comparison of dynamics across different city zones. Using data from Santiago de Chile's bus system for August 2019 and April 2020, the methodology was applied to 10 city zones. Results highlighted distinct dynamics across zones and the need to incorporate all three dimensions for representative weeks. Regular application of this approach is crucial, as cluster characteristics evolve over time. While promising venues for future development remain, our methodology provides a flexible, robust data-driven foundation for understanding urban transport dynamics, adaptable to different cities and supporting evidence-based decisions."
1723,3,"TITLE: The role of parental involvement and gender on travel mode decisions to School in Bali, Indonesia | KEYWORDS: Gender differences; Indonesia; Parental involvement; School travel modes | ABSTRACT: Adolescence is marked by exploratory, risk-taking behaviours and gender-specific challenges that often involve parental involvement in travel decisions. This study examines the interplay between parental influence, gender, and travel mode choice in shaping school travel behaviours by analysing data from 2402 adolescents aged 12–18 in Bali, Indonesia. Explanatory factor analysis (EFA) was used to identify underlying latent constructs related to travel attitudes, and a multinomial logit (MNL) model was estimated to analyse the probability of choosing different travel modes while accounting for parental involvement, gender, and other individual-level characteristics. The findings show that grade, gender, school location, mode availability, parents' employment status, family income, and parental involvement influence travel mode decisions. The majority (55.62 %) of adolescents make travel decisions jointly with parents, with parental influence being more substantial in junior high school. Despite perceiving motorcycles as less safe than other modes, senior high school students are more likely to use these private vehicles. In particular, Boys prefer motorcycles as they are persuasive in convincing parents to grant them access, especially in areas with little societal pressure against underage driving. In contrast, girls are more likely to be escorted, aligning with parental preferences to avoid unsafe motorcycle use. Moreover, when parents are the primary decision-makers, gender differences in travel choices diminish as safety concerns take precedence, discouraging private vehicle use. These findings underscore the need for enforcing legal driving age limits, particularly during the transition to senior high school. Addressing this issue requires harmonising transport and school policies, strengthening traffic law enforcement, providing safer travel alternatives, ensuring secure school routes, and increasing parental oversight."
1724,3,"TITLE: Determinants of travel mode access for adolescents in developing countries: a literature review | KEYWORDS: accessibility; adaptation strategies; Adolescent mobility; Global South; LMICs; modes of transport | ABSTRACT: Mobility and accessibility challenges faced by adolescents aged 12 to 18 are increasingly recognised. However, research from developing countries often overlooks this demographic group. This literature review advances research by identifying the determinants of accessibility to transportation modes and adaptive strategies for adolescents who lack travel options. Our synthesis highlights the significant roles at individual, family, community, and structural levels in accessing and utilising travel modes. It emphasises the important role of parents in determining adolescents’ access to travel modes, noting that a safe environment is a primary concern leading to parental supervision, often through private vehicles. Our review also reveals adaptive strategies among certain adolescents, such as girls walking in groups to socialise and avoid unsafe situations, older adolescents accessing travel modes that offer independence and affordability, and persuasive efforts by younger adolescents leading parents to permit unauthorised private vehicle use. To address these dynamic issues within developing countries, we outline strategies from the literature to ensure a safe environment involving multiple stakeholders while considering variations based on local contexts, such as ideologies related to specific modes. We also highlight the need for further research to better understand adolescent preferences in transportation access across different activities impacting subjective well-being."
1725,3,"TITLE: Unraveling the travel patterns of ride-hailing users: A latent class cluster analysis across income groups in Yogyakarta, Indonesia | KEYWORDS: Income; Indonesia; LCCA; Ride-hailing; Travel patterns | ABSTRACT: This study provides valuable insights into ride-hailing trip patterns among various income groups, including lower-income groups and those living below the poverty line, groups often overlooked in previous research. Using latent class cluster analysis (LCCA) based on a survey in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia, we examine how variations in trip pattern characteristics are influenced by socio-demographics, household characteristics, and travel-related attitudes toward ride-hailing usage. Our results establish that six distinct clusters representing different ride-hailing travel patterns can be identified. We found dominant clusters for short and less expensive trips using motorcycle-based ride-hailing services (RH MC). In contrast, longer and more expensive trips are associated with car-based ride-hailing (RH CAR). Moreover, ride-hailing plays an important role in essential trips such as returning home, commuting, and maintenance activities, highlighting its importance in addressing transportation challenges, particularly in regions with limited public transportation access. Lower-income individuals and those living in poverty tend to use ride-hailing primarily for shorter and cheaper trips with RH MC, while those from higher-income brackets utilize it for a broader range of purposes. These findings highlight the diverse effects of ride-hailing across income groups and suggest the potential for ride-hailing to enhance accessibility for low-income individuals in Indonesia. We propose policy recommendations to alleviate transport poverty and enhance transport equity in light of these findings."

It is thus not only relevant but also critical to better understand the determinants of car ownership and use. Among those contributing factors, the role of subjective factors is often acknowledged to be important, yet not well understood. We conduct a systematic review of the literature regarding the effect of such motives on car ownership and usage. Based on the commonalities found in the reviewed articles, we identify and describe the five most relevant subjective factors in detail: (i) instrumental motives and autonomy, (ii) affective motives, (iii) symbolic motives, (iv) social norms, and (v) environmental motives. We synthesise these findings in a car ownership/use motives model, discuss implications for public policy and outline directions for future research."
1727,5,"TITLE: The effect of COVID-19: to what extent does food delivery substitute eating out trips in Yogyakarta, Indonesia? | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; Eating out; Food delivery; ICT effects; Panel data; Ride-hailing | ABSTRACT: The study aims to assess the impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on travel and out-of-home activity by analyzing primary data collected from ride-hailing app users in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia. The data was analyzed using a random effect ordered logistic panel model. The results indicate a complementary relationship between food delivery and eating out. Individuals who frequently use food delivery services are more likely to also engage in eating out activities, and vice versa. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on these behaviors. Eating out experienced a substantial decrease during the pandemic, while food delivery remained stable. The findings highlight that food delivery cannot easily replace the experience of eating out, even under lockdown conditions. Overall, this study provides insights into the dynamics between food delivery and eating out, emphasizing the complexities and limitations of substituting one with the other."
1728,6,"TITLE: Aerial cable cars as a transit mode: a review of technological advances, service area characteristics, and societal impacts in Latin America and the Caribbean | KEYWORDS: Aerial-cable cars; global south; public transport; societal impacts; transport innovations | ABSTRACT: The success of the first Metrocable line in Medellín (2004) as a feeder for the Metro system served as a turning point in considering the use of aerial cable cars (ACC) as a mode of public transport in urban settlements. In the following years, 33 ACC transit lines were inaugurated in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the majority after 2010. This review has several aims: (i) to understand the differences in aerial cableway transit (ACT) technologies; (ii) to describe the characteristics of the ACC service area for the most critical case studies in LAC and identify their role in the public transport system; and (iii) to find the essential societal benefits presented by ACC. We will follow two complementary approaches. First, the review concentrates on the most recent technological advances. Second, 24 reports were obtained from scientific databases, complemented by another 18 found using the “snowball” method. Our findings show that detachable gondolas, called aerial cable cars in the transport literature, are the most used technology as a transit mode. Furthermore, the ACC initially served as a feeder mode, serving low-income communities on hillside terrains. However, some cases are restructuring the public transport system and building a comprehensive network utilising the ACC. The empirical evidence shows that complementary projects are essential to impact less-frequent ACC users and people in the neighbourhood. Moreover, travel time and cost reductions increase accessibility and reduce inequalities, especially in the service area. Participatory budgeting may also prompt community engagement with the project, especially among low-income residents. Considering integration between transport modes (and within transit modes) in the project's early stages will also increase ridership and users’ accessibility. Future research should focus on the travel behaviour and societal impacts of ACC integrated into the structure of the public transport systems."
1729,3,"TITLE: The shareability potential of ride-pooling under alternative spatial demand patterns | KEYWORDS: Ride-hailing; Ride-pooling; Shareability; Shared mobility; Travel demand | ABSTRACT: In In this study, we set out to explore how various spatial patterns of travel demand drive the effectiveness of ride-pooling services. To do so, we generate a broad range of synthetic, yet plausible demand patterns. We experiment with the number of attraction centres, the dispersion of destinations around these centres, and the trip length distribution. We apply a strategic ride-pooling algorithm across the generated demand patterns to identify shareability potential using a series of metrics related to ridepooling. Our findings indicate that, under a fixed demand level, vehicle-hour reduction due to ride-pooling can range between 18 and 59%. These results depend on the concentration of travel destinations around the centre and the trip length distribution. Ride-pooling becomes more efficient when trips are longer and destinations are more concentrated. A shift from a monocentric to a polycentric demand pattern is found to have a limited impact on the prospects of ride-pooling."
1730,3,"TITLE: A discrete-event public transportation simulation model to evaluate travel demand management impacts on waiting times and crowding conditions | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; Discrete-event simulation; GTFS; Public transport; Smart card data; Travel demand management | ABSTRACT: Several approaches have been proposed and adopted by researchers and decision-makers to improve and deal with public transport operation issues, especially travel demand management (TDM) measures. Disruptions like lockdowns provoked by weather conditions, political riots, special events, natural disaster issues, or the recent COVID-19 pandemic create a need for tools to manage public transport demand and supply o keep users circulating in an efficient, convenient and safe manner. Our work develops a simulation tool of the operations of a public transport system using smart card, GTFS and census data to evaluate the impacts of different intervention scenarios using the pandemic context as a case study. Using a pre-pandemic baseline scenario, we study the impact of several travel demand and public transport supply measures, focusing the analysis on waiting times and crowding conditions inside vehicles and platforms. As a result, we generate easy-to-analyze visual outputs that facilitate prioritizing actions at the metropolitan and district level, identifying where and when waiting times and crowding conditions would exceed certain thresholds."

Using longitudinal data from before and during the pandemic, we find that the number of respondents in our study who shop online at least once per week increased nearly five-fold between fall 2019 (11.6%) and spring 2020 (51.2%). We estimate a series of ordered logit models to establish who is responsible for this recent rise in e-commerce, and to help assess whether it will be temporary or longer lasting. We then discuss the equity implications and urban and regional restructuring that this change in e-shopping behavior may entail."
1732,5,"TITLE: Comparing COVID-19 in the antipodes: Insights from pandemic containment strategies on both sides of the Pacific | KEYWORDS: COVID-19 responses; Latin America, Southeast Asia | ABSTRACT: That the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in terms of its scale, spread and shocks can be evinced by the myriad of ever-changing responses cities all around the world have rolled out throughout the different waves of outbreaks. Although the threat is similar across the world, it took some time before its reach became global and the waves of outbreak are experienced by cities at different times. While this staggered spread imply that some cities might manage the virus better as they learn from the experiences of cities which had been amongst the earliest to face the virus, the reality is more complicated. In the early stages of the pandemic, the global consensus on the best way to contain the virus swiftly converged in the interlinked strategies of restricting the movement of people and minimizing their social contact. However, the effectiveness of these strategies differ greatly between cities. To that end, this study focuses on COVID-19 responses in two regions (Latin America and Southeast Asia) and examines the evolution of the first wave of COVID-19 outbreaks during 2020 in Singapore, Jakarta (Indonesia), Bogotá (Colombia) and Santiago (Chile). The study is based on a comparative approach and uses a variety of data sources, namely morphology, density, housing concentration, mobility, and governance in the four analyzed cities. The goal is to shed light on the response of city governments in these two different regions in terms of mobility restrictions in order to reduce the cases of new infections. The results show the relevance of urban policies and their territorial approaches, particularly in terms of mobility and public transport networks in the four cities."
1733,3,"TITLE: Public transport reliability across preferences, modes, and space | KEYWORDS: Aggregate demand; Public transport; Transport planning; Travel time reliability; Traveller's experience | ABSTRACT: Reliability is understood in public transport as the certainty travellers have regarding the level of service they will experience when travelling. The travel time, waiting time, or the comfort level they will experience inside the vehicle are some of the most important reliability attributes. Reliability is usually neglected from travel behavioural models, since there is a lack of studies addressing its impact in travellers’ choices. This study proposes an in-depth analysis and characterization of travel time reliability in a public transport system using passive data only, which every day is getting more popular worldwide. The study is comprised of two parts, taking Transantiago (the public transport system of Santiago, Chile) as a study case, as it is a good representation of a frequency-based public transport system. In the first part a statistical and graphical analysis of travel times is conducted, focusing on characterizing headway and travel time reliability of public transport services as well as the effect of dedicated infrastructure, based on smartcard transactions and GPS information. In the second part an aggregate mode choice model based on revealed data is developed to analyse the effect of travel time reliability on travellers’ preferences. Overall, this study provides evidence of significant differences among headway variability and in-vehicle travel time dispersion different public transport modes. The standard deviation (a measure of dispersion) can be quite high for bus trips, while in the case of metro is smaller than 4 min independent of trip length. Regarding the aggregate public transport mode choice model, the coefficient of variation of headways is a key attribute to explain modal preferences. It was found that average bus users would accept traveling ~ 5 min longer to completely avoid headway irregularity. All these results were obtained by analysing passive-data from AFC and AVL systems only, which represents a novel approach for choice modelling. Transport modellers should consider the impact of service reliability to improve route choice and passenger assignment models, and better represent users’ perceptions and behaviour."

In this chapter, we discuss how participation in activities and travel behavior choices have changed during the various stages of the pandemic through the analysis of data collected through multiple waves of surveys administered in 2020 in various regions of the United States. We present insights regarding how different aspects of life and mobility have reshaped during this period and discuss the potential temporary versus longer-term nature of the changes. We observe how some phenomena that presented a steep increase during the first stage of the pandemic started to decline, to some extent, in late 2020, whereas others, such as the adoption of remote work and increased reliance on personal vehicles, persisted also in the later stage of the pandemic at rates that are considerably higher than the prepandemic patterns. We discuss the different impacts that the pandemic has had on different segments of the population, and the importance for public policies to react to these new circumstances not only to account for the modified mobility and travel behavior landscape but also considering the socioeconomic and equity implications underneath these impacts."
1735,3,"TITLE: Headway variability in public transport: a review of metrics, determinants, effects for quality of service and control strategies | KEYWORDS: bus bunching; comfort; control; quality of service; Reliability; service planning | ABSTRACT: The most relevant issues related to headway variability in public transport planning, operations and quality of service are reviewed in this paper. We discuss the causes and consequences of headway variability, the alternative metrics that have been proposed to measure it, the preventive and reactive strategies to control headway variability in both research and practice, including the role of drivers and of present and future technology, and how service provision contracts might deal with headway variability through metrics and financial incentives. The most influential elements that explain headway variability along a route are the irregularity at which vehicles are dispatched, the scheduled frequency, the distance travelled or route length, the passenger demand and associated dwell times, and the number of stops. We conclude that there is a large gap between the state-of-the-art and the state-of-practice in terms of identification of headway variability issues, as well as in the development of mitigation and control measures. It is therefore paramount that future research will contribute to closing this gap by addressing organisational, contractual and technological barriers in the implementation of measures aimed at mitigating headway variability in public transport services."
1736,3,"TITLE: A comprehensive perspective of unreliable public transport services’ costs | KEYWORDS: headway control management; headway regularity; Public transport; service reliability | ABSTRACT: In recent decades, the main focus of public transport operations has been increasing its speed. Increasing speed not only allows for faster trips but also a higher frequency with the same fleet size, thus reducing waiting times and crowdedness inside the vehicles. This interest in speed has ignored a second key dimension in the level of service: reliability. In this article, we provide a review of a full range of impacts of an unreliable public transport service. We show how regularizing headway could improve level of service beyond the gains of simply increasing the operational speed. Regular headways positively affect comfort, reliability, travel and wait time, operational costs, and even some urban impacts of bus services. Thus, the focus for public transport agencies and operators should bend into reliability’s direction. This is fundamental for making public transport an attractive travel alternative, and therefore must become a core goal for urban sustainability."

Objective: To examine the differences in motivation, barriers and benefits between the practice of physical exercise via mHealth and in person. Method: Pre-experimental study in 37 adults (96.5% women, 43 ±10.5 years old) from the Biobío, Chile, who participated in a physical exercise intervention via mHealth. The Exercise Behavior Regulation Questionnaire (BREQ-3), and the Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale (EBBS). Results: After the intervention, the mHealth physical exercise group presented a higher external regulation type motivation score (3.25 ±3.79 v/s 1.08 ±1.60; t(33.676)= 2.434, p= 0.020, d= 0.676), a lower integrated motivation score (3.25 ±3.79 v/s 1.08 ±1.60; t(33.676)= 2.434, p= 0.020, d= 0.676), and a lower index of self-determination in the practice of physical exercise (45.25 ±26.54 v/s 67.38 ±19.61; t(35)= -2.635, p= 0.012, d= 0.908) than the group face-to-face physical exercise. No significant differences were observed in the barriers and benefits for the practice of physical exercise. Conclusions: The exercise via mHealth generated greater external motivation and less integrated motivation compared to the face-to-face exercise. These findings support the potential of mHealth technology to promote physical activity motivation and overcome perceived barriers."

In Chile, punitive control policies such as the Safe Class Law (Ley Aula Segura) have been adopted. A key actor in the public debate is the Chilean Teachers’ Union, due to its potential impact on new public policies on the issue. Objectives: The aim of this study was to reconstruct the subjective theories of school violence and school climate presented by the Chilean Teachers’ Union after the COVID-19 pandemic, in its public discourse broadcast on the web news. Methods: Based on a documentary study, a case study design and qualitative methodology, embedded in the FONDECYT project No. 1231667, titled “The social construction in Chile of school climate and school violence after the return to face-to-face education,” web news (N = 36) were analyzed in which the Chilean Teachers’ Union explains school violence and school climate after the pandemic. Results: We found subjective theories that explain the meaning of school violence and school climate, and external factors associated with the serious deterioration of these educational dimensions after the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we obtained a set of measures such as inclusive policies, curriculum, participation in the development of educational policies, and refunding public education that teachers propose to solve these phenomena in the future. Discussion: In the context of a union that has historically considered public policies to be non-participative in their formulation and distant from the schools’ reality, these findings have important implications for understanding the arguments of the Teachers’ Union about the need to improve mental health and working conditions as crucial elements for addressing school climate and school violence."

For this, a qualitative-descriptive approach was used to analyze the data on the impact of the program. As an instrument of analysis, the notion and method of personal agency was chosen, which gives priority to freedom, the fulfillment of goals and the development of transcendent personal values for the individual. Among the main results obtained, the achievements made by older people in self-efficacy, self-determination, control of their behavior, recognition of their learning and empowerment stand out. Among the main conclusions, it is highlighted that through a program focused on the elderly, the digital gap is reduced, highlighting the importance of autonomy and independence with respect to their environment, self-learning and learning by doing, as fundamental skills for today's society."

A content analysis of the media coverage is carried out in two written press media with national circulation, El Mercurio and La Tercera, as well as the regional newspaper El Austral de la Araucanía. The aim is to identify which representations these newspapers -all linked to the right, but belonging to different media conglomerates- give to this problem. The methodology used to undertake the analysis is a dual approach, blending qualitative and quantitative methods. Through this study it has been possible to formulate a more precise panorama of the main social representations created by the media in question, with respect to the actors in the conflict, namely Mapuches and large landowners; especially when the role of the victim is reversed between one case and another. La Tercera proved to be the most open a plurality of information, facilitating intercultural dialogue. El Mercurio shows a clear tendency to criminalize the Mapuche people, reinforcing prejudices and stereotypes.

Estudio comparativo de representaciones sociales femeninas en Topaze y The Clinic | KEYWORDS: graphic humour; political satire; Social representation; symbolic violence; women | ABSTRACT: The concept of Social Representation developed by Moscovici (1981) is taken in order to determine the attributes women were and are represented with, in politics based on the analysis of two historical moments distant in time. Two political satirical press media were investigated, to be analyzed over a period of one year starting in 1934 and 2016, dates coinciding with the first and last municipal elections that had a universal vote. For the first period studied, the Topaze magazine was analyzed and for the second, the weekly The Clinic. The results show that 81 years later, the woman continues being represented as an object of ridicule; contributing through this discursive practice to naturalize structural resistances that prevents the advancement of society towards equal rights; imposing and normalizing through symbolic violence, the male predominance in the most diverse spheres."

Despite sustained efforts by both the European Union and national governments over the past two decades to promote Roma inclusion, the effectiveness of these integration policies has largely been perceived as inadequate. This has been evident in the widespread exclusion experienced by Roma communities. Focusing on the Czech Republic, this article moves from examining state policies to the actions of civil society. In this context, the article explores the role played by Czech civil society organizations (CSOs) in both challenging and perpetuating racialized Roma exclusion. Building on Bourdieu’s concept of social habitus, this article expands it to a racialized social habitus framework. Through online interviews with CSOs and ethnographic fieldwork in four Czech cities, it explores the complex interplay between integration policies, civil society, and the racialized exclusion of the Czech Roma. The article illuminates how these organizations simultaneously contest and reinforce racialized perceptions of the Roma, thereby enriching scholarly dialogue on the complex dynamics of race and racism within civil society."

By not posing significant challenges to the state's neoliberal political and economic priorities, Indigenous cultural activity has been carefully channelled to meet state expectations of what constitutes urban indigeneity. Drawing on the minority and multicultural studies literature and ongoing ethnographic fieldwork, this article analyses how Mapuche civil society navigates the complexities of two relational models of state/ethnic minority interaction: ethno-bureaucracy and strategic essentialism. Although Mapuche associations have tried to accommodate their interests within the limits of neoliberal multiculturalism, the article argues that this governance model has established incentives for inclusion and exclusion in the socio-political apparatus, resulting in a fragmentation of the Mapuche associative landscape in urban Chile."
1744,6,"TITLE: Indigenising the city together: ethnic place production in Santiago de Chile | KEYWORDS: Cities; ethnic place; Indigenous peoples; Mapuche associations; urban space | ABSTRACT: The article examines the process of space appropriation and resignification by Indigenous migrant groups in cities. As a result of the repeated use of an urban space over time for cultural activities perceived as emblematic of a common identity, Indigenous individuals confer meanings onto space based on a social construction of their homeland, collectively re-signifying the space, and transforming it into what is presented as a symbolically-based ‘ethnic place’. Building on the literature of place identity and original empirical information gathered through ethnographic fieldwork in Santiago de Chile, the article discusses three different paths followed by the Mapuche to gain spaces and produce their own ethnic places in the city, namely, institutional approach, illegal land occupation and symbolic space appropriation. By doing this, the Mapuche are giving new meanings to their identity while shaping the conception of belonging to what constitutes or not the current Indigenous territory."

Mapuche associations in Santiago de Chile have implemented a series of workshops to revitalise the language and revert this trend. This article uses ethnographic data to analyse two interconnected aspects that have motivated members of Mapuche associations to participate in community language workshops, namely identity and community-building. Although they have contributed to reverse the loss of Mapuzungun in Santiago, the implementation of language workshops has been limited by a state socio-political framework that has historically reproduced colonial-based ideologies that have reinforced the subalternisation of Indigenous languages. This article highlights the dynamic interplay of Mapuzungun revitalisation with practices that reinforce coloniality."
1746,-1,"TITLE: Who Counts as an Authentic Indigenous? Collective Identity Negotiations in the Chilean Urban Context | KEYWORDS: authenticity; cities; ethnicity; hybridity; Indigenous associations; Mapuche; urban indigeneity | ABSTRACT: While increasing numbers of Indigenous peoples worldwide live in cities, mainstream research and practice continue to render urban indigeneity invisible and assume that Indigenous groups remain confined to a rural homeland. As a strategy of resistance to assimilation to their nation-states, Indigenous peoples in cities have tended to foster conceptions of ethno-cultural purity to defend their threatened cultures. Building on the literature on socio-cultural hybridity and based on ethnographic information, this article discusses the ways in which the Mapuche members of Indigenous associations in Santiago de Chile understand their indigeneity as urban dwellers. While the article reveals that the content of what counts as ‘authentic’ Mapuche-ness may vary for each individual, the Mapuche, framed by the collective participatory environment offered by their urban associations, attempt to perform, as best they can, the dominant understandings of what counts as indigeneity."

By following a relational goods approach, the article suggests that the constructed nature of ethnicity leads the Mapuche to create and join ethnic associations in an urban milieu. This study reveals that the main motivations for sustaining an active associational engagement are threefold: identity recovery struggle, leaving an identity legacy and bonding with their ethnic peers; all of these identified as relational goods. This investigation is based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted over eight months."

Una revisión sistemática de la producción española | KEYWORDS: Educational implications; Science education; Spanish journals; Systematic review; Teaching based on inquiry | ABSTRACT: Due to the growing importance given to teaching based on inquiry both at the international and national level, this article aims to further work related to this line of research published between 2007 and 2017 in the Spanish area of Didactic of Experimental Sciences. We reviewed 1941 articles, including 55 criteria for the selection, all according to the guidelines of the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The results show the most prolific authors, the evolution of scientific production, the educational stages considered, the types of studies, the designs and the educational implications of their application in the classrooms. In light of these, we can conclude that there are not many authors with an excellent production regarding this subject, because this research’s line is still incipient in Spain. The attention devoted to the different educational stages by research in Didactic of Experimental Sciences is not equitable, with the most affected being the stages of Infantile and Primary Education. There are more articles of a theoretical nature than empirical ones, given the lack of experimental studies that prove this teaching approach is patent. However, the educational implications derived from Spanish publications are similar to the international ones. Finally, we have to advocate for an increase in the number of studies aimed at evaluating the benefits of teaching based on inquiry in the different educational stages, focusing on the stages of Pre-school Education and Primary Education."

Objective: To study the transformation of the specialized knowledge of future teachers about division of fractions. Design: qualitative descriptive paradigm where a case study is approached. Context and participants: A group of three students who design, reformulate and implement mathematical tasks during their initial training in a Lesson Study environment using the Didactic Analysis method, where they receive feedback from their peers and trainer. Data collection and analysis: data collection is obtained from the written productions of future teachers and the record of recordings of class discussions, which were analyzed using the content analysis method and the categories of the specialized knowledge model. from the math teacher. Results: future teachers show a change in their knowledge, starting their process with the design of a problem situation with a different meaning in the conceptual field of division of fractions, which becomes a problem situation with a multiplicative structure of the type ""isomorphism of measure"". Conclusions: deepening the processes of transformation of the specialized knowledge of future teachers from their first formative stage can give us insights on how to improve their training aiming at their professional teaching development."

The authors start from the conception of formative process that approaches a functional view of the didactic knowledge of content, aimed at deepening on the meaning of the mathematical tasks that are involved in the lesson plans designed by future professors of three Chilean universities. From the qualitative paradigm, this research aims to show how the didactic analysis tool is useful to future teachers as a procedure to design, implement and evaluate the classes. Understanding these elements allows us to design courses more appropriate to the reality of initial training in the degrees of Chilean universities."

To better understand how capstone design experiences contribute to graduates' professional preparation, we recruited participants from four different institutions as they completed multiple-semester project-based capstone design courses. We then followed them through their first three months of work using weekly quantitative surveys about participants' work activities and perceived preparedness, and weekly reflective journal responses about significant challenges experienced. To analyze the data, we used a priori and emergent codes to identify challenges, strategies, and areas of transfer from capstone to work, in combination with frequency analysis to identify patterns across the data set. The results indicate that participants' most significant challenges centered on self-directed learning and interpersonal communication, and that capstone courses played a key role in supporting professional preparation in these areas."

The purpose of this study is to compare the attitudes of students of health sciences: nursing, medical, occupational therapy, and psychology. Methods: A comparative and cross-sectional study in which 927 final-year students from health sciences university programmes were evaluated using the Mental Illness: Clinicians’ Attitudes (both MICA-2 and MICA-4) scale. The sample was taken in six universities from Chile and Spain. Results: We found consistent results indicating that stigma varies across university programmes. Medical and nursing students showed more negative attitudes than psychology and occupational therapy students in several stigma-related themes: recovery, dangerousness, uncomfortability, disclosure, and discriminatory behaviour. Conclusions: Our study presents a relevant description of the attitudes of each university programme for education against stigma in the formative years. Results show that the biomedical understanding of mental disorders can have negative effects on attitudes, and that education based on the psychosocial model allows a more holistic view of the person over the diagnosis."
1753,13,"TITLE: ‘One nation, two languages’: representations of official languages on multilingual news websites in Belarus | KEYWORDS: Belarus; diglossia; language ideologies; Representations | ABSTRACT: This article analyses how two official languages of Belarus, Russian and Belarusian, are represented on the homepages of two national news websites through the analysis of media discourse within headlines and leads of news stories, and focusing on aspects of multimodality of websites. In view of the equal legal status of these languages, this study investigates the extent to which readers of news in Russian and Belarusian are exposed to different content, and how these differences are connected to existing language ideologies. Critical discourse analysis of textual contents of linguistic versions in combination with multimodal analysis of the websites’ layout revealed that Russian and Belarusian tend to be used differently in news on politics, culture and sports and, hence, are represented as having different values. More specifically, the media examined here present the same stories from different ideological perspectives and websites’ thematic sections include different news depending on the language of the webpage. This study demonstrated that multilingual websites represent a useful source of data for the study of language ideologies in the media. The methodological approach employed here can be replicated in other contexts characterised by bilingualism and diglossia [Fishman, Joshua A. 1967. “Bilingualism With and Without Diglossia; Diglossia With and Without Bilingualism.” Journal of Social Issues 23 (2): 29–38] linguistic situations."
1754,0,"TITLE: Exploring the Contribution of Student Engagement Factors to Mature-Aged Students’ Persistence and Academic Achievement During the First Year of University | KEYWORDS: belonging; Mature-aged students; motivation; self-efficacy; student engagement; transition | ABSTRACT: The expansion of higher education has led to greater diversity among students, with a significant portion of them aged 25 and above. This demographic group represents a range of intersecting identities associated with their different roles, responsibilities, and life trajectories. While older students face obstacles to engagement, persistence, and success, they also bring unique strengths that inform the educational experience. This research employs a quantitative approach to explore the perceptions of bachelor’s degree students regarding belonging, self-efficacy, and motivation as student engagement factors and how these perceptions influence their persistence and academic achievement during the first year, with a focus on older students. The study compares the academic achievement of mature-aged and younger students. An analysis using ordinal logistic regression indicates that age, self-efficacy, and motivation are potential predictors of academic achievement, which in turn correlates with persistence. The findings suggest that mature-aged students are more likely to perform better academically than younger students. These students report elevated confidence in their ability to study at the university level and are intrinsically motivated to learn. Based on these findings, the study discusses implications for student engagement strategies, transition and retention support, and avenues for future research."

As a vital component in the sector, international students aspire to be successful in their higher education endeavours. Within this context, student success, already a highly contested term in the field, takes a different outlook when discussed in relation to international students. This paper focuses on the meaning of international student success and the mechanisms through which this concept has been made functional by the higher education sector. Working with definitions of student success, the paper first looks at student success as it means to international students, in line with their distinctive circumstances. In the second half, factors that impact international student success are reviewed in relation to current policy instruments across leading international higher education markets. The paper concludes by pointing out important implications and quality assurance challenges in enhancing the international students' experience abroad."

The work of Movice, I suggest, is an example of how the category of “victim” from international law discourse is adopted and used from below by victims of mass atrocities. I show that, through this category, Movice attempts to introduce an alternative narrative of the internal armed conflict in which the state is a perpetrator of violence against civilian population as part of a practice of elimination of political opposition through violent means. To do this, I focus on three political opportunities in which Movice deployed the category of victim between 2005 and 2016. I suggest that Movice is an example of how a movement of victims can adopt categories of international law to frame their struggles and, in doing so, infuse them with new contents."

Building upon different academic works about this experience, I explore the Community’s usage of the category of victim. As a category coming from the discourse of international human rights, victims–and particularly victims of mass atrocity–are usually portrayed as defenceless and passive subjects. Instead, the Community embodies a group of victims full of contradictions, at the same time suffering, empowered, stubborn, and inflexible. To understand this, it is necessary to look past the mere use of international law and to consider the Community as a collective process. Here, a sense of communal identity has emerged through the struggles of war. This communal identity partly gives a content to their complex victimhood. Moreover, the new political context in Colombia brings important challenges but, it is argued, the category of victim can still be useful for the Community."

Claims have been raised against icl as a mechanism overly focused on the legal fiction of an individual perpetrator, obscuring the true collective dimension of the crimes. Despite these criticisms, icl has incorporated a mechanism to address this collective dimension, at least on the side of the victims: collective reparations. However, the emerging use of collective reparations faces important challenges in an avenue based on an individual-perpetrator logic. Here, I identify current difficulties in the early practice of collective reparations in international criminal justice. These difficulties relate mainly with procedural issues and the role of the 'adjunct mechanisms' such as the Trust Fund for Victims (tfv). I submit that these difficulties reflect the inherent tensions present in the asymmetrical treatment of the collective dimension of the crimes."
1761,0,"TITLE: Accountability from a social justice perspective: Criticism and proposals | KEYWORDS: Accountability; Assessment; Fairness; Social justice; Testing | ABSTRACT: When seen in a positive light, accountability systems are understood as a means for promoting transparency, improvement, responsibility and commitment to valuable goals, thus ensuring that State funding is invested in initiatives that are beneficial to all citizens. However, in education, there is extensive evidence about the negative effects of predominant accountability systems, which call their expected positive impacts into question. Some of the detrimental effects of these systems involve unequal distribution of knowledge as well as discrimination and stigmatisation of vulnerable students, minorities and powerless groups, and of the schools that serve them. This evidence, along with emerging demands for social justice in terms of participation and recognition, highlights the need to analyse the shortcomings of current accountability systems in connection to ideals of social justice in education. On the basis of a review of relevant literature that connects the areas of social justice, education and assessment and accountability systems, this paper aims at illustrating some of the significant challenges and potential new avenues for the development of more just and, therefore, more intelligent accountability systems."

It also analyze the factors that can explain the frequency. To do so, a quantitative perspective was used including a survey applied to sample of 650 students from 134 teacher training programs in Chile. The results indicate that the most important factors to explain the reflective practice are related to the supervisor. The factors related to the classmates and to the discussion on the teacher career have a lower contribution to the reflective practice."
1763,0,"TITLE: The consequences of metrics for social justice: tensions, pending issues, and questions | KEYWORDS: assessment; consequences; fairness; Social justice; testing | ABSTRACT: In the current scenario of expansion of neo-liberal and market-oriented policies, large-scale assessment has become an increasingly pervasive technology of power. Given their consequences, and the high stakes derived from them, assessment systems put pressure on schools to an extent where their practices and internal policies adapt to the logic of these mechanisms. The behaviours that emerge from this adaptation are seen as ‘gaming the system’ and are often portrayed as the responsibility of test users. However, the article aims at pushing the question around the consequences of metrics further, in terms of what these strategic gaming behaviours are adapting to and to what extent predominant metrics are accomplishing their assumptions of social justice. Through theoretically discussing the concept of social justice in connection with educational assessment, the paper problematises whether current metrics and their consequences, on the one hand, are able to respond to their underlying principles of equality of opportunity, which are characteristic of justice as distribution, and, on the other hand, highlights the insufficiency of these principles to respond to current developments of the concept of social justice with regard to the dimensions of recognition and participation, with considerations for their potential inclusion in future assessment systems."

Two rubrics were applied to 50 documents prepared by students in six teachers' training programs in Chile. The results show that the reflective approach of the documents analyzed concentrates only on some dimensions, and leaves out other important ones, such as reflection on the students' own lessons learned. Furthermore, the results of the analysis show, in general, a low level of reflective teaching, and differences between the programs analyzed. These differences were related to the specific and orientation students express regarding what is expected of them in each section of the prepared document."
1765,7,"TITLE: Migrating a Flock of Outsiders: Platform Affordances and Political Goals in the Chilean Constitutional Reform | KEYWORDS: Affordances; collective action; democratic listening; discord; political engagement | ABSTRACT: Nowadays social media platforms are popular venues for political participation, especially for those more distrustful of traditional institutions. However, the specific dynamics between users’ motivations, platform affordances, and their effectiveness in achieving political and civic goals remain somewhat unclear. In this article, we explore the motivations and expectations of political outsiders to challenge their peripheral condition and how they leverage platform affordances to do so, using the case of the Chilean constitutional process (2021–2022). Specifically, we delve into the collective adoption of Discord, a platform initially designed for gamers, as a tool for pursuing democratic advances. Employing a multimethod strategy that involves netnography, focus groups, and interviews, we examine the motivations, strategies, and goals among a group of Chilean outsiders as they engage with the ongoing political process. We found the construction of a rich and complex collaborative and informative environment influenced and shaped by a combination of individual and collective drivers. Notably, the feeling of being heard by independent representatives emerged as a prominent factor for their political engagement. The “flock” of citizens engaged with Discord using mainly four key collective affordances in-practice: coordination, cooperativism, moderation, and customization. Implications and limitations are discussed."
1766,11,"TITLE: Latent bombs of disinformation | KEYWORDS: Brazil; Chile; Disinformation; elections; Latin America; Telegram | ABSTRACT: This study builds on the literature on disinformation and conspiracy theories to propose the concept of Latent Bombs of Disinformation (LBD). LBD refers to a long-term antidemocratic political strategy involving the persistent dissemination of misleading information, designed to be activated under specific conditions. The framework operationalizes LBD at three levels: macro (e.g., institutional strength), meso (e.g., media catalysts), and micro (e.g., media consumption habits). Using the 2021 presidential election in Chile and the 2022 election in Brazil as case studies, we analyze ‘electoral fraud’ narratives based on data from legacy media publications and fringe, politically aligned Telegram groups supporting losing parties, spanning the period between the first ballot and the run-off. The results highlight key differences: Brazil experienced vandalism, whereas Chile did not. Additionally, we identified evidence of coordinated activity on Telegram in Brazil but not in Chile. We contextualize these findings, discuss their implications, and suggest avenues for future research."
1767,7,"TITLE: How different patterns of online participation reflect internal, external, and online efficacy: the case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; latent class analysis; online political engagement; political attitudes; Political efficacy | ABSTRACT: Recent research extensively examines the impact of political efficacy on online and offline political engagement, but those studies often overlook the multifaceted types of political engagement. This study addresses this gap by investigating the association between internal, external, and online political efficacy with the different types of online political engagement, using Chile as a case study. Using Latent Class Analysis, we identify five patterns of online political participants (clicktivist, super, disengaged, selective, and expressive citizens). Subsequently, we explore the relationship between internal, external, and online political efficacy with the five patterns of online participants. Multinomial logistic regressions reveal that internal efficacy exhibits no significant relationship with online political participation. In turn, external efficacy is associated with a higher probability of being a super and expressive citizen, and online efficacy is associated with a higher probability of being a super, expressive, or clicktivist citizen. These findings shed light on the complex relationship between political efficacy and online political engagement, highlighting the impact of measurement choices on the observed relationship between these variables in prior studies."

Doing a content analysis on most circulated messages on 300 WhatsApp and 42 Telegram chats two months before an electoral process in Chile, we explore an initial approach to a comparative study on the patterns of political information interchange with a particular focus on the magnitude, types and content of misinformation circulated on both platforms in Chile within politically oriented right-leaning groups on both platforms. Among the differences between platforms, we find that while WhatsApp is being used by the groups aligned with more extreme right-wing positions to coordinate campaigns, debate the contingency and spread both info and misinformation, Telegram is centred on deeper conspiratorial groups that merge national and international contingency, UN rejection and anti-vaccine, anticommunist discourse and radical calls for action such as the mobilization for a military coup."
1769,-1,"TITLE: Affordances-driven ethics for research on mobile instant messaging: Notes from the Global South | KEYWORDS: affordances; Brazil; Chile; digital research; Ethics; mobile instant messaging; WhatsApp | ABSTRACT: Mobile instant messaging (MIM) applications have received increasing attention from social science researchers lately. Despite the high frequency of its use for multiple purposes, research in such environments entails specific ethical challenges, more familiar for researchers from the Global South, where MIMs have become an important part of the media landscape for a decade or so. This article discusses the ethical dilemmas that emerged in two distinct cases where authors were part of the research teams, concluding that current frameworks fall short in the sociotechnical dimension. To address this, we complement the casuistic-heuristic model with an affordances-driven approach, which contemplates the agency of the group members within the interactive processes that take place in digital environments and the possibilities and constraints that platforms' features offer during the research process."

Several of the most methodologically sound studies find small to nonexistent effects. However, extant research is limited by focusing on few platforms (usually Facebook, Twitter or YouTube) and is heavily U.S. centered. This leaves open the possibility that other platforms, such as those that rely on visual communication (e.g., Instagram) or are tailored to strong-tie network communication (e.g., WhatsApp), are more influential. Furthermore, the few studies conducted in other countries suggest that social media use increases political misperceptions. Still, these works use cross-sectional designs, which are ill suited to dealing with omitted variable bias and temporal ordering of processes. Using a two-wave survey fielded in Mexico during the 2021 midterm elections (N = 596), we estimate the relationship between frequency of news exposure on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp, and belief in political misinformation, while controlling for both time-invariant and time-dependent individual differences. In contrast to political discussion, information literacy and digital skills, none of the social platforms analyzed exhibits a significant association with misinformed beliefs. We also tested for possible indirect, moderated, and reciprocal relationships, but none of these analyses yielded a statistically significant result. We conclude that the study is consistent with the “minimal media effects” paradigm, which suggests that efforts to address misinformation need to go beyond social platforms."

Four complementary case studies in Chile are analyzed in an extraordinary period characterized by an unusually frequent political activity in the country’s history, following 2019’s social outburst amidst and after the sanitary crisis brought by COVID-19. The examples of different operations of the Influence Industry are organized and discussed in three dimensions: (1) actors, (2) tactics and (3) political consequences, and finally these dimensions will be situated within the regional context, to identify continuities and discontinuities in the changing landscape of Latin American Influence Industries in relation to the aforementioned three dimensions. By doing so, the chapter systematizes press research of the period and available literature on the state of the industries of influence in the region, as well as makes an analytical contribution by identifying some differentiating characteristics within it."

The debate over the modern condition of the region and the contradictions of enlightenment values shaping a land conquered by the sword provides the backdrop for evaluating the pertinence of Habermas’s The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere in the region, specifically regarding the chances the subaltern has to speak. Acknowledging its modern imprint and the varied criticisms it has received, the notion of the public sphere a la Habermas, offers a set of criteria for assessing the processes and outcomes of media and public communication development in Latin America. In this sense, this article connects the colonial imprint of Latin American nations, its struggles over media power, the meaning of communication, and the arrival of the Internet and Web 2.0 in the region through the notion of the public sphere. This overview exposes the features of the Internet in Latin America that perpetuate inequality, injustice, and the lack of voice while raising questions about the actual life of the “public” as a concept in the region."

While Uruguay and Chile boast more digitized societies, Brazil and Argentina’s size and geopolitical influence create distinct technological landscapes. The adoption and cultural components of technological innovation are influenced by economic, political, and media systems, resulting in customized political outcomes. Digital technologies, such as mobile communication and social media, intervene in processes of political participation, polarization, social unrest, and other phenomena through algorithmic biases and trend detection mechanisms. Examining various forms of technologically mediated political participation, including computational propaganda, misinformation, digital activism, and digital surveillance, this chapter explores continuities and discontinuities that define the digital political ecosystems in these countries."

A significant asymmetry in activity was identified between progressive and conservative groups, with the latter presenting habits more related to information disorders. The findings thus suggest a strong tendency for users with values aligned with the political right to spread conspiracy theories and false facts, mixing politics and health; national with international. Progressive groups, in comparison, show a more informative activity while conservatives display a tendency to privilege opinion content. It highlights the importance of investigating closed digital environments and disinformation in contexts that make verification and public scrutiny difficult."

As Russian authorities enforced a legal blockage to Instant Messenger Telegram during the past 2 years, many users kept using the app seamlessly thanks to what we call a subversive affordance: a built-in proxy functionality that allows users to seamlessly circumvent the blockage. We claim it is subversive because it allows users to overcome the blockage as the consequence of the app’s development, with a significant fraction of users who did not have to take action to bypass the blockage. By conducting an online survey and performing a meta-cluster analysis, we found a group we labeled the undeprived: people that, despite presenting traits frequently associated with digital divides—such as gender, age, and low levels of digital skills—were able to keep using the app."

Rooted on the crossroads of UGC and Witnessing studies, this article provides a definition and a proposition of operationalization of tUGC in a case analysis, using two protests against former Brazilian president Rousseff’s impeachment in 2016 as case of study. Results suggest three main patterns of tUGC production, named as political, journalistic and expressive. Quantitative analysis points to a high frequency of production but to low levels of diffusion of tUGC overall in the context of the analysed case. Finally, results suggest external factors seem to have effect on general patterns of tUGC production and circulation. Discussion and further developments are offered."

Efectos de la ideología, educación y medios alternativos en comportamientos de verificación | KEYWORDS: alternative news media; belief gap; confirmation bias; fact-checking; survey research | ABSTRACT: When confronted with suspicious information, the most common advice is to rely on trusted, well-known news media outlets to verify it. However, in a high-choice, fragmented media ecosystem, news readers might easily find a source that confirms what they previously thought about an issue, or debunks reports that challenge their values and beliefs. As such, alternative news outlets might be a feasible venue for citizens to confront cross-cutting information. At the same time, avoiding contrary information or actively seeking different points of view depends on personal characteristics, such as ideology or education. Drawing upon the belief gap hypothesis, this study observes how alternative news media use, together with people’s education and political ideology, affect citizens’ fact-checking behaviors when encountering challenging information. Results from a two-wave panel study conducted in Chile suggest that ideology plays a role only for the highly educated, who tend to fact-check the most when they are closer to the left side of the political spectrum."

Intriguingly, though, the invisible affordance was made visible with an individual message to each conversation. In this research, we “properly scrutinize” the roll-out of the affordance in historical perspective inspired by the “platform biography” approach, critically comparing corporate and media documentation with an analysis of the attributes and affordances that refer to the realm of privacy and security with focus on the end-to-end encryption. After pointing the contradictions with evidences found, we conclude that the implementation should be interpreted neither as a plain idealistic saga for user privacy and security by the App’s founders nor as simply a market-oriented approach—though both are clearly components of the company’s motives—but as a strategic move inserted in a: (1) Public Relations guerrilla strategy from WhatsApp Inc. facing national States and respective intelligence agencies or law enforcement institutions, in which context the development and implementation of affordances reveals a (2) power move by corporate digital media to avoid political conflict against vigilante state power and therefore the App’s subsistent vulnerabilities in terms of privacy and security should be read as (3) a tradeoff between commercial massiveness at the expense of technological utopia."

Precisely, OL has been presented as an alternative in the historical context originated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created an unexpected situation for social structures and their educational institutions. The main goals of the study was to know about the students' perceptions of the educational use of ICTs and educational technologies in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some specific objectives of the research were (i) to identify the disposition of the students towards the use of ICTs, (ii) to characterize the Interaction with others through the use of ICTs, and to (iii) identify the interaction of the students with LMS and ICTs. An in-depth theoretical review allowed the authors of this paper to construct an instrument to measure students' perceptions about the use of ICTs and educational technologies in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The general objective of the present research is to know the perceptions and evaluations of students at a Chilean public university about the ""emergency"" online learning process that occurred in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on several previous works related to online learning (OL), an instrument (questionnaire) was developed and implemented with the participation of 117 students. The research is quantitative-descriptive and had the following specific objectives: (1) To determine the attitude of university students towards EOL; (2) To characterize the learning experience of students in online modality; (3) To know about the available resources of students for EOL; and (4) To validate the developed questionnaire through a factor structure analysis. In general, the results show that students are proficient in the aspects related to self-management of learning, but have a low level of motivation for EOL and suffer a deficit in aspects related to interaction with others (teachers and peers). These results provide a first approximation of Chilean students' perceptions of EOL and allow us to identify several aspects that should be improved by professors and university authorities.

1785,0,"TITLE: Online engineering education: A proposal for specialization of the teacher training in engineering | KEYWORDS: Distance learning; IGIP curricula; Online engineering pedagogy; University teacher training | ABSTRACT: The context of the COVID-19 pandemic produced new immediate needs in the field of university teaching related to distance learning and forces the universities to transform their “traditional” face-to-face teaching methods, particularly with the implementation of online education. This situation represented a challenge not only for the universities but also for the teachers because they need to transform their teaching work in the classroom to online strategies for online learning environments. To meet these needs for effective online education an online pilot training course in Engineering Education based on the IGIP Curriculum of the TU Dresden was designed and implemented. The course “Introduction to online teaching and learning in engineering” (in Spanish: “Introducción a la Enseñanza-Aprendizaje Online en Ingeniería”) consisted of 4 modules implemented on a mix of online communication strategy of synchronous activities carried out on the Zoom platform, together with asynchronous work on a Moodle-based LMS platform. The course was offered between May and June 2020 for a group of academics of the Faculty of Engineering of a public Chilean University. This paper describes the designed online pilot training course in Engineering Pedagogy and presents the results of the evaluation of its implementation. For this a survey was applied and filled by the participants to evaluate the course and to know their perceptions about their competencies development to improve online learning in engineering."

In Eastern Europe, particularly in the Russian Federation, the tradition of EP has more than 20 years and shows an extensive network of universities actively participating in IGIP (International Society of Engineering Pedagogy). Several universities offer the IGIP curricula and work on various projects related to majoring in engineering education and pedagogy in Russian Higher Education Institutions. In Spanish-speaking countries the concept of EP is relatively recent. Particularly, since 2014, the Technical University of Dresden (TU Dresden) works in cooperation with Chilean universities to strengthen engineering pedagogy and education in the university context. This goal was concretized through two cooperation projects “Engineering Didactics at Chilean Universities” (PEDING-Project) and “Strengthening engineering training at Chilean universities through practice partner-ships” (STING-Project), both financially supported by DAAD. The main goal of this paper is to present the results of a survey about teaching needs in engineering pedagogy in a Chilean university. In general, the results showed the high level of interest and motivation that a training course on engineering pedagogy specifically oriented for the academic staff of engineering faculties may have. The project was led by the International Center of Engineering Education (CIEI) at the University of Talca (Chile) under the pedagogical support of the TU Dresden (Germany)."

The research questions that guided the research process were: (i) How do the participants evaluate the course in general? (ii) How do the participants evaluate the didactic design of the course? (iii) How do they evaluate the teaching competencies? (iv) How do they value the usefulness of the learning outcomes for their teaching practice? (v) How they self-evaluate their participation and their learning process? Based on different authors a questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions was developed and implemented online. For the statistical analysis was applied an exploratory-descriptive analysis. The training course consists of two online modules with 90 working hours in LMS, and was designed by the Center of Engineering Education (CIEI) at the University of Talca, according to the IGIP Curricula of the IGIP center at the Technische Universität Dresden (TU Dresden, Germany). From the first results of the pilot project, it can be noted that there is a high level of motivation and interest to participate in a teaching training course based on EP, which has been specially oriented and designed to meet the specific requirements of the academic staff of engineering schools."

The new demands of the society and the economy, the constant specializations of the scientific fields, and the incorporation of new technologies for teaching and learning make that the typical contemporary forms for the teacher academic training must be reviewed and analyzed. The main goal of this paper is to present the results of a survey about teaching needs on Engineering Pedagogy in engineering departments of INACAP (a Chilean university of applied sciences). In general, the instrument and indicators seek to obtain information about: (i) needs/demands related to engineering didactic fundamentals, (ii) requirements for the structuring and assessment of teaching-learning processes in a university context, (iii) requirements for the design and evaluation of face-to-face as well as online teaching-learning activities in engineering, among others. The project was led by the International Center of Engineering Education (CIEI) at the University of Talca (Chile) in cooperation with the academic staff of INACAP at the Talca campus, under the pedagogical support of the Technische Universität Dresden (Germany), Faculty of Education. Based on these research results and on the IGIP Curricula, a teacher training program for the academic staff of the engineering schools in online modality was designed and implemented."

Specialized literature in this field focuses on four main themes: the impact of the neoliberal model on housing policies, the issue of property and renting, the maintenance of shantytowns, and issues of space and architecture. While there is consensus on the positive impact of social policies on access to housing for low-income families, debates persist regarding poverty and marginality. The research employs the Occupational and Unemployment Survey of Gran Santiago conducted by the Microdata Center of the University of Chile, administered quarterly since 1957 in all districts of Gran Santiago, with an annual survived population of around 10 000 individuals and 2 000 to 3 000 family groups. The findings reveal that: 1) the reduction in the relative cost of housing is more significant in non-poor households than in poor households; 2) in comparison to the international average, there is a decrease in the relative cost from 2000 to 2010, followed by an increase between 2011 and 2017; 3) the relative cost rises in impoverished sectors, particularly in the bottom 10% of income earners; 4) the reduction in relative cost is more pronounced in rented homes than in owned ones."

Finally, we study the previous conditions that ended up in the nationalization of the coal industry in 1970. This research shows how the problem of the coal industry in this period is that the growth of the Chilean economy was lower than what their productive sectors needed."

In comparative terms, the nitrate sector did not lag behind and the true crisis, as far as wages are concerned, did not take place until the early 1960s. It is argued that previous literature has overlooked the importance of those who stayed in the nitrate industries after the economic crisis due to a historiographical attitude that could be termed as ‘methodological centralism’: the idea that regional realities are only relevant when they are connected to the state-making process."

The main hypothesis is that the Chilean state was partially able to take advantage of the monetary-financial difficulties provoked by the global breakdown of the gold standard and assure quotas of saltpeter production, on the one hand, and reactivate the payments of private debt, on the other hand. The research shows that clearing agreements and the new saltpeter policy mirrored a process of reorganization of the interconnexions between state agencies and the private sector."

Four periods are examined: the preindustrial, characterized by the circulation of silver in a sino-centric commercial world (1492-1815); the gold standard, in which fiat money convertible into gold and issued by central banks emerged as the main medium of exchange (1815-1914); the gold-exchange standard, in which the US dollar replaced gold as the international payment medium (1914-1971); and the present period, based on floating exchange rates and inconvertible fiat money (1917-present). The hypothesis is that functional differentiation of the economic system has contributed to the transformation and re-adaptation of global inequality to new and more complex scenarios."

It is argued that crises correspond to a social alarm, as regulatory devices that the social agents activate to change the social structure (morphogenesis) or to preserve it (morfoestasis). We propose that crises unfold when the distance between the promises of the shareholders and the expectations of the stakeholders has surpassed a critical threshold of tolerance, which propagates the experience of crisis within and between three social planes: in the coordinated or uncoordinated civil society, at organizational scale, and systemic-institutional level. As for its functionality, social crises mainly correct social disintegration (its perceptive dimension) and only in a tangential way the systemic disintegration (its objective dimension). The theoretical approaches are illustrated through a case study that analyzes two Chilean crises: the pension crisis and the crisis of political disaffection."

For its formulation, we consider the Comognitive Theory of Anna Sfard as the main reference. It is a framework for the didactics of mathematics that offers an epistemological position on the development of human knowledge. Along with this, we present a selection of theoretical and empirical approaches that describe interdisciplinary practices in professional and academic contexts. From this theoretical basis, we propose a definition of interdisciplinary process and distinguish the different observable comognitive actions during the interaction of the participants of said process. This essay ends with some reflections that may be useful in making decisions associated with the implementation of interdisciplinary experiences in higher education."

Both music and sound can synergically act as scaffolding for learning, intervening as part of situated knowledge, and they could offer a new perspective for learning mathematics at schools, giving pupils opportunities to develop their own mental representations. Also, the incorporation of an affective/emotional analysis, as criteria for evaluation, seems pertinent and complementary to other criteria in the production of multimedia material with educational purposes both in formal and non-formal domains of education. These are the intentions of the present work, which shows the design, implementation and assessment of AudioFractions, as part of an educational software package called Sound Interactive Music- Mathematics, which was conceived to aid mathematical learning through sound and music in Chilean Primary Education. The investigation was carried out in a three-stage design: 1) generate significant metaphors; 2) implement and test functional software prototypes and didactic guidelines; and 3) assess the software. Pupils in risk of social exclusion at three priority public schools in Santiago de Chile (N=137; 9-11 years old) were subjected to AudioFractions in one 60-minute session. Then, students filled a questionnaire validated by experts with their perceptions about the software and their emotions. Results of the four assessment variables (global, technical, mathematical, musical) plus an affective-emotional assessment, show an excellent reception of AudioFractions."

While these modular solutions were designed as resources for the classroom, students outside of that context can use them too. The process followed a methodology in several stages in order to generate multi-modal functional prototypes, together with their respective didactic guides, that link music and mathematics. These prototypes have been put through an iterative evaluation process leading up their final version. Results indicate an excellent reception of the proposal by students. All evaluated dimensions of the software - math learning, music learning, global, technical, and affective-emotional- have received excellent scores. El proyecto PicaLab propone el diseño, elaboración y evaluación de recursos informáticos modulares para la enseñanza y el aprendizaje de contenidos matemáticos a través del sonido y la música, para los niveles de tercero, cuarto y quinto año del sistema educacional primario de Chile.

El proceso siguió una metodología en diferentes etapas con el fin de diseñar prototipos funcionales de naturaleza multimodal en conjunto con sus guías didácticas. Estos prototipos fueron sometidos a un proceso iterativo de evaluación hasta alcanzar su versión final. Los resultados de valoración de la presente propuesta por parte del alumnado muestran una excelente recepción, con puntuaciones muy altas en todas las dimensiones: global, técnica, afectiva-emocional y valoración para el aprendizaje matemático y musical."

However, FOIA impflementation has not been without criticism, specifically for the information request system and the administrative burdens it can create for local governments. Based on the theoretical premises of both citizen participation and public transparency, this article focuses on supply and demand variables that could predict the use of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to municipalities in Chile. The results show that municipal income, social and political participation, poverty rate and, to some extent, local compliance with information disclosure can predict the number of FOI requests to a municipality. These findings provide new evidence on FOI request usage, providing public policy recommendations to improve FOIA implementation in local governments."
1803,0,"TITLE: Action research for character development in 18 classrooms in Latin America: reflections, learnings and challenges | KEYWORDS: action research; Character education; moral development; virtues | ABSTRACT: The article describes and analyzes the process of implementation of an action-research project on character education led by 18 Latin American teachers. For the project a training methodology was created by which teachers designed, implemented and evaluated a series of classroom interventions reflecting independently and as a group on the best strategies to explicitly work on the virtue development of their students. The project also provided insights into the incipient progress of character education in Latin America and its potential growth. This process overcame a series of challenges such as teachers´ difficulties when conducting empirical research and the lack of knowledge about character education among teachers and their communities. By engaging in action research, teachers actively contributed to generating local knowledge about virtue cultivation across 18 diverse educational contexts. This reflexive process revealed that action research was a powerful mechanism for rethinking and co-creating more context-sensitive, evidence-based educational practices. Because of this, it is recommended to consider action research as a process to design and evaluate more solid educational interventions, especially in areas that require a systematic inquiry and evidence production, such as those centered on character development."

However, there is limited evidence regarding its impact on the democratization of public management at both national and local levels. This article presents a systematic review of the literature aimed at identifying the effects of the OGP on the democratic governance of its members, which is defined through three key dimensions: (1) legitimacy, (2) effectiveness, and (3) social justice. Additionally, potential explanatory variables for the observed changes are also explored. The findings reveal that the OGP positively affects democratic governance. Still, these are contingent on specific conditions, such as the active participation of social actors and the institutional strength of its members. These results raise doubts about the OGP's capacity to drive meaningful change in contexts characterized by low social support or weak institutional frameworks."
1805,11,"TITLE: Determinants of Access to Information Requests: Analysis of the Municipalities of the Los Ríos Region, Chile Factores determinantes de solicitudes de acceso a la información: análisis de las municipalidades de la región de Los Ríos, Chile | KEYWORDS: access to information; access to information laws; access to information requests; local government; Transparency | ABSTRACT: Freedom of Information (FOI) requests have become a daily task for officials at all levels of government, thanks to the emergence of access to information laws in the last decade. However, we know little about variables that can explain why one municipality receives more applications than another. Starting from theoretical premises about transparency and access to public information, this article seeks to identify variables associated with the number of FOI requests to a municipality. To do this, a quantitative analysis is carried out, contrasting the number of FOI requests carried out in municipalities in the Los Ríos Region (Chile) with data on social, political, and administrative variables of these communes for eight consecutive years. The results indicate that compliance with active transparency requirements, political participation, and fiscal autonomy are associated with the number of information requests made to the municipalities studied. These results would be a first approach to the determinants of FOI requests at the municipal level and allow us to point out new lines of research for the future."

Whilst the theory and practice of cyber-wisdom education is established, to date there has been no attempt to investigate how the virtue of cyber-wisdom might be measured. This is a lacuna as it limits future research in the area, including, in particular, proximal evaluations of cyber-wisdom interventions. This article introduces a new four-component measure of cyber-wisdom, which is relevant to how the virtue may be cultivated in practice via formal education and the teaching of what is generally referred to as digital citizenship education. The measure was piloted with 1,331 13–16 year-olds. The findings provide initial evidence that cyber-wisdom literacy, reasoning, reflection, and motivation can be measured. This study provides preliminary validation of cyber-wisdom sub-measures that might be used in evaluations of educational interventions that seek to help children and adolescents live with wisdom in the digital age."

This double feature has encouraged the creation of several public organizations with a strong territorial vocation, and public innovations have been developed in subnational public management to improve emergency containment, recovery, or reconstruction when necessary. However, even if strong local and subnational governments are considered essential for risk prevention, it seems that the occurrence of extreme events tends to reinforce fiscal centralism, and not to empower local administrations. This article analyses the budgetary effects of extreme events on the relationship between the central government and the Chilean regions between 1992 and 2022. For this, a measurement is designed to compare the amount of money invested by the sixteen regional governments versus the central government's investment in each region over three decades, putting a special focus on years with extreme events. The results show that central investment increases in regions where extreme events are highly destructive, which reinforces fiscal centralism. This goes in the opposite direction to current risk prevention literature, which points to the need for strong subnational governments capable of facing extreme situations."

For this, a group of local officers with experience bidding to the Fondo de Desarrollo Regional (fndr) was interviewed. Regardless of its local relevance the competition for capital funds has been commonly scrutinized from a hierarchical perspective isolated from the administrative processes that took place before and after the fund’s distribution. The article shows that the competition for fndr funds, despite securing the social return of investment, would favour better-off municipalities with larger populations jeopardizing the accomplishment of its objectives. Also, local projects would tend to seek central government compliance at the expense of what was locally proposed, evidencing an asymmetry between local and central officers. Finally, the competition would encourage the design of projects from a smaller magnitude and more visible for the community, thus affecting the development of the municipalities and the communities that inhabit them."

This article considers three potential barriers to parents/teachers forming such partnerships: i) differing views on the importance of character compared to academic attainment; ii) their prioritisation of moral, performance, civic and intellectual virtues; and iii) their prioritisation of different moral theories in ethical decision making. The article describes the findings from a quantitative study conducted with 376 parents and 137 teachers. The study found that both parents and teachers prioritise character over academic attainment but perceive the opposite to be true of their counterpart. Further, both parents and teachers rank moral virtues, such as honesty, as the most important, followed by performance virtues, such as resilience. The findings are significant as they illuminate a possible gap between parents and teachers in England, which, if addressed, will ensure children and young people are more likely to develop character qualities that contribute to individual and societal flourishing. Given that several countries are (re)introducing character education into the curriculum, the results of the study also have international significance."

To do so, we designed a web survey that draws inspiration from care theories emerging from the field of Science and Technology Studies or STS. Such an approach allowed thinking about care as a more-than-human affair that goes beyond a particular moral stance and corresponds more with a doing anchored in the entanglements of human and non-human actors. Data gathered revealed the appearance of new actors while stressing that care is much too relevant and complex to only rest upon specific household members–namely women–who are left to their own devices since policies implemented seem to be unable to support them in the tasks of caring for themselves and others."
1813,0,"TITLE: Teaching character; cultivating virtue perception and virtue reasoning through the curriculum | KEYWORDS: Character; curriculum; reasoning; virtue | ABSTRACT: Given the increased interest in character education across the world, educators are seeking guidance for their practice. This paper seeks to add to the evidence base about if and how character can be taught by discussing the results of a pilot evaluation (n=527) of a curriculum intervention designed to enhance two components of character: virtue perception and virtue reasoning. After the intervention, the participants had improved virtue perception and reasoning scores compared to the control group. Further, female students scored higher in the pilot than their male counterparts. The results demonstrate how educating these components of character might be possible, providing evidence for a debate that goes back to Aristotle and today is keenly debated in academic, policy and practice circles. The findings are significant as they provide evidence as to how character might be taught through and within the programmes of study of existing curriculum subjects."

Individual time series models were constructed to capture each participant's unique relationship between valued action and mood. The models were then meta-analyzed, revealing substantial variability, with two subgroups; Stoics (n = 64) and Non-Stoics (n = 70). The Stoics subgroup showed null or negative links between valued action and mood, replicating past findings from a nonclinical sample. The Non-Stoic group engaged significantly more in valued actions characterized by enjoyment and relaxation. Subsequent multilevel VAR networks were created to examine differences between Stoics and Non-Stoics. Within-person analyses indicated that, unlike Non-Stoics, Stoics showed no significant association between valued action and mood in contemporaneous networks. Temporal networks revealed that, for Non-Stoics, mood positively influenced future engagement in valued action. These findings challenge assumptions of a universally positive relationship between valued action and mood, suggesting divergent paths to well-being based on individual differences in mood-action dynamics."

The commune is a sacrificial zone marked by the high presence of extractive mining companies. The notion of sacrifice, worked theoretically from different authors, gi-ves rise to the analysis of the sacrificial practices to which women resort to face the effects of sacrifice in their lives daily. In this way, qualitative research is proposed, with a narrative and exploratory approach, carried out through a case study. Based on semi-structured narrative interviews, we inquired into the sacrificial practices developed by the participants of the study. The sample consisted of women, participants of social groups and organizations. The results revealed a series of sacrificial practices, in addition to the habituation and normalization of environmental sacrifice, as well as possibilities of resistance."
1816,-1,"TITLE: Social Work students’ perceptions of human rights in Chile Percepción de estudiantes de Trabajo Social sobre derechos humanos en Chile | KEYWORDS: Education for Human Rights; Higher Education; Human Rights; Social and Economic Rights; Social Work | ABSTRACT: Introduction. In 2023, amidst a period of profound relativisation and denial of Fundamental Rights, Chile commemorated 50 years of the civil-military dictatorship. During the October 2019 revolt, serious human rights violations were committed by agents of the State, most of which have not reached judicial closure. In this context, the latest survey of the National Institute of Human Rights indicates that the population negatively perceives the country’s guarantee and protection of human rights. This factor is relevant considering three decades of transitional justice and the human rights commitments undertaken by the Chilean State. Human Rights Education aimed at creating a culture of respect for human rights and generating an education of freedom that combats all forms of discrimination and violence constitutes a significant training component of Social Work, a human rights profession. The literature signals, nevertheless, various difficulties in truly incorporating this approach in educational trajectories and projects. Methodology. An exploratory and quantitative study was conducted of the human rights perceptions of students enrolled in a state university Social Work degree in the north of Chile. An online questionnaire was administered to a simple random sample (154 cases) with a 95% margin of error. The instrument was structured around open-ended, multiple-choice, and ordinal questions which were subsequently processed and analysed. Results. A positive perception of human rights was found. They were understood to be a tool enabling the protection of people’s dignity, and were associated with concepts such as equality, dignity, respect, and freedom. However, a negative perception of the guarantee of human rights was also encountered, a finding which is consistent with national results and other perception surveys implemented in Argentina. In relation to human rights training, the participants positively valued the knowledge provided in the Social Work degree. They requested, however, more elements to identify recourse instances when observing violations and more training in specific enforceability tools. Discussion. According to the evidence in the literature, the results coincide with other studies that have shown favourable human rights perceptions, while identifying a series of violations, especially in Economic and Social Rights. Thus, there is a clear need to link human rights training with daily Social Work practice through active methodologies. This would allow ensuring the training of critical agents capable of assuming the defence and promotion of human rights. Conclusions. It is necessary to advance in the strengthening of Human Rights Education in Social Work from a critical perspective. Considering the country’s context of neoliberal rationality, concrete tools must be provided allowing to fully exercise and guarantee the necessary rights."

Although said environmental institutionality arises in ""democracy"", its legal bases must be sustained on a series of legal norms that shaped the neoliberal state founded on dictatorship. Theoretical framework: The Governmentality Approach affirms that there is a complex network of power relations, supported by political economy as primordial knowledge, which allows this power to be exercised to guide the behavior of the population, through different mechanisms and concrete and practical devices. Method: Through a discourse analysis of a legal and political documentary corpus, it is evident that the bases of the neoliberal state operate as a condition of possibility for the establishment of an environmental institutionalism that through its discursive practices operates as an adequate device for the principles of the neoliberal model. Results and conclusions: It is concluded that, in the environmental institutions created in the 1990s, a series of discursive objects, created previously, are reformulated, which encourage the neoliberal treatment of the environmental issue, specifically through new legal tools such as LGBMA. (19,300) and the environmental evaluation regulation (1997). Research implications: Identifies the limitations and contradictions of the State's environmental management; within the framework of a neoliberal political economic model like the Chilean one. Originality/value: Contributes to the use of discursive historical analysis methodologies through specific fields such as the environment, through archival material that allows us to understand the specific practices of the State from the perspective of a history of the present of neoliberal governmentality."

In this sense, the present work aims to contribute to the discussion on some unknowns, uncertainties and tensions that are woven around the historical conformation of this concept in our country and, based on this, discuss and expand the generally accepted criteria for classification from the slaughter areas. To put this discussion into context, the case of maritime industrialization within Reloncaví, Los Lagos region, is studied as a potential sacrifice zone, especially in two highly industrialized sectors: San José in the Calbuco commune and Chinquihue. from the commune of Puerto Montt."

This article focuses on understanding the impact of the phenomenon on psychological well-being and quality of life in the inhabitants of an artisanal fishing community in the region. It was worked with grounded theory, interviewing twelve leaders of community and fishing organizations. The following categories are defined: Collective well-being, emotional perceptions of the process they went through and future post-catastrophe projections of the community. The results indicate people and organizations show resilience to these crises, through mechanisms such as social cohesion, empathy and willingness to change. This research is expected to provide relevant information allowing adequate intervention and preventive plans for people, their families, and community."

However, the literature has consistently focused on the effects of teachers’ beliefs on immigrant students’ academic achievements, omitting other factors such as the effect on students’ social interactions. Based on cases from Chile, this article examines the attitudes, prejudices, and beliefs that school staff have regarding immigrant students and how these images affect immigrants’ relationships with their Chilean peers. I relied on 75 in-depth interviews with students and school staff and 46 classroom observations from seven high schools in the Metropolitan Region of Chile. Results show that national origin-based stereotypes shape the way that educators see and understand immigrant students’ relationships with their peers. Moreover, these national-based stereotypes directly alter immigrant students’ integration with their Chilean peers by reinforcing Chilean students’ prejudices towards their immigrant peers and by affecting immigrants’ self-identity, confidence, and well-being."

From January to December 2016, a total of 507 articles from three mainstream newspapers were analyzed. The findings show a dual discourse on immigration in the Chileans press: a criminalization of immigrants, which frame them as delinquents, deviant, and dangerous people, and a positive and more humanizing discourse, which portrays them as people who deserve to be protected by the Chilean society. The study also finds a shift in the way media sources are representing immigration compared to previous reports, characterized by presenting alternative images of migrants, a more cautious use of language, and increased attention to the voices of governmental and religious leaders. Nevertheless, this shift has also intensified the “difference” and “otherness” of foreigners in Chile by repeatedly focusing on their nationality and differentiating between the “good” and “bad” immigrants."

In order to unpack this perspective, we present how their poetic exploration of ontological and epistemological questions about Latin/South America led to their performance of the Travesía de Amereida (1965), a radical poetic journey oriented around crossing and being crossed by the continental interior lands, and to the subsequent invention of the epic poem Amereida (1967). By examining the different Acts performed during the Travesía and analysing excerpts from the poem, we establish how the School situated actions together with the tropes of the unknown, or not-knowing, and the Interior Sea, as original ways to critically confront and question the coloniality imposed upon and still present in the continent. Concomitantly, we stress how this geo-poetic perspective grounded within the School generated a radical turn and delinking of the academicist episteme in design, which provides stimulating perspectives not only for design studies developed in the region but also for the field of cultural studies."

In this account, this article examines the geo-poetic mapping developed by the Valparaiso School of Architecture, as a radical means of exploring the territories and elaborating their palimpsestic representations. This contribution unfolds the geo-poetic vision of the South American continent created in the sixties by the School of Valparaiso, in Chile, as fundamental groundwork to critically question the historic and ongoing urban occupation of territories and their representations following colonization. Besides, it presents the Travesias de Amereida, a collective and situated architectural study performed throughout the vast South American inland, as a unique geo-poetic practice in which freehand mapping becomes an original means of rethinking and redrawing the ever-changing American extent. Through the analysis of drawings made before, during, and after the travesias were undertaken between 1965 and 1985, this article outlines how the geo-poetic vision and mapping practices—that embodies iterative freehand drawings combining different temporality, spatiality, and situated experiences—have attempted to unveil the South American continent as a palimpsest: an open extent to trace the ever-changing footprints that reshape its content. To conclude, the article assesses the contribution of situated geo-poetic mapping as a critical design practice to study and visualize the ever-changing, multi-layered, and multi scalar-realities on virtually unknown territories of contemporary urbanization."

What are the channels through which extractive activity affects the economy? | KEYWORDS: Chile; Input-output; Linkages; Mining; N56; O54; R11; R15 | ABSTRACT: Changes in the extractive industry since the 1990s have been considered an opportunity to increase mining linkages due to the growth of outsourcing and the formation of a more complex organization of the supply chain. Using information from the Chilean input-output tables compiled by the OECD, we analyze whether or not the expected increase in mining linkages has taken place between 1995 and 2011. Furthermore, we extend the study of linkages using a Structural Path Analysis to understand how the effect of mining linkages is either transmitted to other economic activities or has a limited impact on the rest of the Chilean economy. Results show a significant reduction of mining linkages in Chile especially during the period of higher prices. At the same time, the way the influence of mining activity is transmitted to the rest of the economy through sectoral interactions is limited and lacks complexity."

It seeks to explore how these components are presented in the Chilean context of gifted education, while examining the current state of gifted education in the country. The methodology was a qualitative document analysis that included an active search for existing documents on gifted education and document analysis in the field of giftedness in Chile. The country owes a debt to the education of these students and urgently requires a broad vision of inclusion that truly addresses diversity and a legislation that makes them visible and establishes a framework to regulate their educational care. The findings of the study will contribute to a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities in gifted education in Chile and provide insights into how learning resources can be effectively utilized in this context."

Eleven teachers, who received the highest number of nominations, were invited to an interview and an observation of their teaching. The emerged theoretical construct was identified as “Opening new possibilities: Inspiring teachers of gifted and highly able students,” which is further explained through three main categories: Being a knowledgeable and passionate teacher, creating an academically safe learning environment, and teaching beyond and above the regular curriculum. In addition, the theoretical process was explained through three phases: Expanding knowledge and understanding, Fostering positive attitudes, and Encouraging students to take action. Contextual determinants were considered to analyze and report the findings: students’ developmental characteristics, school culture, curriculum, and gifted educational provisions. Findings are discussed in the light of existing literature, as well as study limitations and ideas for future research."

In this regard, the paradigm of environmental crisis is discussed, in which such behavior is a serious problem of society. From the authors, the problem would be closely linked to the productive and economic system that promotes the artificialization of the human being, creating false needs that through their consumption ensure the sustainability of the economic model. Critical reflection is proposed from education, towards a new understanding of human behavior whose ecological perspective drives new ecosystemic relations, fundamentally based on collaborative relationships."

However, the colloidal size of the formed scorodite particles is still a bottleneck, as it would hinder the easy separation of the precipitates in a full-scale application. Here, we studied the effect of GAC concentration on biological scorodite precipitation at thermoacidophilic conditions in batch experiments. Higher arsenic removal efficiency and precipitation of larger and more stable scorodite particles were found only in biotic tests and at low catalyst concentration of 4 g L-1. Furthermore, with 4 g L-1 GAC, the Fe and As predominantly precipitated in solution while with 20 g L-1 GAC the Fe and As predominantly precipitated on the GAC. For experiments with 4 and 20 g L-1 of GAC, the average particle size was 66 and 2.6 μm, respectively. This could be explained by the lower saturation level of the solution at the lower GAC level. This study shows for the first time that the oxidative catalytic capacity of GAC can be used to influence crystallization of scorodite."

The Questionnaire of Assessment Literacy (QALMBT-Modeling) was developed to investigate the range of in-service science teachers (ISTs)’ assessment practices in model-based teaching (MBT). The questionnaire was informed by an assessment literacy (AL) framework and rooted in studies on modelling in science education. This Likert-type scale questionnaire was administered to 386 middle and high school science teachers in Chile. Statistical analyses demonstrated strong reliability and structural validity of the scale and exploratory factor analysis revealed three key dimensions of AL in MBT (ALMBT): (1) assessment strategies to elicit, evaluate, and support student modelling; (2) facilitation of student-led evaluation and refinement of models through peer and self-assessment, (3) and communication of assessment criteria for student models. Analysis of item-level data showed that while teachers frequently provide feedback and evaluate students’ conceptual understanding of models, they less often involve students in peer/self-assessment or use student-generated criteria to assess models which are practices critical to epistemic growth in MBT. This work supports future efforts to refine assessment practices and promote reflective, model-rich science instruction, particularly during the evaluation and modification phases of the instructional cycle."

The intervention consisted of teaching pre-service teachers about active learning strategies which they then used to design and conduct physics classes to their classmates. In order to measure the impact of the intervention on the level of disciplinary knowledge of future teachers, the Force Conceptual Inventory (FCI) was employed in pre and post instruction modality. The results show a normalized gain of 0.40 at the end of the intervention, suggesting that future physics teachers improved their level of conceptual understanding of disciplinary content after having learned and applied active learning strategies to teach peers. Implications for teacher training and study limitations are discussed by the authors."

The Questionnaire of Attitudes towards Violence (CAHV) is one of the most widely used assessment instruments in this context. The main objective of the present study was to validate the scores of the questionnaire (CAHV) in a sample of Peruvian adolescents. The sample consisted of 643 elementary school students from Metropolitan Lima, Peru (M = 12,8; SD = 1,32, range 11-16, 54,9% male) obtained by non-probabilistic sampling. The internal and factorial structure was analyzed, as well as the invariance according to sex. Finally, a unidimensional model was obtained for each of the 4 scales, with 5 items each. Adequate fit indices and adequate internal consistency values were obtained (α =,748-,782). The results obtained indicate that the CAHV is a useful, reliable, and valid instrument, with adequate psychometric properties to assess attitudes towards violence in Peruvian adolescents in school."

The emphasis was directed to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) degrees and with the intention of knowing their specific distribution by areas of knowledge. The most relevant results show the existence of a preference for engineering degrees and where natural sciences did not merit significant preferences. In this scenario, it was found that men showed more interest in engineering compared to women. However, there was no difference in preference for natural science degrees between males and females. In addition, parochial school students are more likely to prefer natural science degrees over other degrees. These findings are discussed from an epistemological perspective based on critical realism, which proposes -among other aspects- the transcendental relevance of natural sciences and mathematics for the sustained, relevant and harmonious development of engineering."

Whereas peer relations have been studied extensively in the school context, far less research has examined peer processes that occur within extracurricular and out-of-school time activities. This study used focus groups to explore the role of peer processes in shaping developmental processes and outcomes across four distinct types of out-of-school activities in Santiago, Chile. Across all extracurricular activities, three common features were identified: voluntary participation, symmetrical relationships, and a sense of belonging that establishes clear boundaries bewtween ingroup and outgroup. These themes were integrated into an overall model of peer processes that illustrates how voluntary participation and shared activity results in a peer collective identity based on shared interests. These peer processes resemble a developmental arc bridging collective and individual development, fostering socioemotional development, identity work, and positive relationships and trust within a set of symmetrical relationships. The results illustrate the ways in which peer processes may support development within out-of-school activities."

Friendships are especially important in this time period. The present study investigated friendship selection and influence (contagion) processes with regard to victimization, as well as prosocial and aggressive characteristics of victims’ friends. Using social network analyses (RSiena), we longitudinally analyzed data of five fourth-grade classrooms, including 185 students (56.8% girls; (Formula presented.) age at Time 1 = 10 years old). Results showed that early adolescents who experience peer victimization were not likely to select peers with similar levels of victimization as friends but selected prosocial peers as friends. Moreover, friends did not become more similar over time in their victimization levels. Prosocial students selected similar peers as friends. The discussion highlights the relevance of fostering positive peer relations for targeting victimization and discusses the defending role of friends in victimization situations."

Using data from stimulated recalls, interviews and observations with preservice teachers, interviews with teacher educators and schoolteachers and analysis of official documents and materials, the article explores the design of materials by a group of Chilean preservice teachers and identifies why one of the main rationales mediating their materials design is subordinating topics, the content-related themes guiding lessons, such as culture, historical characters and lifestyles, to discrete language. The preservice teachers' beliefs, their mentoring teachers and contradictions within the national curriculum emerged as pivotal factors reinforcing this phenomenon. Data also suggests that the ways in which teacher education standards are adopted by their teacher education programme could reinforce this subordination of topics, notwithstanding the standards' communicative orientation. The article stresses the need to provide more materials development instruction in teacher education, it highlights the need to re-evaluate how the standardisation of teacher education is adopted by teacher education institutions and shows that researching materials design can illuminate persisting issues in language education."

Bridging this gap, this study explores how a group of Chilean preservice teachers of English learn to design language teaching materials towards the end of their teacher education course. Drawing on the sociocultural framework of Activity Theory and using qualitative data from preservice teachers, teacher educators and mentoring teachers, it was possible to identify ‘Assuming Learner Limitations’ as one of the main rationales mediating the design of language teaching materials by the preservice teachers. The data also showed how this rationale emerged from the preservice teachers’ disparaging beliefs about their learners, and how its development was promoted by the school mentors at the schools where they were doing their practicum, despite the teacher education course efforts to prevent its emergence. The study highlights the importance of addressing materials evaluation, adaptation and design in initial teacher education, and the need for conducting more research into the intersection of teacher education and materials development to both expand our knowledge of teaching materials as well as understand how student-teachers relate to the tools of their future profession."

This study is based on a systematic review of the literature following the guidelines of the PRISMA statement. The scientific production related to the integration of immersive technologies in learning processes in primary education was examined. The Web of Science, Scopus and ERIC databases were searched, considering the period from 2018 to 2023. The sample consisted of 64 studies that met the established inclusion criteria. The results showed a higher production of studies in Asia, a lack of theoretical support for the integration of immersive technologies, and a greater focus on science education. In conclusion, it is highlighted that studies focus on the effect of immersive technologies on academic achievement without sufficiently addressing the cognitive and affective experience of students. The study presents a classification framework grounded in the stimulus-organism-response model, offering recommendations for future research and practical implications for educators, educational policy makers, and digital content designers."

The main predictive variables of teacher Pro-ARA are: ARA beliefs (CRE); teacher self-efficacy (AUT) and ARA knowledge (CNC). The objective was to analyze Pro-ARA in teachers who teach STEM and Social Sciences (CS) courses in Latin American countries. Method: A quantitative study with a cross-sectional predictive design was carried out applying four scales, where descriptive, correlational, comparative and structural analyses (SEM) were developed. 442 teachers from universities in Chile, Argentina, Cuba, Ecuador and Mexico participated. Results: The general structural model indicated that beliefs, self-efficacy and knowledge predict Pro-ARA; The structural model of the STEM area showed that knowledge and beliefs predict Pro-ARA, while for Social Sciences teachers, self-efficacy and knowledge are the predictor variables. Conclusions: It is suggested to generate training on Pro-ARA for STEM and CS teachers specific to the area that includes the variables that were shown to be predictors within the models, because teachers must first know the Pro-ARA to feel self-efficacious to be able to apply them to students."

Applying a qualitative approach and a phenomenographic design, ten second-year students from a university in southern Chile are interviewed. Data analysis is conducted in three stages: 1) information review, 2) coding, and 3) categorization. The results reveal that students are aware of their purposes. These are structured and comprise personal, familial, academic, and job-related areas. Seven types of academic purposes linked to academic progression are identified, which provide direction, happiness, motivation, assistance for overcoming obstacles, and contribute to a full-filling and satisfying academic life. To achieve academic purposes, two key dimensions are identified: academic objectives and academic goals. In conclusion, life and academic purposes are fundamental in youth as they provide meaning, motivation, and direction, acting as a self-regulating behavioral mechanism."

The objective of this work was to describe the profiles of well-being in university students of Psychology in order to evaluate the predictive capacity of the perception of autonomy in the dimensions of well-being in university students of Psychology. A descriptive, associative design of a predictive type was used, with the participation of 202 students (Women = 170; Men = 32; M age = 19.0; SD = 1.77). The instruments used were the PERMA-Profiler for the evaluation of well-being and the Self-Regulation of Learning questionnaire for the evaluation of the perception of autonomy. As a result, over 40% of the students reported, according to the PERMA-Profiler scale, experiencing a high frequency of positive emotions, commitment, positive relationships and purpose. Positive and significant correlations were identified between the dimensions of well-being and the perception of autonomy. The regression model showed that autonomy explains 11% of well-being, F(1,201) = 26.194, P<0.01. Higher levels of student autonomy would increase their well-being. In conclusion, the findings support the postulates of the Self-Determination Theory, arguing that satisfying fundamental psychological needs (autonomy, competence and relationships) leads to greater well-being."

However, despite its recognised value, the literature shows that it is still insufficiently rooted in schools and that students do not develop it automatically. The aim of this study was to validate an instrument for measuring self-regulation of learning in primary school students and to analyse differences in students’ self-regulation of learning processes by sex and grade. The method was developed from a positivist paradigm and a quantitative approach. The sample consisted of 514 students from third to eighth grade of primary school in Chile. The results showed that the instrument has an acceptable structure [χ2/df = 3.55, p <0.001; CFI = 0.974; TLI = 0.972; AGFI = 0.973; SRMR = 0.079; RMSEA = 0.071]. It consists of 56 items and 7 related factors, with Cronbach’s alpha values over .7 and AVE index over .5 in all cases, which is acceptable. Significant differences were detected in the self-regulation of study and learning and self-efficacy for disposition to study variables, where women displayed higher levels than men. Also, in the strategies for disposition to study and self-efficacy for disposition to study variables, at the seventh and fourth grade levels, with the latter having higher levels. The discussion presents the potential practical implications, possibilities for research directed at timely intervention, and the impact on the quality of school education. It is concluded that girls have better self-regulation than boys, that self-regulation levels are suboptimal, and that self-regulation does not increase during the primary school years without intentional training."

The methodology applies a quantitative approach with a non-experimental cross-sectional design and descriptive-correlational design of variables. The sample consists of 299 university professors from Chile (41.1%), Argentina (31.1%), and Cuba (27.8%), with 18.8 years on average of university teaching experience. The results show that the basic sciences teaching group declares self-efficacy, knowledge, and beliefs to a lesser extent than social sciences professors, but this does not influence the practices of promoting self-regulation of learning. In conclusion, the variables are related to each other and the ones with the greatest effect are beliefs and teaching experience, the latter independent of the professor’s country of origin."

Objective: To estimate the differences in the levels of engagement, motivation and academic satisfaction according to (a) intention to dropout and (b) students who remained with those who dropped out. Method: non-experimental designs were used. Two studies are reported, study 1 involved 3,256 students and study 2 involved 2,110 students. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale Student Test, the Academic Self-Regulation Scale and the Academic Satisfaction Scale were used. The intention to dropout was measured with 3 items and the final dropout data was taken from the official register of students who dropped out of university. Results: There are significant differences in the levels of engagement, autonomous motivation and satisfaction between the students who remained and those who dropped out of the university. Discussion: Students who dropped out in the 3rd semester presented lower levels of academic engagement, motivation and academic satisfaction than those who remained. The intention to dropout and lower levels of these cognitive-motivational variables may contribute to the identification of students at high risk of dropping out. These results contribute to unveiling key variables for the educational transformation of Higher Education in the 21st century."

A quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-application measures was used. A total of 36 secondary school teachers and 814 students participated. The program consisted of four months of workshop sessions and accompaniment in the classroom. It was found that changes in the teaching strategies mediated the effect of the intervention on students’ self-concept. In addition, the change in the students’ type of self-concept depended on the change in the teachers’ specific strategies. In conclusion, the training program designed for stimulating academic self-concept was effective in promoting strategies in teachers that increased student’s self-concept. Thus, it can be concluded that the intervention is an approachable methodology to support the development of self-concept, potentially impacting students’ academic success. The findings contribute to the design of future interventions in school contexts for the improvement of students’ self-concept."

For this purpose, a systematic literature review was conducted, articles published in the Web of Science, Scopus and SciELO databases were analyzed, between 2016 and 2021, achieving a final sample of 19 researches. The results showed that the European continent, specifically Spain, is where most interventions with video games are developed at this educational level. However, the samples used were not very representative. Also, it was shown that pedagogical strategies linked to the area of mathematics are mainly used to integrate technology into the classroom, leaving aside the promotion of the humanistic area in relation to this digital tool. Finally, all the interventions showed effectiveness; however, it is necessary to advance in this line of research, which is at an incipient level of development in schools, even more so considering the effectiveness they showed for educational purposes. In conclusion, interventions that include technologies in school contexts obtain positive results in the teachinglearning process, helping to develop both content and transversal skills in students."

Existing models that predict the intention to drop out require the incorporation of complex variables strongly related to student success, such as self-regulated learning. Moreover, new possible predictors have emerged in the context of a pandemic. This study set out to validate scales that measure the phases of self-regulation of learning in Chilean secondary school students and determine the association between self-regulation, forced labor insertion, technological barrier, and intention to quit during COVID-19. An instrumental design was carried out, where 251 students participated, and a cross-sectional predictive design with a sample of 171. Results showed adequate psychometric properties in assessment scales for self-regulation. Furthermore, the logistic regression model carried out to predict the dropout intention was significant. The final model showed that external causal attributions, planning self-evaluation, forced labor insertion, and technological barriers were significant predictors, achieving a success rate of 84.8%. In conclusion, although many factors are considered in dropout intention models, this study incorporated self-regulation skills that can be promoted in students and systematically integrated into school programs to help reduce dropout rates in secondary education, therefore contributing to a successful transition to higher education."

However, instruments to measure learning strategies are too general to evaluate dispositional strategies. The aim of this study was to design and analyze the psychometric properties of a learning disposition strategy instrument for university students, which was administered to a convenience sample of 630 Chilean university students. An explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis was carried out. The full scale and its four subscales showed adequate internal consistency (α < 0.70), a latent structure that fit the data and weak but statistically significant correlations with student-reported grades. It is concluded that the instrument is reliable and valid for use with higher education students."

A descriptive cross-sectional design was used. Two stages were considered. In the first stage, an ad-hoc survey was applied to 8,102 families. In the second stage, the DASS-21 instrument was applied to a sample of 59. The results of the first stage showed that 40% of the participant families had a member without paid work, an income of less than $ 440, and the majority did not have computer at home. The schoolchildren have felt anxiety, night fears, bad mood or aggressiveness, several of them have not completed schoolwork and reported motivational difficulties. Most of surveyed students have not dedicated enough time to schoolwork and their main activity has been to watch TV series. The second stage showed that the 57.6% of parents presented severe anxiety, 50.8% stress and 83% depression. It is concluded that families lack the resources for the effective development of online education. Specialized actions are required to ""mitigate"" the impact of physical isolation by Covid-19 on socio-academic and mental health variables in schoolchildren and their families."

A cross-sectional predictive design was used and 362 students of Higher Education from a region of southern central Chile participated.To respond to the objectives, a Model of Structural Equations was used, specifically the Probit model suitable for ordinal regressions.The results showed that: (1) self-efficacy for the practice of physical activity, lack of time, lack of will, lack of ability, self-concept of physical condition and physical self-concept of strength significantly predicted the level of practice of physical activity; (2) the level of physical activity mediates the relationship between sociocognitive variables and positive affectivity. It is possible to conclude that sociocognitive variables influence the levels of physical activity of university students and the latter influences their well-being."

A program of 12 sessions of 20 minutes was applied by professors teaching the subject Calculus I. An experimental design randomized by conglomerates with a control and an experimental group was used, with pre and post intervention measurements. The type of sampling was no-probabilistic in five engineering careers. Four sections with 117 students were assigned randomly to the experimental group and three sections with 97 students were assigned to the control group. Using mixed linear models, the results showed better indicators in the experimental group for the nine dependent variables in the study. It is concluded that the intervention is effective to enhance the disposition to study in engineering students."

Objective: To characterize the quantitative empirical research on self-regulated learning in health science students. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was carried out in the Web of Science (WOS), Scopus and SciELO databases from 2014 to 2019. We selected 29 out of 149 articles found. Results: Europe and Asia were the continents with the highest frequency of publications. The most significant findings were the non-experimental design, the use of motivational questionnaire, the learning strategies, and sample sizes of 51 to 100 and 501 to 1000. The medicine and nursing trainings were found to study self-regulated learning the most. The variables with the highest frequency were sociodemographic and those student-related. Problem-based learning in an intracurricular format was the most widely used methodology to develop it. The main limitations reported were related to the instrument and the sample. Conclusions: It is necessary to research in South America and to establish alliances with other countries in the region, in addition to overcoming methodological limitations. It is suggested to carry out quasi-experimental designs and investigate affective, social and cultural variables that could influence self-regulated learning. Active methodologies should be permanently included in the study plans as there is evidence of their effectiveness. All health sciences studies are invited to advance in this area."

A systematic review of the literature was performed by reviewing the databases: Web of Science, Scopus, Scielo and Eric, with the descriptors ""university students, self-control and academic performance"". A total of 173 articles were found, articles that show that the predictiveexplanatory research designs are the most used for the study of the relationship between self-control and academic performance. The work shows that there is a direct relationship between self-control and academic performance, observable when objective measures are used to study these variables."
1867,6,"TITLE: Neo-liberalized Housing Policy and Urban Accessibility: the relevance of perception in intermediate cities. The case of Temuco, Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Distance; Housing policy; Perception; Social housing; Urban accessibility | ABSTRACT: The neoliberal model of housing production has been installed in most Latin American countries. However, in most cases it has resulted in problems of urban accessibility. Understanding that accessibility is not only a problem of distance, but especially of the experience of mobility towards services, this article analyses the perception of urban accessibility that is configured in neighbourhoods built through housing policy in Temuco, an intermediate city in the south of Chile. Methodologically, a mixed approach was deployed, based on the application of an urban accessibility index, semi-structured interviews and go along interviews on the daily mobility of residents of the city’s housing neighbourhoods. The results show that the experience of mobility towards urban services is marked by a number of barriers related to socio-economic status and gender, which the residents do not face in identical ways. In addition, it is noted that urban investments and infrastructures built around neighbourhoods to improve their accessibility can be perceived as socially selective when they promote a specific type of mobility, to the detriment of others. We conclude by reflecting on the importance of the subjective dimension in the configuration of urban accessibility in intermediate and small cities, where this phenomenon is not usually problematised."

Mixtura social y sociabilidad: ¿inducen los Proyectos de Integración Social vínculos socioeconómicamente diversos? | KEYWORDS: housing policy; segregation; social integration | ABSTRACT: Social mixture has become an urban policy in Chile and Latin America. Although the corresponding initiatives seek to reduce the segregation of social classes, we still do not know whether, under the conditions of mixture and environment over which these neighbourhoods are built, it is possible (or not) to promote pluri-classist sociabilities. Using two social integration projects and a mixed methodology this article intends to fill this gap. The results suggest that due to the type of diversity promoted by these neighbourhoods, as well as because of their peripheral location in homogeneous environments, the sociabilities they produce are not diverse enough to work, for example, the so-called neighbourhood effect. The findings also reveal the importance of designing common spaces between resi-dents, spaces that have the capacity to minimize metropolitan habitus that the middle classes deploy. It concludes with suggestions to improve and expand the social mix approach in housing policies."
1869,6,"TITLE: Non-metropolitan cities in Latin American urban studies: Between trickle-down urban theory and singularisation theory | KEYWORDS: intermediate city; Latin America; metropolis; small city; urban studies | ABSTRACT: Non-metropolitan cities are subject to growing attention in Latin American urban studies. However, there is no research that critically analyses the territorial, epistemological and methodological approaches that have been adopted within this line of academic work. This article deals with this knowledge gap, arguing that specialised literature tends to approach non-metropolitan places as mini-metropolises that replicate urban phenomena observed in large cities on a lesser scale or as unique places that are unexplained by existing urban theory. We refer respectively to these two tendencies as trickle-down urban theory and singularisation theory, and examine their impact on Latin American urban studies in spatial, epistemological and methodological terms. The article ends by suggesting a research agenda based on comparative studies of cities of differing sizes as a way to generate a more integrative urban theory."

This article seeks to understand the way in which coexistence within mixed-income neighbourhoods is configured, focusing on two neighbourhoods of Social Integration in Chile. Based on semi-structured interviews, the results show the importance of class differences and the aspiration for social mobility in disputes between residents. Notwithstanding classism, coexistence in these places is stable due to a series of social and spatial mechanisms, including low sociability, a common definition of a good neighbour and internal socioeconomic distribution models which minimize differences. It concludes by analysing the fragility that coexistence of these strange communities acquires in crisis contexts."
1871,9,"TITLE: Lifestyle migration: Creating diverse and cohesive communities? the case of Los Riscos, Pucón, Chile Migración por estilo de vida: ¿creando comunidades diversas y cohesionadas? el caso de Los Riscos, Pucón, Chile | KEYWORDS: Community; Lifestyle migration; Rural gentrification; Segregation; Social distinction | ABSTRACT: Based on the study of a suburban sector of Pucón, this work seeks to analyze how lifestyle migration has impacted on the sociocultural segregation of a historically homogeneous community in socioeconomic terms. Through interviews and participant observation, the results show that migration has induced the gentrification of the area and also new forms of social distinction. However, the results also show that the sociocultural segregation is not a consequence per se of the socioeconomic diversity of the area, but rather of the different claims of authenticity and lifestyles that coexist in it. On this basis, it is argued that segregation is not a structural phenomenon but is rather anchored in the relationships between subjects and, therefore, open to transformations, especially when dealing with threatened suburban communities that value natural amenities and oppose the commodification of nature."
1872,6,"TITLE: Intermediate cities: Dynamics of intermediation from the notion of place. The case of the Araucanía region, Chile Ciudades intermedias: Dinámicas de intermediación desde la noción de lugar. El caso de la región de la Araucanía, Chile | KEYWORDS: Intermediate cities; Intermediation; Place; Urban sustainability | ABSTRACT: The following article contributes to the discussion of intermediate cities and their dynamics of intermediation. Although it is recognized the theoretical advancement generated in this field of research in the recent years, the article questions its tendency to homogenize the understanding of these types of cities. The article suggests that it is necessary to comprehend the intermediate cities from their constitutive social practices. From this perspective, the notion of place is introduced as a vital aspect to understand the process of intermediation and the particularity of each urban system. From some key constitutive aspects of the notion of place suggested by Massey (2012) the article empirically examines social practices and tensions that are part of the dynamics of intermediation in three case studies. It is argued that this conceptual approach contributes to the development of a more appropriate and relational understanding of intermediate cities and their respective dynamics of intermediation. The area of study is in the La Araucanía Region, specifically in the intermediate and intercultural cities of Villarrica, Angol and Victoria."

To reconstruct the history of the local urban development primary sources, press archives, regional management records and minutes written by the municipal councils were used. The results indicate that, at that time, the city experienced a strong population growth derived from rural-urban migration generated by the ISI model, which led to a number of drawbacks such as paving, traffic congestion, and lack of basic services and housing. We conclude that centralized institutional efforts offered slow solutions that did not fit completely the local conditions and intensified the effects of the problems as well as helped to destabilize the balance between the spheres of sustainability."
1874,20,"TITLE: Enhancing Dementia Classification for Diverse Demographic Groups: Using Vision Transformer-Based Continuous Scoring of Clock Drawing Tests | KEYWORDS: Cognitive function; Deep learning neural networks; Machine learning | ABSTRACT: Objectives Alzheimer's disease and related dementias significantly affect older adults' quality of life. The clock-drawing test (CDT) is a widely used dementia screening tool due to its ease of administration and effectiveness. However, manual CDT-coding in large-scale studies can be time-intensive and prone to coding errors and is typically limited to ordinal responses. In this study, we developed a continuous CDT score using a deep learning neural network (DLNN) and evaluated its ability to classify participants as having dementia or not. Methods Using a nationally representative sample of older adults from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), we trained deep learning models on CDT images to generate both ordinal and continuous scores. Using a modified NHATS dementia classification algorithm as a benchmark, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for each scoring approach. Thresholds were determined by balancing sensitivity and specificity, and demographic-specific thresholds were compared to a uniform threshold for classification accuracy. Results Continuous CDT scores provided more granular thresholds than ordinal scores for dementia classification, which vary by demographic characteristics. Lower thresholds were identified for Black individuals, those with lower education, and those ages 90 or older. Compared to ordinal scores, continuous scores also allowed for a more balanced sensitivity and specificity. Discussion This study demonstrates the potential of continuous CDT generated by DLNN to enhance dementia classification. By identifying demographic-specific thresholds, it offers a more inclusive and adaptive approach, which could lead to improved guidelines for using CDT in dementia screening."
1875,0,"TITLE: Response patterns in a multi-day diary survey: Implications for adaptive survey design | KEYWORDS: Adaptive survey designs; Latent class analysis; Multi-day diary surveys; Response patterns | ABSTRACT: In multi-day diary surveys, respondents make participation decisions every day. Some respondents remain committed throughout, whereas others drop out after the first few days or in the later days of the survey, leading to item nonresponse. Such item nonresponse at the day level can introduce nonresponse and underreporting error, reduce statistical power and bias survey estimates. Despite its critical influence on survey data quality, the important issue of day-level item nonresponse in diary surveys has received surprisingly little attention. This study evaluates different response patterns in a seven-day diary survey and considers how these patterns might inform adaptive designs for future diary surveys. We analyzed data from the U.S. National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS), a nationally rep-resentative survey designed to collect comprehensive data on household food purchases and acquisitions during one-week time periods. In total, there were 4,826 households with 14,317 individuals that responded to the survey. To evaluate how response patterns differed across respondents and across the diary period, we employed a latent class analysis (LCA), which enables the identification of different groups of respondents based on their reporting patterns. Our analysis identified six classes of respondents, ranging from “stayers” (individuals with a high probability of participation for all seven days) to those exhibiting minimal effort. To inform adaptive designs in future diary data collections, we evaluated respondent profiles for each derived class based on variables that were known before the diary portion of the survey. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) status and any evidence of refusing the screening interview were linked with classes having a higher probability of dropping out. Our findings have implications for future designs of multi-day diary surveys."
1876,13,"TITLE: A non-negative matrix factorization approach to update communities in temporal networks using node features | KEYWORDS: Community detection; Node attributes; Non-negative matrix factorization; Temporal networks | ABSTRACT: Community detection looks for groups of nodes in networks, mainly using network topological, link-based features, not taking into account features associated with each node. Clustering algorithms, on the other hand, look for groups of objects using features describing each object. Recently, link features and node attributes have been combined to improve community detection. Community detection methods can be designed to identify communities that are disjoint or overlapping, crisp or soft and static or dynamic. In this paper, we propose a dynamic community detection method for finding soft overlapping groups in temporal networks with node attributes. Our approach is based on a non-negative matrix factorization model that uses automatic relevance determination to detect the number of communities. Preliminary results on toy and artificial networks, are promising. To the extent of our knowledge, a dynamic approach that includes link and node information, for soft overlapping community detection, has not been proposed before."

Responses to the guiding question of what differences and similarities are discernible in the sociocultural adaptation processes that international university students experience in the university versus outside university in the receiving society. It presents a metasynthesis of 12 empirical studies that apply qualitative methodologies to the study of international university students' sociocultural adaptation, which were published in scientific journals indexed in Ebscohost, WOS and Scopus from January 2012 to March 2019. The metasynthesis results indicate that sociocultural adaption involves: (1) situations of shock that arise in the two environments of academic and daily life with specific challenges proper to each one, and (2) the deployment of varying intrapersonal and social resources in each context. Academic and daily life can be considered as necessarily linked to sociocultural adaptation given the compensatory function observed in relational dynamics of students as they move between the two settings. The emphasis of the research on presenting sociocultural adaptation as a primarily negative process, the theoretical implications of separating academic life from daily life, and the relevance of exploring the role of social networks in students' daily life are discussed."

A qualitative methodology was employed to conduct interviews with 12 young people from different rural backgrounds in the O’Higgins region of Chile. The results show that all students reported having high expectations of entering university. Students with the highest levels of rurality received greater support from their schools, but perceived lower quality in their education. In addition, geographic distance emerged as one of the main factors that hinder access to higher education."
1879,0,"TITLE: The Power of Diversity: Class, Networks and Attitudes Towards Inequality | KEYWORDS: ethical dispositions; habitus; political attitudes; social class; social networks | ABSTRACT: We examine how inter-class relationships shape attitudes towards inequality. Our theoretical frame defines attitudes towards inequality as ethical dispositions and hypothesises that class-based network diversity may favour the development of what has been termed a ‘reflexive habitus’ that likely pushes for more egalitarian dispositions. The focus of our enquiry is on Chile – one of the most unequal countries in the world. We use large-scale representative survey data collected in 2016 (N = 2927). Results of our regression analyses indicate that class diversity in social networks strongly increases awareness of inequality and more egalitarian preferences while reducing belief in meritocracy and the perception that the current distribution is fair. Additional analyses suggest that network diversity influences views on inequality to a similar degree among individuals from different social classes, except for meritocratic beliefs, where network diversity especially affects the upper class. We conclude by discussing the importance of reducing socio-economic segregation."
1880,1,"TITLE: strategies to promote dignified and feminist academia: some collaborative reflections from Chile | KEYWORDS: academia; Chile; feminism; gender studies; social sciences; women researchers | ABSTRACT: During the COVID-19 pandemic, scholars around the world warned about increasing gender inequalities within academia. In this context, we created Red Feminista de las Ciencias Sociales to support initiatives among women researchers in Chile. Our objective is to appeal for gender equality in academia and to promote structural changes that guarantee dignified feminist academia in the social sciences. This article draws on various self-training and discussion activities developed by the Red Feminista between mid-2021 and mid-2022 to discuss the role of women in academia, with implications for other marginalised groups in Chile and possibly other countries where inequality in academia is also a reality. Based on our discussions, we propose strategies to promote a decentralised, decolonised and feminist social science academia that guarantees gender equality as a fundamental human right and as a crosscutting axis in producing knowledge and access to it. We organise these strategies into four pillars: 1) equity and justice in the production of knowledge, 2) dignified work conditions in the production of knowledge, 3) a work environment free from harassment and 4) the democratisation of access to knowledge. Whilst these aspects have been studied in other countries, this article addresses the specific context of Chile. We argue that it is possible to reflect on feminisms (in plural) within academia and propose practical strategies for establishing new dynamics through collaborative work."

This study seeks to explore the disparities related to gender, socioeconomic level, rurality or urbanicity, and academic trajectory of 202,688 Chilean students who graduated from high school in 2016, to elucidate how these variables generate intersections that impact access to higher education. To carry out the analysis, an intersectionality approach was considered and an innovative quantitative model called the Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminant Accuracy (MAIHDA) model was applied, which allows for entering multiple variables to generate a complex analysis of their interactions. The results showed that a large amount of variance (20%) in math scores is explained by the aforementioned variables. These are socio-demographic variables, which ideally should not be indicative of one’s academic performance. It was also found that males, students of higher socioeconomic status, those from urban areas, and those with more favorable academic trajectories tend to have higher test scores. In addition, relevant interactions and mutual reinforcement between variables were identified. These results highlight the need to address the barriers and inequalities certain groups face in accessing higher education."
1882,0,"TITLE: Inclusion, equality and assimilationism in schools with socioeconomic diversity Inclusión, igualdad y asimilacionismo en escuelas con diversidad socioeconómica | KEYWORDS: habitus; inclusion; school segregation; social differences; student diversity | ABSTRACT: In this article we analyze the findings of a case study in two Chilean schools with exceptional levels of socioeconomic heterogeneity among their students, prior to the implementation of educational policies that seek to reduce segregation and increase social diversity in schools, as is the Inclusion Law. Guided by a discussion of the concepts of Pierre Bourdieu, the analysis of interviews with teachers, headteachers and deputy headteachers reveal an ambivalent attitude towards socioeconomic differences and mix in schools. On the one hand, these differences are valued and associated with benefits for all students, mainly the development of egalitarian dispositions, such as attitudes to relate respectfully and empathically with others. On the other hand, there is a concern about making socioeconomic differences invisible in daily life to promote social equality in the school space. We argue that this invisibility is articulated at the cost of assimilating the poorest students, which poses limitations for social inclusion in these schools despite their exceptional openness to social mix. We discuss some key elements to consider in promoting non-assimilationist school inclusion and democratic ‘convivencia’."
1883,0,"TITLE: Self-segregation strategies through school choice in Chile: A middle-class domain? | KEYWORDS: Bourdieu; Chile; school choice; segregation; social class | ABSTRACT: Sociological research has shown that marketized educational systems favour middle-class families’ self-segregation strategies through school choice and, consequently, the reproduction of their social advantage over poorer families. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of capitals, habitus and strategy, we analyse quantitative and ethnographic data on parents’ school choice from Chile to introduce nuances to this argument, evincing more extended and complex mechanisms of self-segregation in the Chilean marketized educational system. We found that not only middle-class parents but also parents from different socioeconomic groups displayed self-segregating school choice strategies. We also found that these strategies were performed both vertically (in relation to other social classes) and horizontally (in relation to other groups within the same social class). These findings unwrap a possible stronger effect of the Chilean school choice system over segregation."

As such, it has been a topic studied by many sociologists since the origins of the discipline. Today it is one of the most common subjects in sociology, in part because it has been recognised as a crucial environment for the (re)production of inequalities. This article explores the role of education in the (re)production of social inequalities and its potential to challenge such inequalities. In addition, the article presents some of the distinctions between research in the Global South and North, both in geographical and metaphorical terms. Since this article is the introduction to the special issue Education and the Production of Inequalities: Dialogues from the Global South and North, a synopsis of the published articles is presented at the end."

While implementing this policy, in 2019, the former minister of education directed a populist campaign aiming to change policy directions coined the Just Admission Project (JAP). Such policy debates have critical implications regarding the functioning of school choice in Chile. This paper analyzes the JAP as a case study of reactionary neoliberal populism. Framed by such conceptualization of populism, this paper develops a statistical analysis to model the potential influence of the JAP bill on school choice opportunities while comparing with the recently implemented new assignment system from the Inclusion Law (NSAS). We show the results of simulations representing how students would have been assigned to schools for the 2019 school year had the admission procedure been the JAP instead of the NSAS."
1886,0,"TITLE: To mix or not to mix? Exploring the dispositions to otherness in schools | KEYWORDS: democratic dispositions; habitus; school mix; school mixing; Social diversity | ABSTRACT: This paper discusses literature around school mix (the school’s social diversity) and school mixing (the interactions between students/parents from different backgrounds), and their possible relationship with the development of democratic dispositions. I draw on the current global context, which is moulded by a tension between national ideologies driven by democratic values and the challenges posed by increasing levels of social diversity. Studies addressing the possible effects of school mix argue that both democratic and exclusionary dispositions may emerge depending on the form heterogeneity takes, particularly depending on whether school mix is translated or not into school mixing. Based on Bourdieu’s concept of habitus or dispositions, the paper outlines an analytical framework to conceptualize the possibilities for democratic dispositions to emerge through the experience of social difference."

During the first year of this pandemic, 154 music teachers were consulted about their personal and professional situation in order to find out how they were dealing with the context of distance education. The data collected and contrasted with the bibliography consulted allow us to observe not only a modification and reinvention of their educational practices but also an important capacity for reinvention and self-motivation and an ability to move forward. These capacities are included in the concept of resilience. All of these observations lay the foundations for sensing a contextualized musical education with the ability to adapt to reality and the continuous changes that it presents and where the role of music education within the curriculum becomes in turn more important and significant, both for the student body as well as for the curriculum development of the educative system."

First, predominant educational models are described that, from a historical perspective, have determined the development of musical education in this context: ""Jesuit"" and ""conservatory"" educational models and an aesthetic-formalist paradigm. Next, the main characteristics of the praxial philosophical approach are exposed, and a theoretical perspective is constituted as an alternative to the identified predominance. This work concludes with a proposal of educational principles, which have been generated from a theoretical contrast between detected models and the praxial philosophical approach. This proposal seeks to contribute to future research as well as for pedagogical reflections, innovation processes in the curriculum as well as in didactics, methodologies, continuous teacher training, and the design and dissemination of educational resources."

The methodological design is based, on the one hand, on the analysis of the curricula elaborated by the Chilean Ministry of Education and, on the other hand, on a survey carried out on a sample of 113 sixth-grade teachers belonging to 13 of the 15 Chilean regions. In the results, teachers are categorized according to their position in the teaching of these types of music, the role of the State as educator and transmitter of culture in the school is described, and the data is revealed that demonstrates interest in working with traditional music in the classroom."

For this purpose, a descriptive statistical analysis and an inference analysis are carried out using microdata on income and poverty from the 2015, 2017, 2020 and 2022 CASEN survey. The main results show that the Chilean and migrant population were unequally affected, from a socioeconomic point of view, by the pandemic. More specifically, Venezuelans, Haitians and Peruvians had already experienced a decline in their socioeconomic conditions before the pandemic, but the situation worsened due to COVID-19 and the political measures implemented by the Chilean government to hinder their contagion."

The case of three groups residing in Chile is studied through a qualitative methodological design based on semi-structured interviews, examined by means of narrative analysis. Results show that those who adapt more easily and quickly to the place of destination tend to establish networks with weak ties. Conversely, those who have more difficulties in adapting to the place of destination, or do so only partially, tend to establish closed, tightly-knit cultural networks."

Techniques of dialogic inquiry have been used to analyze three groups of migrants (Colombians, Venezuelans, and Spaniards) residing in the Los Lagos Region. The sociological discourse analysis has been used to process the information. The emerging narratives showed four discourse types with respect to migration: forced, traditional labor, professional growth, and the search for professional fulfillment. It is shown that the economic dimension of migration loses relevance while the socio-political circumstances of the sending countries and personal projects and expectations of migrants gain heuristic value."

The main subjects treated are the way in which internal migration characteristics and regional economic growth are interlinked, changes in intra-regional migratory trends during the economic growth and crisis periods, and, finally, migration dynamics by age and their impact on Los Lagos’ municipalities. 1992, 2002 and 2012 housing and population census microdata are the databases used for the analysis. It should be taken into account that even though the latter census has not been officialy validated, it can nevertheless be used for statistical purposes."
1897,19,"TITLE: The two-sample two-stage least squares method to estimate the intergenerational earnings elasticity | KEYWORDS: Intergenerational mobility; Linked administrative data; Two-sample two-stage least squares | ABSTRACT: We show that the inconsistency of the Two-Sample Two-Stage Least Squares (TSTSLS) Intergenerational Earnings Elasticity (IGE) estimator is a two-way prediction problem involving the replication of (i) the variance of unobserved parental earnings, and (ii) the endogeneity of unobserved parental earnings in the equation of children’s earnings. Concretely, we show that the TSTSLS estimator asymptotically recovers the OLS IGE when the first-stage R2, i.e., the share of explained variance of parental earnings, equals the share of explained endogeneity of parental earnings in the child’s earnings equation. This condition leads to two notable outcomes with respect to previous findings in the literature: (i) perfect prediction of parental earnings is a specific instance of our condition, indicating that consistency can be attained even when parental earnings are predicted imperfectly and (ii) exogenous instruments alone are insufficient to guarantee asymptotic equivalence between TSTSLS and OLS IGE estimates. Furthermore, our condition suggests that strong first-stage instruments might amplify TSTSLS bias if they are also strongly endogenous in the child’s earnings equation. This last result provides a formal criterion for choosing first-stage predictors under the assumption that TSTSLS IGE estimates exhibit upward bias. Additionally, we theoretically study the biases of the two-sample stochastic multiple imputation and cell multiple imputation (MI) procedures, identifying conditions under which MI procedures outperform the traditional TSTSLS estimator. Finally, we validate our results through an empirical Monte Carlo exercise using administrative data from the Chilean formal private sector."
1898,7,"TITLE: Citizens’ Stability of Electoral Preferences in Chile Since the Social Upheaval | KEYWORDS: Chile; compulsory voting; direct democracy; ecological inference approach; party system institutionalisation | ABSTRACT: A strong oscillation of electoral preferences took place in Chile between the election of the members of the Constitutional Convention in May 2021 and the election of the members of the Constitutional Council in May 2023. This is surprising because, until the national-scale social uprising in 2019, there was a broad consensus that Chile was a highly institutionalised party system where political preferences tended to be stable. In this research note, we study how the electoral choices made by citizens shifted between both elections, using the ecological inference approach based on a Bayesian hierarchical model developed elsewhere. We find that a vast majority of the new voters that resulted from the compulsory voting policy implemented between both elections opted for centre-right to right-wing candidates. However, this evidence is insufficient to determine whether these new voters predominantly align with right-leaning ideologies or hold anti-systemic viewpoints."

We rely on a structural feature of the school system: A considerable number of students who complete primary school must change schools to start their secondary education. Cardinality matching was performed to account for confounding variables. Sensitivity analysis was performed to address the fact that differences in unobserved variables could bias our findings. Results show that attending a school that groups students by ability causes a reduction in the average scores obtained in 10th grade of 0.07 SD for reading and 0.08 SD for mathematics. Students matched by their observed covariates could differ in their odds of attending a school with or without ability grouping by 15% for mathematics and 10% for reading, without altering our conclusions. Disadvantaged students are the most affected, whereas best-performing students do not benefit from this policy either."
1900,19,"TITLE: Intergenerational earnings persistence and the provision of public goods: evidence from chile’s constitutional process | KEYWORDS: Intergenerational mobility; Proportional taxation; Publicly provided goods; Referendum; Social outbreak | ABSTRACT: This paper studies the relationship between intergenerational economic persistence and preferences for the provision of public goods. Specifically, we develop a simple theoretical model in which a public good is financed through proportional taxation, and that predicts a lower provision of public goods given an increase in the intergenerational earnings elasticity (IGE), which is widely recognized as a measure of the degree of economic persistence from one generation to the next in society. We test this model empirically using the results of the 2020 Chilean national plebiscite, which asked about the replacement of the standing constitution by a new one that would potentially expand the role of the state in the provision of public goods. Our estimates suggest the existence of a positive association between the IGE and the share of the vote against a new constitution, even after controlling for median income and income inequality. These findings are consistent with our model and suggest that sectors of society that exhibit higher degrees of economic persistence also show greater reluctance towards redistributive policies that increase public goods provision."
1901,14,"TITLE: Economic drivers of commodity volatility: The case of copper | KEYWORDS: Combination forecast; Copper price volatility; Macro-financial drivers; Uncertainty | ABSTRACT: This paper examines whether economic variables provide useful information with which to forecast monthly copper price volatility. Prior literature regarding equity markets has discussed this question extensively, but less is known about these variables’ predictive power in the context of commodity markets. We focus on copper, which is a non-renewable commodity that plays a significant role in several economies and markets. To shed new light on this topic, we employ a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach to account for both parameter and model uncertainty. Our empirical results show that several economic variables have significant forecasting power when compared against an autoregressive benchmark model, and that predictability varies across the business cycle."
1902,2,"TITLE: The impact of grade retention on juvenile crime | KEYWORDS: Grade retention; Juvenile crime; Regression discontinuity | ABSTRACT: This paper studies the causal effect of grade retention in primary school on juvenile crime in Chile. Implementing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that repeating an early grade in primary school decreases the probability of committing a crime as a juvenile by 14.5 percentage points. By estimating and simulating a dynamic model, we show that the RD result is mainly driven by two mechanisms related to the timing of grade retention. First, grade retention in early grades decreases the probability of grade retention in late primary school grades. Second, late grade retention in primary education has a positive and more relevant effect on crime than the direct effect in early grades. Our findings support the argument that, conditional on the decision to keep grade retention as an ongoing policy, the optimal implementation at the margin is to retain students in early grades in order to avoid retention in later ones."
1903,14,"TITLE: A random walk through the trees: Forecasting copper prices using decision learning methods | KEYWORDS: Copper price; Decision learning methods; Forecasting; Random walk; Tree-based methods | ABSTRACT: We investigate the accuracy of copper price forecasts produced by three decision learning methods. Prior evidence (Liu et al. Resources Policy, 2017) shows that a regression tree, a simple decision learning model, can be used to predict copper prices for both short-term and long-term horizons (several days and several years, respectively). We contribute to this literature by evaluating more sophisticated decision learning methods based on trees: random forests and gradient boosting regression trees. Our results indicate that random forests and gradient boosting regression trees significantly outperform regression trees at forecasting copper prices. Our analysis also reveals that a random walk process, recognized in the literature as one of the most useful models for forecasting copper prices, yields competitive out-of-sample forecasts as compared to these decision learning methods."

However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested in Latin America, the most unequal region in the world. We focus on Chile, one of the most stratified countries in Latin America. This study examines the relationship between social capital and four measures of status attainment, including job prestige and employment income. We use data from the first wave of the Longitudinal Social Study of Chile (ELSOC), a representative survey of the Chilean urban population aged 18–75 years. We analyse a subsample of 1,351 individuals who are currently employed. A Bayesian model of over-dispersion with relational data is used to estimate the size of the network, a novel measure of social capital. We analyse the data set using linear and logistic regression models and a complementary path analysis, first estimating models for the entire sample, and then splitting the sample into three groups to evaluate differences within individuals’ socioeconomic background. Results indicate that contacts’ occupational prestige has a positive association with job prestige and employment income, while the size of the network increases individuals’ salaries and labour participation. We also observe that social capital flows through stratified networks which tend to favour individuals from high socioeconomic backgrounds. We discuss the need to conduct more in-depth evaluations of how better creation of social capital and its effects on status attainment could be closely linked to positions of privilege and advantage accumulation processes in highly unequal contexts."

The estimator is based on finding, for each unit that needs to be matched, sets of observations such that a convex combination of them has the same covariate values as the unit needing matching or with minimized distance between them. We implement the proposed estimator with data from the National Supported Work Demonstration, finding outstanding performance in terms of covariate balance. Monte Carlo evidence shows that our estimator performs well in designs previously used in the literature."

Digital media editors have not been immune to the phenomenon, which is why there is growing interest, both professional and academic, regarding its possible uses. Objectives: In this paper we seek to detect the experiences, challenges and projections regarding the use of artificial intelligence in the generation of news content. In turn, the specific objectives aim both to offer a general overview of journalistic experiences with AI and to study the results of a survey regarding the use of this technology in the production of content in Ibero-America. Methodology: A survey was conducted among 154 participants through a cycle of webinars held at four universities in Ibero-America during the second semester of 2023, corresponding to 14 countries in the region, including academics, researchers and students of Journalism (and related degrees in Social Communication), along with managers and journalists from prominent media outlets. Results: although journalistic experiences with AI are still incipient in the region, the responses obtained show that most participants use generative AI tools every week, there is greater knowledge (and preference) for ChatGPT, and there is a consensus regarding how artificial intelligence can bring great benefits if it has the proper regulations."
1907,-1,"TITLE: TikTok and active audiences in processes for political and structural change. An exploratory study based on the Scottish referendum | KEYWORDS: active audiences; political change; referendum; Scotland; TikTok | ABSTRACT: Plebiscites, secession consultations, and referendums are electoral processes that are different from conventional voting. Conversations before these types of elections tend to focus on very different aspects than those generated during the election of an authority or public office, with a focus on the future impacts that each decision may have on a country, generally taking one side or the other. In the current media ecosystem, this conversation takes place largely on social platforms and networks, where users consume content and interact with it, becoming active prosumer audiences. The aim of this research is to determine what elements determine this type of discourse on TikTok –as a social network that is trending among digital communities–, what type of profiles promote them, and what narrative code is used. To this end, based on the case of the referendum planned in Scotland for 2023, an exploratory quantitative and qualitative study is proposed based on the publications discriminated by hashtags related to the topic through an analysis carried out in an application called PyCharm (Python) TikTok Research. The results suggest that on TikTok this type of content has a large reach, but it is not possible to determine precisely whether it has a specific effect or impact. However, the rate of user engagement and interaction with this content opens the possibility of eventually greater influence than on other platforms."

1910,0,"TITLE: Assessing the impact of online collaborative problem solving on a calculus class for first-year engineering students: A communities of practice lens | KEYWORDS: collaborative problem solving; communities of practice; first-year calculus; online learning; social network analysis | ABSTRACT: Background: We examine the efficacy of an online collaborative problem-solving (CPS) teaching approach in academic performance and student connections with other peers, among first-year engineering calculus students at a Latin American university. Our research uses communities of practice (CoP) to emphasize the social nature of learning and the importance of participation and interaction within a community. Methods: The work applies a quasi-experimental design and social network analysis (SNA). A total of 202 engineering students were instructed using CPS methodology (experimental group), while 380 students received traditional online teaching methods (control group) during one semester in the first calculus class for engineers. Results: Results show no significant difference in the grades obtained between the experimental and control groups. However, students exposed to CPS reported a statistically significant higher passing rate, as well as larger and more significant academic and social connections. Additionally, SNA results suggest that CPS facilitated stronger peer connections and promoted a more equitable distribution of participation among students, particularly women, compared to students taught under traditional online teaching methods. Conclusions: The study underscores the importance of fostering collaborative learning environments and highlights CPS as a strategy to enhance student performance and network formation. Findings suggest that CPS can improve academic outcomes and promote more equitable learning practices, potentially reducing dropout rates among women engineering students. These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to address systematic biases and enhance learning experiences in engineering education."
1911,0,"TITLE: Transitioning from industry to teaching in VET: profiles of VET teachers in Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Industry experience; Motivation to teach; Upper-secondary level; VET teachers | ABSTRACT: Purpose: Situated in the Chilean context, this study investigates how Vocational Education and Training (VET) teacher profiles, based on their perceptions of prior work experience in industry, relate to their current motivation and perception of teaching in VET. By doing so, the authors seek to provide valuable evidence to inform the development of policies to attract and maintain well-qualified teachers from industry in Chile and other countries facing similar changes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a descriptive cross-sectional design to collect data from 660 VET teachers using a two-scale instrument: Perception of Prior Occupation (PPO) and adapted FIT-Choice scales. By adopting a typological approach, the authors constructed profiles of VET teachers based on their perception of past industry experience. The authors then analyzed how these profiles vary regarding individual teacher characteristics, motivation and perception of teaching in VET. Findings: The authors found a significant degree of heterogeneity among VET teachers' prior industry experiences, leading them to identify three distinct VET teacher profiles: “High Perception of Prior Occupation,” “Learning and Teaching-Oriented” and “Low Perception of Prior Occupation.” Notably, the most distinguishing characteristics across these profiles were age, VET teaching area, holding a job outside of teaching and years of prior industry experience. Furthermore, the authors found that motivation and perceptions of teaching varied significantly across these VET teacher profiles. Originality/value: There needs to be more research on the factors that attract and retain industry workers as VET teachers in high schools. This study is among the first to address this topic in a non-European context."
1912,1,"TITLE: Gender gap in STEM pathways: the role of secondary curricula in a highly differentiated school system—the case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Gender differences; Higher education; STEM pipeline; Vocational education | ABSTRACT: Background: STEM fields are instrumental in increasing the technological and innovative capacity of the economy. As women are underrepresented in the STEM workforce, diverse strategies have been implemented to boost their preparedness and interest in these fields, including early exposure to academic and vocational STEM courses. Using the case of Chile’s highly differentiated school system, this paper examines the role of secondary curricula on students’ enrollment and persistence in STEM programs offered by vocational postsecondary institutions and universities. In doing so, we seek to identify whether exposure to STEM courses within the academic or vocational tracks translates into fewer gender differences in STEM higher education. Results: Our results reveal that upper-secondary tracks connected to STEM courses are positively associated with enrollment in STEM higher education and, to some degree, persistence. More specifically, exposure to STEM courses in the academic track is the most effective path to boost chances of enrolling in STEM university programs but has no connection to later persistence. In contrast, applied STEM courses within the vocational tracks perform better in the case of STEM programs in postsecondary vocational institutions both in enrollment and persistence. However, this STEM pipeline significantly amplifies gender gaps as males benefit more than women from early exposure to applied STEM courses. We also found that other indirect routes, such as enrolling in STEM university programs from the vocational track with applied STEM courses, boost female participation in these programs, helping reduce gender gaps. Conclusions: While secondary STEM courses attract more female students to STEM higher education, they alone are insufficient to achieve gender equality in STEM fields as gender gaps widen in the more effective routes. In highly differentiated school systems, policymakers and high school leaders should offer increased support to women interested in STEM studies and careers across all secondary tracks to boost female participation in STEM fields. At the same time, all high school students should be able to select both academic and applied STEM courses as a part of their non-mandatory curriculum."
1913,-1,"TITLE: Patterns and persistence of educational mismatch: A trajectory approach using chilean panel data | KEYWORDS: Educational mismatch; Overeducation; Persistence; Wage penalties; Work trajectories | ABSTRACT: The misalignment between workers’ educational levels and the educational level typically required for their occupations, namely educational mismatch, has become widespread. However, despite its potential costs, there is little evidence of this situation in developing countries. Using longitudinal and retrospective data of employment histories between 2009 and 2019, this paper conducts sequence analysis to construct a typology of educational mismatch trajectories among Chilean workers. We demonstrate that mismatch is a prevalent and persistent phenomenon. Once people enter the labor market, either as undereducated or overeducated workers, they tend to stay in such positions for extended periods of time. Moreover, we find significant wage penalties for workers in a mismatch situation. Results indicate that females and young, less-educated men are more prone to follow trajectories with longer periods of mismatch or unemployment. New avenues for research and the need for public policies looking at these phenomena are required to avoid people’s dissatisfaction due to a possible false promise that more education can improve their life standards."
1914,0,"TITLE: Social network analysis methods in educational policy research | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter describes the theories and analytic methods associated with Social Network Analysis (SNA), and considers the application of SNA in educational policy research. SNA is based upon an understanding that individuals in a social system are interdependent and that these underlying relationships shape opportunities and outcomes in ways that require distinct analytic techniques. In education, SNA remains an extremely powerful yet underutilized methodological approach. The chapter begins by providing detailed information regarding collecting and analyzing social network data. The chapter next discusses common theoretical lenses used in SNA studies; highlights SNA research in education and in education policy, especially around policy advocacy and policy implementation; and provides guidance to educational policy scholars as they consider ways to use SNA in their future work."

Also, higher education institutions are progressively incorporating the conceptualisation of sustainable development by greening campuses. Thus, given the construction sector relevance in climate change mitigation and the role universities have to play as models for society, the purpose of the present paper is twofold. First, the authors develop a baseline study to determine the extent to which green buildings’ features and certifications are being incorporated in public Chilean higher education institutions, as a first of its kind effort in the higher education sector in Chile. Second, the authors explore the opportunities that can support the advancement of campus greening through green buildings deployment on university campuses in Chile. This study follows a qualitative strategy approach in the form of a survey design based on the UI GreenMetric World University Ranking that was administered through an online questionnaire to representatives who hold the position of Sustainability or Infrastructure Heads in public universities, which are united in the Chilean State Universities Consortium. The main findings suggest a general maturation process of green building features´ incorporation on campuses at Chilean public higher education institutions in early or transitional stages. The leading indicators relate to open space, pedestrian paths, and efficient appliances, whereas the reported performance is lower with respect to sustainability budget, zero emission vehicles, and greenhouse gas emission reduction programmes. The opportunities identified for promoting the implementation of green buildings relate to three entrenched dimensions: research, promotion, and public policy."

At the same time, in this article we will show the different aspects that arise from the questioning of the notion of ""social network"", especially if we consider that the historical processes where these networks arise are conditioned by the institutional informality. We will demonstrate that this second notion is determinant to consider the existence of a network, because the informal passed in a tenuous way the limits of the current legality, allowing us to also reflect on a wide field in History, related to the topic of corruption. The case we study is that of a group of merchants that manages to have the greatest social and economic presence in the country, during the government of the Supreme Director Bernardo O'Higgins (1817-1823)."

Food recognition is a key task in nutrition monitoring applications especially of interest for older people suffering from malnutrition and unhealthy eating. In order to ease the problem of food intake monitoring, recent health apps involve Artificial Intelligence algorithms for food image analysis. Food recognition is a highly challenging task as the dishes could be composed of mixed types, it could have a lower inter-class variance and also the number of dishes to be recognized is quite higher. In this chapter, we present an in-depth analysis and insights into the development of a nutritional monitoring system that would act as a Key Performance Indicator for the older people food intake monitoring. This system is aimed at providing a convenient food logging environment that would assist older people and their relatives as well as geriatrists in monitoring and maintaining the healthy daily dietary nutritional needs."

In this article, I explore the interactions between health institutions, “psy” technologies, and afro-descendant women registered in the “Chile Crece Contigo” program and how these interactions impact women’s subjectivity and everyday lives. Developmental sciences, especially neurosciences, play a crucial role in the program by promoting comprehensive childhood development. I argue that the entanglements between attachment theory, neurosciences, and epigenetics gained authority for health practitioners and shaped migrants’ representations of motherhood and child-rearing anchored in neurobiology. Although health institutions have encouraged the adoption of “cultural competencies,” practitioners’ interventions have tended to promote a neurobiological understanding of attachment and early stimulation, neglecting moral and contextual aspects involved in migrants’ parenting practices. Interventions have delineated representations of “(ab)normal” motherhood and childhood, shaping moral ideals of children’s development and a migrant citizenship project for the future of Chile. I also argue that by placing concerns on the table about migrant children’s neurobiological development and social vulnerability, the program has shaped what some researchers call the “neuroscience of poverty.”"
1919,9,"TITLE: Structuralizing Culture: Multicultural Neoliberalism, Migration, and Mental Health in Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Intersectionality; Migration; Multicultural neoliberalism; Structure-based approach | ABSTRACT: The arrival of Afro-descendant migrants, mainly from Haiti and the Dominican Republic, has led to the emergence of new discourses on migration, multiculturalism, and mental health in health services in Chile since 2010. In this article, I explore how mental health institutions, experts, and practitioners have taken a cultural turn in working with migrant communities in this new multicultural scenario. Based on a multisited ethnography conducted over 14 months in a neighbourhood of northern Santiago, I focus on the Migrant Program—a primary health care initiative implemented since 2013. I argue that health practitioners have tended to redefine cultural approaches in structural terms focusing mainly on class aspects such poverty, social stratification, and socioeconomic inequalities. I affirm that this structural-based approach finds its historical roots in a political and ideological context that provided the conditions for the development of community psychiatry experiences during the 1960s and 1970s, as well as in multicultural and gender policies promoted by the state since the 1990s. This case reveals how health institutions and practitioners have recently engaged in debates on migration and intersectionality from a structural approach in Chile."

Specifically, I explore the interactions between health and social institutions, mental health practitioners, psy technologies, and Haitian migrants, highlighting migrants’ subjectivation processes and everyday life. I argue that Haitian migrants engage with heterogeneous subjectivation processes in their interactions with health and social institutions, challenging normative values of integration into Chilean society. These processes are marked not only by the presence of, or exposure to, psy interventions and mental health discourses but also by the degree of compatibility between a psychiatric and neurological language and Haitians’ ideals and moral frameworks."

The authors propose that a thick historical analysis has the capacity to broaden and diversify the discussion about the core concepts in global mental health (such as illness, suffering, care or culture), and to nuance our understanding of the field's development and impact in specific political and social contexts. The paper analyzes how a systematic historical approach is crucial for understanding colonial and post-colonial power relations embedded in the field of global mental health, and encourages researchers and practitioners to view history as a source of imagination, and of alternative ideas and initiatives in mental health that go beyond existing psychiatric frames of representations, and towards truly radical and egalitarian projects and relations. This exercise in alternative historical imagination does not need to interfere with nor disrupt the urgency of mental health practice today; on the contrary, it is meant to improve the effectiveness of interventions. It can provide practitioners with a new and enriched language to resolve long-standing clinical dilemmas (e.g. related to patient adherence or limited success of certain cultural adaptations), which could not be properly addressed previously"
1922,9,"TITLE: (De)colonization runs deep: Mental health professionals working with Haitian migrants and activist mental health user and ex-user groups in Chile La (de)colonización va por dentro: profesionales de salud mental en el trabajo con migrantes haitianos y agrupaciones de usuarios y exusuarios activistas de servicios de salud mental en Chile | KEYWORDS: activist service-user and ex user groups; Chile; decolonization; Haitian migration; psy-disciplines | ABSTRACT: We explore the epistemic, political, and ethical contradictions and conflicts that mental health practitioners embody in their work and interaction with Haitian migrants and activist service-user and ex-user groups in the public health system in Chile –marked by neoliberalization processes during the last thirty years. Based on two ethnographies, we argue that the work with both groups interrogates mental health practitioners regarding the scope of their disciplines and on a professional-individual level. Rather than passively reproducing discourses and practices of domination, practitioners embody contradictions and conflicts triggered by the incompatibility between psy-disciplines; the knowledge and practices anchored in Haitian-Creole medicine and Vodou; and the radical questioning of diagnoses and treatments developed by activist service-user and ex-user groups. Practitioners question and challenge the universalist conceptions of identity, the mind, suffering, and treatment. Rather than an intellectual exercise, we emphasize that a call for decolonization implies the politicization of professional practice in –or outside– the borders of psychiatry and mental health as a system of government."

First, we describe the ethnographic context of the research. Then, we show their forms of sociability, moral experiences and interactions between young people and the adolescent penal system's devices. Materials suggest that young people's experiences are closely linked to a series of local values, norms and expectations around representations about masculinity and adulthood. Thus, through their moral experiences, young people reveal how they engage with criminal practices, as well as identifying their points of friction and conflict with the LRPA strategies."

Crimen y castigo juvenil en la justicia penal chilena | KEYWORDS: Chile; Juvenile criminal justice system; Psy-knowledge; Subject in development; Subject of right | ABSTRACT: In Subjects of Law or Subject to Development? Crime and Juvenile Punishment in Chilean Criminal Justice System, we address the condition that, in Chile, the Adolescent Criminal Responsibility Law gives to the young offender. Based on disciplines such as psychology and neuroscience, this law characterizes the young person as a ""developing subject"" to support his/her special criminal treatment according to their ""vulnerable"", ""risky"" and ""transgressive"" nature. The statistical analysis shows that the law protects, in its differentiated juridical consideration, a reinforced government regime of the youth risk. This regime seeks to resolve the subjection to the law of young people through the extended and dominant idea of their subjection to development."
1925,2,"TITLE: Adhd and gender: Subjective experiences of children in Chile TDA-H y género: Experiencias subjetivas de niños y niñas en Chile | KEYWORDS: ADHD; Childhood; Gender; Subjective experience | ABSTRACT: Although research on ADHD has tended to ignore gender differentials, recent contributions produced mainly from epidemiology have revealed that this diagnostic category seems to be strongly related to gender. However, these contributions seem to limit their scope to the study of the symptoms as well as cognitive, affective and social functioning of children, leaving aside subjective aspects associated with the ADHD practices of diagnosis and treatment. Thus, this article aims to explore how the gender dimension crosses the subjective experience of children diagnosed with ADHD. Based on open interviews conducted with children between the ages of 7 and 13, we show general trends that articulate gender and characteristics associated with the ADHD diagnosis, while at the same time, with children’s experiences that dislocate such trends. The findings were grouped according to four emerging axes: (1) locations, (2) abilities, (3) approches, (4) interactions. Thus, we will show how the experience of boys and girls is multiple in relation to the diagnosis and it is not possible to be reduced to a gender binary perspective."
1926,1,"TITLE: Teacher Education, Diversity, and the Prevention of Hate Speech: Ethical and Political Foundations for Inclusive Citizenship | KEYWORDS: citizenship education; diversity; educational policy; gender equity; hate speech; inclusive education; social media; teacher education | ABSTRACT: This study explores hate speech in educational contexts, focusing on initial teacher training in Chile. It conceptualizes hate speech as a form of expression that promotes violence and exclusion, emphasizing the role of social media in its amplification. Drawing on the theories of Levinas, Arendt, and Žižek, the research highlights the importance of citizenship education in building inclusive and democratic educational environments. A quantitative, descriptive, and correlational design was employed, based on a survey conducted among history pedagogy students at Chilean universities. Using non-probabilistic sampling, the study applied statistical analyses, including Spearman’s correlation and Cronbach’s alpha (0.84), to ensure reliability. Key findings indicate that 51% of participants believe teacher training should explicitly address hate speech, while 70% expect the Ministry of Education to provide institutional support. A strong correlation (0.49) was found between social media usage and the spread of hate speech. Although students recognize the problem, significant resistance remains regarding the inclusion of hate speech and diversity-related content in teacher education programs. The results underscore the urgent need for public policies that integrate diversity, human rights, and critical digital literacy into teacher training, aiming to prevent discrimination and promote ethical and inclusive educational practices."
1927,1,"TITLE: The Problem of Hate Speech: Beliefs of Chilean Students About Hate Speech with an Emphasis on Gender Perspectives | KEYWORDS: gender; hate speech; history; human rights; teacher education | ABSTRACT: This study examines hate speech with a gender perspective in the educational field, focusing on the beliefs of Chilean History degree students regarding its prevalence in their academic programs. Using a quantitative methodology with a representative sample (n = 998) and robust statistical reliability (99% confidence, and 4% margin of error), the research highlights the intersection of hate speech and teacher training. The findings reveal an urgent need for reforms in teacher training curricula to address hate speech effectively. Participants report insufficient tools to confront these challenges, both during their studies and in their future professional practice, exposing a critical gap in preparing educators to promote inclusive learning environments. The study emphasizes incorporating social justice and human rights education as fundamental components of teacher training, advocating for their integration into curricula to foster equity and respect for diversity. By addressing the complexities of hate speech within educational contexts, this research provides practical implications for policy reform and program development. These findings contribute significantly to the literature, offering actionable insights for combating hate speech and advancing gender-sensitive education while establishing a foundation for future research and practical interventions."
1928,1,"TITLE: Democracy is at risk: beliefs of Chilean teachers about the transmission of hate speech in teacher education | KEYWORDS: citizenship; democracy; hate speech; teachers; training education | ABSTRACT: Conversations about hate speech are a complex issue. It is not a new problem; on the contrary, society has been confronted with hate speech against specific communities at different moments. The present study aims to investigate the beliefs of Chilean teachers working in teacher education and their relationship with hate speech that may have occurred in their practice. The methodology was quantitative. The participants were 200 teachers. The data collection instrument was a survey to determine teachers’ beliefs. The results showed that teachers expressed concern about the problem and stated that action must be taken to combat hate speech. At the same time, they argued that their colleagues perpetuate and reproduce hate speech in their practice, which is also a complex situation that needs to be addressed. Finally, there is also a controversy about the limits of freedom of expression."

Estudio de caso en escuelas chilenas | KEYWORDS: didactics; gender; hate speech; history; teacher education | ABSTRACT: Objective: address hate speech in society and, above all, its irruption in schools. This is a factor that challenges the teaching and learning processes of teachers, constituting their increase in a response to feminist movements and to diversity and dissidence. Methodology: it is a case study with 6 teachers from various Chilean schools, with semi-structured interviews aimed at investigating their conceptions, the origins of hate speech, possibilities and proposals of teachers to work counter-narratives of hate, effects of hate messages. hatred from gender perspectives in their teaching practices and work processes implemented with the students. Results: the origin of the phenomenon is located in families and in social networks, considering critical thinking and a flexible curriculum as the main tools to generate counter-narratives of hate in teachers Conclusions: we are witnessing a violent irruption that deepens in the inequalities of gender, a situation that is being normalized and that is of great concern to teachers who, faced with such problems, say they do not have the tools or the skills to work on it, except to continue with the official content."
1930,1,"TITLE: Transform hate speech in education from gender perspectives. Conceptions of Chilean teachers through a case study | KEYWORDS: gender; hate speech; inequality; initial teacher education; social studies education | ABSTRACT: The research presented is positioned under the issue of hate speech prevalent in society, particularly its emergence in schools. In recent years, we have witnessed the presence of a phenomenon that is not new; however, it poses challenges to the teaching and learning processes for educators. Specifically, feminist movements and those advocating for diversity and nonconformity have triggered a strong response filled with violent and discriminatory messages and actions. To obtain some answers to this challenge, a case study was conducted with 6 teachers from various schools in Chile. Semi-structured interviews were carried out to explore, from their perspectives, aspects such as the origins of hate speech, the possibilities and proposals that teachers have for creating counter-narratives against hate, the effects of hate messages from gender perspectives in their teaching practices, and finally, the processes carried out with students. Among the main conclusions, it can be mentioned that there is a violent disruption that deepens gender inequalities, a situation that is becoming normalized and is of great concern for educators. Teachers express that they lack the tools and competencies to address these problems, other than continuing with the treatment of official content."
1931,1,"TITLE: Hate Speech and the Gender Perspective: A Problem from the Teaching of Social Sciences in School | KEYWORDS: Gender perspective; hate speech; social networks; social sciences; teacher education | ABSTRACT: This study explores a socially relevant problem related to teachers' conceptions of hate speech from a gender perspective present in the discourse of teaching history and social science educational practices. The methodology was used within the paradigm with a case study design, as a generalization was not intended. The sample consisted of 80 professors of history and social sciences. A quantitative questionnaire was used to determine the conceptions of the participants. The main findings include the constraints placed by programs and curricula on the presence of hate speech, student interventions in classes, and strategies implemented by participating teachers to position counter-narratives to hate in their practice. The conclusions include the importance teachers place on analyzing the prevalence of hate speech in their practice, both by students and the media, and its impact on teaching. In addition, the results offer some educational insights and perspectives for positioning hate speech as a transformative social justice perspective."

The materials that will be used for this analysis are those produced in the period between 2009 and 2015. This is a period of ministerial continuity in terms of programs and study books. Now, this study investigates the programs' contents, facing the recurrence with which the terms 'America' and 'Latin America' are used. At the same time, this text wants to investigate which places those concepts occupy in the hierarchical organization of contents and perspectives presented. The methodology used was a documentary analysis that gathered data submitted to analysis under Critical Literature and its conceptions. Among the main results, we find that the content referring to Latin America is in a disadvantage in the curricular hierarchical organization compared to other stories focused on a Chilean national history that foster patriotic values and mestizo national identity, where other contents from universal history are primarily related to the processes of the powerful western countries from military and economic aspects. Therefore, among the main conclusions, it is worth highlighting the relevance of working with the official programs and with students but from a critical and dangerous perspective (Giroux, 1998),moreover, to promote teacher training that allows criticism and reform of official programs such as the provision of materials that include diversity."

It emphasizes the possibilities and limitations that are visualized when working from such perspectives. The methodology is a case study in the city of Santiago de Chile. A content analysis on the discourses was carried out, and the theoretical frameworks were reflected from the social studies education and post-structuralism from a gender perspective. The results raise different innovations and ruptures around the traditionality that exists in the teaching of history and social sciences in order to propose new spaces for the inclusion of diversity."
1934,1,"TITLE: Social invisibility and socio cultural construction of gender in historical narratives of chilean high school students | KEYWORDS: Gender; Historical narratives; History education; Secondary education | ABSTRACT: This research seeks to evaluate the degree of inclusion of the gender perspective and the promotion of education in and for equality in the historical narratives of students in Chilean Secondary Education (n = 105). The study focuses on the analysis of the discursive-narrative mechanisms employed by the students and, in particular, of their representations of gender relations. To this end, the place given to men and women in past and present societies is analysed in the narratives generated by the students (n = 780). A mixed methodology is applied, combining quantitative (descriptive and inferential) and qualitative analyses of the manifest content. The results obtained report the persistence of stereotypical, exclusionary and androcentric perspectives, evidenced in hegemonic gender attributions and in the maintenance of the sex/gender system. These data confirm the need to implement specific teacher training programmes aimed at the acquisition of critical competences and the effective inclusion of the gender perspective in history education."
1935,1,"TITLE: The Challenge of Women's Inclusion for Novel Teachers. Case Study in a Teacher Educator Public University | KEYWORDS: citizenship education; gender education; social thinking; teacher education; women history | ABSTRACT: The following article is about the conceptions that different novel teachers of history and social sciences have concerning the inclusion of women and their history during their teaching practices. The objectives followed were to interpret and understand the content of the discourse of the interviewees, in order to analyse the advantages and limitations that the participants recount about their initial teaching practices. The methodology used is qualitative, forming a focus group and interviewing the teachers. Amongst the main results, it stands out that the formation given has not included women and their history, confined in traditional perspectives with predominance of powerful men. The interviewees add that in their teaching practice they have not worked with women's narrative, however; they recognize how relevant it is to include and transform teaching practices based on the recognition of gender issues in today's world. From a history and social sciences teaching point of view, learning, and working with the relevance of actions and narratives of women would generate agency. Thus, students could feel empower themselves by identifying themselves with these new models; this with the objective of generating social change concerning gender equality."

In this line, the objectives of this research have been framed in the reflection on problems and obstacles that arise in teacher training, as well as on possibilities and advantages of including and working with women and their history. The research is a case study that had five participants. The participants were teachers of social science teaching who work in different establishments in Santiago, Chile. The instruments to collect information consisted of semi structured interviews, and the techniques to analyze it took into account the critical theory, poststructuralism, gender theories, and queer theory. Regarding the main findings, it is possible to point out that, for the teaching staff of didactics, there are multiple possibilities to include women and their history in teacher training, as well as in teaching practices. However, for this, spaces that favor the inclusion of women's problems should be promoted. The participating teachers recommended, as conclusions, that women and other groups that have been invisibilized, marginalized, and have suffered violence in different contexts should reflect on their own pedagogical practices to generate spaces and transformations in face of inequalities, prejudices, stereotypes, and the oppressive roles that women have been given for reasons of gender."

The goals of the study can be summarized into understanding the possibilities and the obstacles raised by the students to work with women and their history from critical and reflective perspectives. The methodology is a case study carried out through focus groups with different students from schools in Santiago, Chile. The methodological guidelines are framed in qualitative analysis and feminist research theories. Thus, the paper suggests analyzing the results from the point of view of critical theory and queer theory. Among the main results, we can say that students consider that women do have a history, but that it has been omitted and marginalized by the decisions and actions of the men in order to generate hierarchies where they keep the power in society. The students add that the absence and roles of women must be problematized from gender perspectives and from didactics in order to end social inequalities."

The work is based on the framework to study socio, economic and social rights as human rights developed by the current special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights to describe the steps undertaken by the Chilean State in terms of recognition, institutionalisation and accountability of the right to adequate housing. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors describe the different levels of legal recognition of the right and the lack of constitutional and legislative recognition in the different levels of the Chilean Legal System. Second, they analyse the Chilean Housing Policy and the institutionalisation of the different elements that compose the right to adequate housing, describing and critically reviewing the Chilean housing policy in the past 30 years. The final section analyses the accountability of such policy, taking into consideration the developments of international and regional mechanisms and the processes of accountability lead by civil society and tribunals. Findings: The paper concludes that a human rights perspective of the right to adequate housing with legal recognition could improve the accountability, the results and development of the Chilean housing policy. Originality/value: The importance of this paper is both empirical and theoretical. Empirically, this paper adds to the current understanding of housing policies in Chile, aiming to complete the narrative of housing laws at the national level. Theoretically, this paper uses for the first time a recognition, institutionalisation and accountability human rights approach to analyse the Chilean housing policies and its loopholes at the national level."

At the intersection between Media Studies and Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article examines portrayals of AI and related technologies in the Chilean news media. We curated a corpus of nearly 7000 AI-related news articles from 2008 to 2023 from four Chilean newspapers. We combined an LDA topic modelling with an analysis with dictionaries of the key actors and critical issues discussed around AI. The analysis shows the explosive growth of the media coverage of AI in recent years, as well as the diversity of topics associated with AI in Chile. We found a high prominence of topics related to industry and technology, a high visibility of international actors, mostly U.S. tech companies, and a low level of mentions of critical issues around AI. Moreover, we also discuss the low coverage of the State’s AI use, the emergent use of generative AI in tech journalism, and the prominence of topics such as the arts and humanities that appear as emerging spaces for the problematisation of AI in Chile."
1940,1,"TITLE: Temporal dynamics of post-feminist narratives: boundaries of empowerment in female-focused car ads (1967-2021) | KEYWORDS: car advertisements; gender studies; Latin America; media culture; post-feminism | ABSTRACT: This study critically examines post-feminism through a 50-year analysis of car advertising targeted at women in Chile. It explores feminism's evolving significance in media culture, aiming to establish a comparative framework to identify changes and consistencies in feminist-themed media discourses over different periods. Using a qualitative approach, we analyzed 74 ads from a women's magazine from 1967 to 2021. The results reveal changing gender role discourses, showing a nuanced interplay between progressive components and neo-conservative principles across historical periods. The evolution of female-focused advertising within post-feminist narratives depicts portrayals of women isolated or alongside family, highlighting individuality but implying limited representations of collective empowerment. The findings underscore the need to analyze media messages aimed at women in shifting temporal contexts. We argue that analytical frameworks must critically assess the progression, or lack thereof, in women's (misleading) emancipation amidst the transitions from commodity feminism to post-feminism and femvertising."

Protests erupted throughout the country, inspired by a widespread belief that the state and powerful institutional actors, such as the media, had undermined the dignity of much of the population. In this article, we explore how and the extent to which mainstream media, specifically television, has affected the dignity of the Chilean people and how participants in the social uprising defined the concept. Drawing on the hundreds of complaints filed with the National Television Council (CNTV) and using grounded theory, we argue that allegations against harm to people’s dignity caused by the media have become more prevalent in Chile. The reasons given by audience members include the violence of the broadcasts themselves, the stigmatization of certain people and groups, and a lack of journalistic ethics. Ultimately, this article analyzes a key concept for social uprisings and connects it to the ethical and political role of media systems and newsmaking in contemporary democracies."

In this article I argue that, to harmonise many of these issues, a better understanding must be reached of the relationship between users and infrastructure. To this end, I maintain that infrastructure studies, in combination with user analyses from Social Studies of Science, Technology and Society (STS), can significantly contribute to this task. In this way, from a genealogical perspective and through the analysis of archival documents from the Public Administration of Chile, I analyse the case of the colgados: a group of electrical energy users without a contractual relationship with the distribution companies, which emerged as a problem during the 1980s when the electrical infrastructure began to be privatised during the military dictatorship. Analysis of the case of the colgados shows that, despite evidence presented in studies commissioned to learn about the profile of this group of users, those in charge of the infrastructure at the time – businessmen, economists, and politicians – interpreted the results of these studies within the economic-rational framework with which public policies were designed as of that time in Chile. Thus, this case study serves as an example of the obduracy with which assumptions of economic-rationality are applied. Strikingly, despite the evident contradiction between user behaviour and the assumptions under which public policies operated, the illusion of economic-rationality as the most representative explanation of user behaviour continues to be the central focus of infrastructural relationships in the present, whose most common device is the electricity tariff."

Specifically, using a “thematic narrative analysis” and various archival sources from 1978 to the present, I examine transformations in the Chilean Teletón over time. The results are clustered into three ‘moments’ that I label sensitization, identification and action, which link a social problem with a specific way of feeling and acting. In this way, it demonstrates how the management of both individual and collective well-being is promoted through the neoliberal organization of society. Finally, the conclusions state that to this day the mediation and pedagogical role of television cannot be dismissed."

However, genealogy, as a form of knowledge, is used in different ways. Contemporary philosophers such as Bernard Williams and Edward Craig have addressed different genealogical perspectives, characterizing the qualities and possibilities offered by each and identifying two types: what they call real genealogies and imaginary or fictional genealogies. In this article I argue that such a classification is problematic, because the term genealogy substantially refers to something that cannot be imaginary or fictional. The genealogist's way of knowing is based on recollecting pieces of real history that will allow him or her to look at the subject matter from a new perspective; therefore, to speak of imaginary or fictional genealogies is contradictory."

Un estudio en salas chilenas | KEYWORDS: Early childhood educators; Early education; Math tasks; Mathematics; Mathematics Education; Preschool | ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION. Early math skills play an important role in the school performance of children, causing substantial differences in future learning gains. Specifically, the tasks proposed by preschool teachers have been shown to have had a differential impact on the development of children’s mathematical thinking. In this way, it is important to determine the type and extent of math tasks teachers employ, using a sample of preschoolers from Latin America, where these topics have been less studied. Consequently, this article explores the different math tasks proposed by early childhood educators in Chilean preschool classrooms. METHOD. We analyzed 31 videos of Chilean preschool classrooms to identify the mathematical tasks implemented and the time invested in each. RESULTS. The results show that, in the observed classrooms, the educators favored numerical content tasks, such as number recognition and number-quantity correspondence, instead of those tasks that required the understanding of math processes. DISCUSSION. The results show that the mathematical tasks that were present in the observed preschool Chilean classrooms focused on mechanical and procedural work, tasks that hinder – to a certain extent – the development of more complex mathematical thinking."

In the review of the literature produced in Chile regarding the document of Informed Consent, we observed a considerable number of written texts of various kinds, mainly from different specialities of the biomedical sciences, however, this genre has not been studied as part of the discourse specialized in the academic-professional field. The main goals of the study presented here is to identify the basic structure of the Informed Consent document and to evaluate the legibility of these texts. In this research, the structural aspects of a textual corpus composed of 176 documents of informed consent were analyzed, establishing that these documents have a level of readability and low comprehension, thus characterizing a problem of approach both from the point of view of linguistics as much as to Bioethics or Biolaw."

However, there is no evidence of their effectiveness in middle-income nations. In those studies, students’ growth mindset has traditionally been measured using surveys where students report the extent to which they believe intelligence is fixed or malleable, without linking intelligence with a more specific dimension, such as math or language. In addition, these measurements have been undertaken without distinctions being made between personal ability (“my” intelligence) and more general abilities (everyone’s intelligence). Therefore, by means of a randomized experiment, this study assesses the impact of a single-session online growth-mindset intervention in Chile on distinct measurements of the growth mindset of students (general, personal, and subject-specific), as well as their propensity to seek out challenges. Accordingly, a sample of 248 students was recruited from 9 and 11th grades in three secondary schools, all of whom were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. The intervention was found to increase their propensity to seek out challenges and to experience an increase in growth mindset scores in all tested dimensions. No evidence of the heterogeneity of results by gender or prior growth mindset was identified."

However, many countries have failed to incorporate the teaching of these skills within their schools. Our study therefore looks to portray teachers' understanding, strategies and obstacles in teaching these skills across Latin American classrooms. To do so, we analyzed the responses to an online survey from 1391 active teachers across 20 countries in the region. This revealed varying understandings of 21st century skills, with little common understanding. Most teachers failed to mention the skills included in the most popular framework (the 4 Cs); those who did reported using the same strategies, regardless of the skill being taught. These strategies included project-based learning, oracy activities, literacy strategies, and teamwork. We conclude that there is little or no common understanding around these skills, nor the best strategies for developing them. Our study helps understand the potential causes preventing the teaching of these skills in the classroom, a problem that extends beyond Latin America."

Most evidence is based on small- and medium-scale studies fromdeveloped countries, with results that cannot be generalized. We explore which areas of mathematics are the most important predictors of future performance by considering the sociodemographic and academic factors of Chile. Scores from a standardized test for eighth-grade mathematics and fourth-grade language arts were analysed for a sample of 158,818 students, together with data on different areas of fourth-grade mathematics. The results reveal that the association of future performance in mathematics with number skills is as strong as the association of future performance in mathematics with attending an elite private school, in comparison to attending a state-subsidized school. Literacy skills also proved to be an important predictor of future performance in mathematics."

However, it is often difficult to keep parents involved, particularly when they lack the time or academic knowledge. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact on achievement in mathematics among adolescent children when involving parents from low-income communities in the learning process. This involvement is achieved through activities that do not include any formal curricular content. A randomly selected group of parents was nudged, via text message (SMS), to complete short and simple weekly activities with their children. The teacher then connected these activities to the curricular content in class. The results reveal that, on average, the intervention increased the students’ math grade point average (GPA) by 0.488 standard deviations (p <.05) more than students whose parents only received administrative text messages. This effect remains over time, extending into the following school year. These findings highlight the power of behavioral nudges that encourage positive parent–student exchanges."

Equated scores are obtained estimating the equating transformation function, which maps the scores on the scale of one test form into their equivalents on the scale of other one. All the statistical models that have been proposed for estimating this function are based on continuous approximations of the score distributions, leading to equated scores lying on a continuous scale even though score scales are usually subsets of the integer numbers (e.g., the total number of correct answers). In this article, we develop a new equating method from which equated scores defined on the original discrete scale are obtained. Considering scores as ordinal random variables, we propose a continuous latent variable formulation to perform an equipercentile-like equating based on a Bayesian nonparametric model for score distributions. The proposed model is applied to simulated and real data collected under an equivalent group design. Some methods to assess the performance of our model are also discussed. Compared with discrete versions of equated scored obtained from traditional equating methods, the results show that the proposed method has better performance."

Adopting a qualitative paradigm, of an exploratory and descriptive nature, with a phenomenological approach, information is collected through a group interview with 54 teachers from two municipal dependency educational establishments. Two categories emerge from the analysis, the first referring to problems related to the general educational context, and the second related to the processes of teaching and learning. The impact that virtual education has caused in boys and girls from the affective, interactional and educational perspectives is relieved, considering the experiences of the main protagonists who have experienced the destructuring of the educational system in the context of a health emergency, around the factors that hinder children’s learning and development, to provide relevant tools in complex contexts."

The research was conducted under a qualitative approach, using a design based on emotional episodes. Eleven special education teachers from different public schools with school integration programs in the Aconcagua Valley, Chile, participated in the study. The data were constructed using a semi-structured interview. Qualitative content analysis was performed. The results show different contextual factors that influenced the emergence of emotions, from those related to the pandemic to those related to individual characteristics. On the other hand, the interpretations that were at the basis of the emotions experienced pointed to a perception of contempt, inferior position in the relationship, paralyzation and demotivation. Finally, the teachers adopted different strategies to communicate or try not to communicate what they felt, sometimes resorting to technological resources. The results are analyzed in terms of the opportunity offered by emotions to move towards inclusive education and the need to enhance emotional training in special education teachers."

Given the above, this research aims to identify needs of an emotional nature related to the class work of teachers in the context of a pandemic. METHOD: A qualitative analysis of a open group interview with 54 teachers from two primary educational centers in Valparaíso and Ñuble, in Chile, was carried out. RESULTS: The indicated emotions give rise to needs of an emotional nature that correspond to: acquisition of tools for tolerance to frustration and emotional regulation, learning of strategies for managing anxiety and stress, as well as the requirement to reinforce a positive outlook and optimism. DISCUSSION: The difficulties caused by telematic work and the compatibility of roles and tasks that correspond to teachers as members of a school community and their family group, preferably derive from unpleasant experiences associated with emotions such as frustration, anxiety, stress, sadness and sorrow, which lead to the recognition of needs that guide the design of support proposals for the members of the educational communities, from a situated perspective and adjusted to their requirements."

Reflexión sobre las investigaciones en emociones de profesores | KEYWORDS: emotion; experienced body and knowledge; phenomenology; teachers | ABSTRACT: This article critically analyzes the literature on teachers’ emotions to discuss the concept of emotion and examine the disconnection between the research in this field and the progress that has been made on emotions in the broader context of psychological sciences. To achieve this objective the review consisted of two parts: the literature on the teachers’ emotions and the literature on emotions in the broader context of the psychological sciences. Delving into the main elements of the constructed emotion theory; some contributions from the philosophy of mind and humanistic psychotherapy were also examined. Subsequently, both antecedents were compared. As a result, the presence of a “representational bias” in this area is concluded and the relevance of incorporating the properly phenomenological and bodily aspects of the teachers’ emotions into this research work is reflected."

The increasing transnationalism embodied through athletes who compete for national teams other than those of their country of birth invites for deeper analysis in this sense. This context has become a space to discuss the conceptions of nationality and citizenship as well as the classic understandings of identity construction (ethnic or civic models; ius sanguinis; ius solis, etc.). Thus, it opens the door for developing scenarios where the symbiosis between sport and International Relations can keep feeding each other. In this regard, the following chapter aims to shed light on the rationale behind this transnational mobility of athletes and how it invites a wider approach to sports diplomacy. Firstly, it summarizes the main points of the legal and ruling frameworks, concerning the nationality of the participants in international sports events, by the major sporting governing bodies, namely the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). It continues with an overview of such mobility and the main justifications behind it. It ends with further reflections on how this flow of athletes becomes a new scenario where states, through their corresponding National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and International Federations (IFs), may display power and appeal."

This work aims to determine the degree of ideological congruence in Latin America from an integral perspective: citizens, legislators, and government programs, by implementing a multilevel strategy that places political parties as the unit of analysis. The results provide a holistic and descriptive observation of the ideological reality of the region, highlighting the variety of ties and ideological trajectories of Latin American party systems, which demonstrate low levels of congruence during the last decade."

Moreover, two populist parties coexist in the Spanish party system, making the debate around populism in Spain a complex and multifaceted issue. This chapter argues that, although ideology shapes the populist parties’ main political positions related to the health crisis, it is the government-opposition dynamics that most influence the political stance and discursive elements used by Spanish populist parties during this time. However, neither Podemos nor Vox have managed to take advantage of the health crisis, and both Spanish populist parties have failed to polarize public debate around the COVID-19 pandemic in their favor."

La coherencia ideológico-programática de los partidos políticos en chile y méxico: ¿En qué medida y por qué las ubicaciones de los parlamentarios coinciden con el contenido de los programas electorales? | KEYWORDS: Electoral program; Ideological-programmatic coherence index; Ideology; Party coherence | ABSTRACT: This research develops a method for the study of the ideological-programmatic coherence of political parties. It designs tools for the spatial analysis of the distance between the formal ideology of a party—as determined by the content of its electoral platform—and the ideological positions that its legislative representatives attribute to their own party organization. To do this, we analyze political parties in Chile and Mexico, with the purpose of determining the differences between parties and coalitions in different systems. The research concludes that coalitions and parties located on the right of the political spectrum are less coherent than those located on the left—a feature that is most evident in the context of coalition governments."

Given the proliferation of mathematical graphs related to the pandemic in the media, we proposed to analyse the variational practices in use in the interpretation of graphs of exponential behaviour that a Chilean newscast of high rating used to inform the population about the pandemic in Chile. For this purpose, a thematic analysis intertwined with documentary analysis techniques was carried out, in order to describe the types of graphs shown in the newscast, and a variational reference system was studied to analyse the use of variational practices. To obtain our results, the types of graphs most frequently shown in the newscast at the beginning of the pandemic were identified and the use of the variational practices of comparison, seriation and prediction in such graphs was analysed. In conclusion, the need is discussed for the conceptual evolution of the exponential function to be accompanied by a pragmatic evolution in school that favours the use and development of variational practices in the student body."

The proposed model allows to contrast the different thinking styles (TSs) found with the ones preferred by students in different levels of formation independently. With this purpose in mind, by using a quantitative methodology, 88% of male students in the program completed the questionnaires to determine these preferences, enabling us to perform a correspondence analysis through Fisher’s exact test. The RCGP results show evident preference for the legislative, executive, hierarchical, and external styles of thinking and clear differences between the preferences of students and of the RCGP. Finally, we discuss about various ways to create new means to strengthen and upgrade both the program’s graduate profile and the RCGP with the purpose of benefitting the formation of Computer Engineers and the future of the RCGP model."

Built upon prior studies, our map elaborates on the central and southern sectors of Isla Grande de Chiloé and neighboring islands. Through a combination of remote sensing techniques and exhaustive fieldwork, we identified a suite of ice-marginal, subglacial, and glaciofluvial features created by the Golfo Corcovado ice lobe during four maxima within the last glacial cycle, in none of which the ice-front reached the Pacific coast of Isla Grande de Chiloé. Our mapping builds a foundation and provides insights for future interdisciplinary research on the Late Quaternary sequence of glacial and paleoclimatic events in this key sector of northwestern Patagonia."

This cirque-shaped landscape is one of the most popular spots for winter sports in the region. However, no snow avalanche activity assessment has been conducted to date. We have, therefore, produced a snow avalanche susceptibility map based on aerial and satellite imagery, newspaper reviews and field work, including avalanche features recognition and interviews with frequent backcountry users. We extracted the spatial distribution of necessary and enhancer factors for triggering slab, wet and loose snow avalanches from a digital elevation model. Finally, calculations to evaluate each snow avalanche type susceptibility were performed using a Geographical Information System. By combining our map collection, we concluded that most of the area in the Circo de Gredos is highly susceptible to snow avalanches, especially slab and wet snow types."
1965,4,"TITLE: Glacial geomorphology of the Strait of Magellan ice lobe, southernmost Patagonia, South America | KEYWORDS: Glacial geomorphology; last glacial maximum; Patagonia; Strait of Magellan; surface exposure dating | ABSTRACT: We present a geomorphic map of the landforms created by the Patagonian Ice Sheet during the local Last Glacial Maximum and perhaps prior glaciations in southernmost Patagonia. Building on prior work, the new mapping focuses in unprecedented detail on the right lateral and frontal landforms formed by the Strait of Magellan ice lobe. We produced the map using aerial orthophotography, Sentinel-2 and SPOT satellite imagery, ALOS PALSAR digital elevation model and fieldwork to ground-truth preliminary interpretations. We delineate at least five glacial events defined by a sequence of moraine drifts and associated glaciofluvial features. In contrast to previous studies, we propose the Magellan ice lobe extended ∼65 km farther, to the Primera Angostura peninsula, during the local Last Glacial Maximum. Our study provides a new context to establish a precise glacial chronology of the Magellan ice lobe during the last glacial cycle in the middle-high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere."

These glaciers occupied the Río Corcovado, Río Huemul and Lago Palena/General Vintter valleys, Chubut province, Argentina (43°S, 71°W). By combining remote sensing and field-mapping, we build on previous ice-sheet scale mapping and geological surveys to provide high-resolution spatial information on local ice-contact glaciogenic, glaciofluvial, glaciolacustrine, and subglacial landforms. Twenty-five landform types, many of which are newly mapped in the region, were digitized as georeferenced shapefiles over a 5300 km2 area. This map enables the identification of former ice-flow directions, relative ice-margin positions and glaciofluvial drainage pathways for each preserved Quaternary glaciation. It also elucidates the former areal extent, geolocation and spillways of glaciolacustrine bodies formed during the last deglaciation. The map delivers an essential framework on which to build robust glacier-scale geomorphological and geochronological reconstructions."
1967,4,"TITLE: Glacial geomorphology of the High Gredos Massif: Gredos and Pinar valleys (Iberian Central System, Spain) | KEYWORDS: glacial geomorphological mapping; Holocene; last glacial maximum; last glacial termination; Sierra de Gredos | ABSTRACT: We present a detailed geomorphological map of the landform assemblages originated by the two major paleoglaciers of the Sierra de Gredos mountain range in the Spanish Iberian Central System. Based on previous works, our map focused on the features formed by Gredos and Pinar paleoglaciers during the last glaciation and subsequent glacial events. Based on a remote sensing analysis and exhaustive field surveys, we identified with great accuracy the local distribution of glacial, periglacial, mass movement, structural, fluvial, and lacustrine features. We recognized three main glacial geomorphological formations representing: (i) the maximum glacial extension reached (peripheral deposits); (ii) the culmination of glacial conditions (principal moraines) and (iii) the local glacial withdrawal (internal deposits). Our map offers a renewed spatial framework on which to conduct higher-resolution glacial chronologies, especially of Late Glacial and Holocene glacial activity, providing key information for performing future paleoclimatic reconstructions of the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes."

Often, these scenarios fail to meaningfully engage and account for the workers’ experiences, whose agency in effectively shaping their working future is denied and obscured behind discourses of autonomy, entrepreneurship and individual responsibility. In the context of the increased use of gamification strategies by platforms to both monitor and incentivise couriers, this article examines the capacity of playful methods to act as effective forms of engagement and mobilisation amongst gig workers. A workshop with this aim was run online in April 2021, at the end of the third Covid lockdown in the UK, using a role-playing card game with food couriers in Manchester. It drew on ethnographic data to explore how to support empathy and solidarity amongst couriers, how to facilitate the creation of a shared pool of knowledge about the job and how to reconfigure other stakeholders’ roles to improve working conditions. We finally offer some ideas to take the game beyond the workshop space suggesting several pathways for the future: a face-to-face game using printed cards, an open-source version of the game and collaborating with trade unions to reach more couriers."

This work presents a curricular analytics approach using process mining techniques to study educational funding trajectories as processes. Specifically, the SCHOLARSHIP-LOAN-SELF-FUNDED model is designed to reveal educational funding trajectories and obtain aggregate information. Academic and tuition records of 2484 undergraduate students from a private Chilean university who started their programs with a government need- and merit-based tuition aid were analyzed. Students who lost their scholarships were more likely to drop out, whereas students who maintained this aid were more likely to graduate on time. Curricular progress per semester was slower after scholarships ended or after the students lost them and stayed. Financial aid was associated with students’ curricular progress and linked to their permanence and graduation time. Higher education institutions should consider the eligibility criteria and maintenance requirements of financial assistance when designing their curricula."

A sample of 1234 students was considered simulating the application process to enter higher education. Through a simulated application, participants were asked to both evaluate the education they received and make choices on the prospective training they would seek at university level. With this we aimed at gaining insight into disciplinary openness and flexibility. The results were organized into five groups obtained through cluster analysis. Among these, clusters associated to disciplinary flexibility overcome the classic binary decision/indecision understanding of career choice. Therefore, it is concluded that the problem of career choice may not be intrinsic to students and their decisional process, but rather to a limited offer of study programs. This highlights new challenges for curriculum planning in higher education."

Method: it is a quantitative study, with a non-experimental research design of correlational type. A total of 117 teachers from a university in southern Chile participated. They answered the instrument ActEval (by its acronym in Spanish), which has 31 items organized into four dimensions and three evaluation criteria: importance, competence and use. Data were analyzed according to descriptive indicators of variables, comparison (years of teaching experience and training of university teaching), relation between variables and teacher profiles identification. Results: they showed that teachers appreciate positively learning-oriented assessment practices, but they feel less competent to carry out and use them. No significant differences according to variables studied were found. Positive correlations between all criteria were found. Three profiles of university teachers were identified: flexible evaluator, stable evaluator and theoretical evaluator. Conclusions: this study allows to understand that while teachers value the learning-oriented assessment, there is a need to train them so they can develop competences that allow them to use this assessment approach."

This study aims to analyze the frequency of academic, entertainment, social and economic digital technologies uses in student teachers according to four variables: type of digital competence, sex, years in the student teacher program and failure of subjects. A total number of 615 student teachers from two Chilean universities answered a questionnaire that measures five digital competences (taken from DigComp) in every of four uses already mentioned. The results showed an inverse relationship between the complexity of competences and the frequency of their use. Women reported a higher academic use and a lower entertainment use than men. Moreover, students with one or two years in the program reported lower academic, social and economic uses. The observed inverse relationship between the complexity of the competences and the frequency of economic and entertainment uses was more robust among the students who had not failed any subjects. In conclusion, it may say that the results contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between purposes of use, their frequency of use and the development of digital competences."

The purpose of this research was to describe the levels of digital teaching competence in chilean pedagogic students, through an instrument of evaluation of theoretical knowledge of the TDC and analyzing differences in the variables sex, type of Initial Teaching Training (ITT) programme and participation in professional teaching practice. This differs from the application of self-improvement instruments. In this study, 239 teachers in training at seven Chilean universities took a theoretical test of TDC. The results showed significant differences in the dimension of “Didactic, curricular and methodological aspects,” tilted in favour of women. Likewise, the indicator for “Design teaching-learning activities that include the use of digital technology” revealed significant differences across the variables: gender (principally women) programme type (higher for primary school student teachers) and participation in a teaching practicum, with higher scores for those who had completed one. Finally, the indicator “Uses digital technologies to communicate and share knowledge” displayed significant differences when it came to the programme type variable (higher for secondary school student teachers). This study offers novel insight into the TDC measurement process, enabling identification of critical areas in ITT."

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of psychological, cultural and socio-structural factors in the level of digital immersion in adolescents from southern Chile. A non-probabilistic sample of 469 adolescents was collected from schools with different socioeconomic backgrounds. A multigroup analysis was performed using structural equations modelling. The results indicate that family income moderate digital immersion model. Furthermore, for low-income and middle-to-high-income students, the attitude towards the use of digital technologies was the most important factor to predict digital immersion, followed by motivation. However, the results indicate differences between groups by family income in the following model’s path: from navigation skills to social skills; motivation to satisfaction; self-transcendence value to social skills; and attitude towards the use of technology to motivation. This study provided an opportunity to move forward in the understanding of the relationship between Chilean adolescents and their technology use. These results indicate the existence of deep cultural changes in Chilean adolescents’ life, which are strongly marked by the profuse use of digital technologies. IMPACT SUMMARY a. Prior State of Knowledge: The use of digital technologies has been studied in different contexts, considering diverse population, but adolescents’ immersion in digital technologies has not been addressed in the Chilean context. This lack of knowledge might affect a deeper understanding of technology use. b. Novel Contributions: The current study addresses and proposes a new definition of adolescents’ digital immersion taking into consideration psychological, cultural and socio-structural factors, allowing a more integrated, and empirically based, approach to the phenomenon. c. Practical Implications: As the use of digital technologies occurs in a complex ecosystem, the findings reached in this study represent relevant data for policy makers, in order to define and promote digital immersion in Chilean adolescents, and other similar contexts."

Digital immersion was defined as the persistent, continuous and enthusiastic use of devices and digital media accompanied by the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously with feelings self-efficacy, reliance, dependence, and identification with technology. Content validity was analyzed through expert judgment (n = 8); then, evidence of the validity of the internal structure was obtained through Exploratory Factor Analysis (n = 347) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (n = 347). The final version of the Scale of Digital Immersion for Adolescents (EIDA) contained 30 items, grouped into five dimensions: Variety of Use; Intensity of Use; Multitasking: Involvement; and Dependence, explaining 89% of the variance presented in the data. The internal consistency of the scale was satisfactory (α =.951)."

It was also examined, if being an academic user is associated with sociodemographic, academics and self-directed learning variables. The analysis of the answers provided by 546 participants in the questionnaires revealed high level of access to equipment and digital resources. Meanwhile WhatsApp and Facebook concentrate a higher social use, YouTube is prioritized in recreational activities, and Google search engine in academic use. It was found a higher number of woman in the category academic users. Being an academic user of digital technologies, in both sexes, is linked with higher levels of self-directed learning. These results support the need to prepare more and better academic users, able to take the advantages that digital technologies offer, in order to get a better initial teacher education."

Providing a comprehensive historical revision of media (from the Greeks to the Internet), this book identifies several critical junctures at which the tension between visibility and invisibility has overlapped with conceptions of neutrality-a tension best incarnated in today's use of the word transparency. Then, it traces this term's evolving semantic constellation through a variety of intellectual discourses, exposing it as a key operator in the revaluation of ideals, sensibilities, and modalities of perception that lie at the core of our contemporary attention-based economy."

DUCTION; Letters to the editor; School climate; School violence; Subjective theories | ABSTRACT: Introduction: The return to face-to-face classes after the pandemic carried effects that triggered cases of School Violence (SV) in 2022. The newspaper was one of the media that addressed these cases and raised the issue to be discussed by its readers. In this media, letters to the editor are relevant as they show the readers’ opinions on a current event, particularly that of experts or influential people from civil society. This type of public discourse in the press deals with argumentative theorizing on the phenomena of school violence and school climate (SC), so that it can be studied from subjective theories (ST). Methodology: Qualitative methodology was followed, using grounded theory. The analysis included a process of open and axial coding in the 10 letters to the editor selected. The means chosen for the collection of the sample was the Chilean newspaper La Tercera. Results: Among the findings, there was a superordinate ST that establishes insufficient coping with SV in the post-pandemic period. In addition, it was found that most of the STs are action initiators to address SC and SV. Conclusions: The experts’ discourse presents theorizations about the accountability of adults and schools in the work done to address SV, and change on SC work. Students are portrayed as passive subjects, which could limit their moral development and participation in these contexts."

Based on focus groups with teachers from public, charter, and private schools in the Metropolitan Region of Chile, this study shows that teachers’ identities are results of their experiences, the audit culture context, and media discourses. However, in order to combat negative media discourse representations, teachers need to re-frame the conversation by becoming aware of media discourses and creating counternarratives to reposition themselves in society."

Estudio comparativo en Latinoamérica | KEYWORDS: Alfabetización mediática; competencia digital; competencia mediática; COVID-19; COVID-19; digital skills; docencia; educommunication; educomunicación; media competencies; Media literacy; teaching | ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America forced a transition from a face-to-face educational model to a distance model affected by emergencies, technological precariousness, and lack of planning. This has heightened the need for media literacy in the region. In this context, the changes that have occurred were analyzed in order to propose a critical agenda from the perspective of teachers. First, a desk research of official sources was carried out to learn about the strategies of the four countries under study: Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, and Peru. Secondly, eight focus groups were conducted with primary school teachers from public and private institutions to learn about their perception of their own and their students' media competencies, the impact of the pandemic on their practices and needs, and the emerging challenges in this crisis. The results shed light on the need for relevant ICT training from a media literacy perspective, and strategies to address connectivity gaps, lack of adequate environments and work overload. The specific results per country and the differences and demands of each context are discussed in this work as contributions to the development of a critical agenda in media education."

1988,11,"TITLE: A Brief History of Media Education in Chile | KEYWORDS: Active reception; Augusto pinochet; CENECA; Chile; Conscientization; Media education; Paulo freire | ABSTRACT: This chapter offers a historical review of media education in Chile, highlighting the main milestones occurring over the past 50 years. It provides an evaluation of the current status of media education in Chile. More significant to the growth of media education in Chile was the arrival of Paulo Freire in 1964, under whose influence Chilean media education began to take roots. Freire’s concept of conscientization suggests that the subject is socially constructed and can only be developed through critical consciousness. The 1970s in Chile are marked by the brutal repression of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, which only began to falter by the mid-1980s. Throughout the decade, education and communication studies were mainly carried out by the Center for Cultural and Artistic Inquiry and Expression (CENECA), where the notion of active reception was advanced, only later receiving international recognition."

It introduces the problem of media education in the information society and argues the need to assess the skills of citizens in this context. It approaches this need from three perspectives: the pedagogical challenge that implies the little knowledge of the media competence and its little institutional formalization; the political discourse that privileges educational technology over media education; and the methodological question, analyzed from recent assessments of media competence applied in Spain, Chile and Peru, limited to the self-perception. Finally, we propose the construction of an instrument involving two features: integrative in terms of content, and innovative in terms of methodology."
1990,0,"TITLE: Perceptions about media in teacher trainers of early childhood education in Chile Percepciones sobre los medios de comunicación de profesores universitarios de la educación infantil en Chile | KEYWORDS: Early childhood education; ICT; Media education; Perception; Teacher training; University education | ABSTRACT: Increasingly, technological advances have made smart televisions, computers, tablets or interactive whiteboards are part of the inventory of kindergartens. Despite some attempts to keep the kindergartens free from the presence of the media, the desire to take advantage of technological advances has made televisions, computers, tablets and electronic blackboards being part of the inventory of these schools. These acquisitions have not been accompanied by a media education that allows children to learn to live with the media from early childhood education. The present study has as objective to know what the perceptions about the means of communication are that professors of Chilean children's education have, which will allow us, in turn, to approximate to establish how media education is incorporated in teacher training of this educational level. To this end, a distance questionnaire was applied to professors from Chilean universities who taught courses in media relations in early childhood careers. The results show that professors who teach language and communication respond more to the apocalyptic tradition of the media, while those of ICT follow the apologist tradition."

As spending on technological infrastructure in the region increases exponentially for educational purposes, and with national curriculums beginning to implement media related skills, this book makes a timely contribution to new debates surrounding the significance of media literacy as a citizen’s right. Taking both a topical and country-based approach, authors from across Latin America present a comprehensive perspective of the region and address issues such as the political and social contexts in which media education is based, the current state of educational policies with respect to media, organizations and experiences that promote media education."
1992,11,"TITLE: The state of media education in Latin America | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter presents an overview of the state of media education in Latin America. It begins with a historical contextualisation and proceeds to analyse five dimensions: socio-political context, regulatory framework, social actors, teacher training and academic production. Media education has had a varied presence in national policies in this region and hasnot adequately responded to the citizen rights approach or the theoretical tradition of educomunicación. Latin American governments have made efforts to connect schools with technology, improve education quality and overcome access gaps. Moreover, teacher education and qualification programmes on the use of this media have been undertaken. However, the results are not positive, as technological action has taken precedence over pedagogic action. This chapter concludes with a research andaction agenda, stemming from the contributions of experts and of results from the national chapters included in this book."
1993,11,"TITLE: Media education in Chile. A digital leap that abandoned the study of media1 | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Progress in the field of media education in Chile has been delayed by the political-educational decision to take a digital leap in schools rather than promote the teaching of the mass media. This is partly because the media is seen only as a resource to learn other content. In accordance with this view, there is a relevant state agenda to learn about information and communication technologies but a rare academic agenda to be trained in media education. However, we find a growing amount of academic production on communication and education and an interesting number of organizations and projects that work on media education, especially in rural schools and in the formation of film and audiovisual audiences. These varieties of organizations added to the recent formation of a network of organizations linked to media education, which allows us to be optimistic about the future of the field."
1994,3,"TITLE: The impact of bus punctuality on users’ decisions and welfare | KEYWORDS: Public transport; punctuality; reliability; user equilibrium | ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a public transport users’ scheduling model that considers crowding inside vehicles, waiting time, and punctuality as a reliability measure. Commuters simultaneously make two choices: the preferred bus and the timing to arrive at the bus stop (on time or late). Public transport punctuality is the probability of being on time or late, generating a parameter of public transport reliability. We compute users’ equilibrium, social optimum, and first-best pricing and analytically devise a methodology to obtain the second-best pricing. Using numerical analysis, we show that (i) punctuality plays an essential role in the commuter strategy modifying according to its level, (ii) commuters’ strategy changes according to how reliable the system is, and (iii) second-best pricing is efficient only for limited cases."

In order to promote an online safe environment, different legislative initiatives around the world have begun to tackle online harms, requiring certain moderation duties from platforms. However, the concept of online harm is subjective, especially if we consider that it includes content that is not illegal but is considered harmful or damaging. In view of the above, this article aims to study the different behaviors that can be subsumed under the concept of legal but harmful content in light of the taxonomy of harms offered in the United Kingdom White Paper on Online Harm and then proposes a definition of online harm that serves as a basis for an organic and consistent regulation of the behaviors that must be mitigated and controlled in digital environments."

Pisco: ¿un eterno conflicto a propósito de su indicación geográfica o una oportunidad para la colaboración internacional? | KEYWORDS: Geographical Indication; Joint binational exploitation; Pisco | ABSTRACT: Pisco is a brandy produced from the distillation of wine, which is indissolubly linked to the history and national identity of Chile and Peru. The rivalry over the pisco’s geographical indication (GI) has a long history, mainly grounded on political claims rather than practical reasons. The article examines the historical background of the animosity, the arguments of each party to support their position and the impacts of the current international GI protection of the product (both from a financial and legal perspective). We conclude that a cross-border protection, allowing a joint binational exploitation of the spirit’s GI, is the best commercial strategy to increase the recognition and value of pisco in the international markets, which in turn, would benefit local economies and producers and notably encourage the cultural integration of both nations."

This study is part of a group of instruments that contribute to the national diagnosis for new requirements of law teaching career in Chile. The methodology was part of an ex post-facto transeccional causal-correlational study. The Lawson Test, adapted to the Chilean context, and multi-variable regression models were applied and designed to diagnose the LSR. The results showed the incidence in the LSR of the sex variable and pre-admission academic variables such scores in science and language in the Chilean university selection test (known as PSU). The results also showed alternative and inclusive access routes to teaching careers. It is concluded that level of scientific reasoning among first year students enrolled in teaching programs were primarily at transitional levels."

The present study is aimed at analyzing the types of obstacles identified by science teachers who participated in a Teacher Reflection Workshop (TRW) on the formulation and use of questions in their lessons. The workshop consisted of stage 1 (7 sessions), stage 2 (video recordings in school classrooms), and stage 3 (3 sessions). The discourses of 8 participating teachers in the areas of chemistry, biology, physics, and natural science at different educational institutions in the city of Santiago, Chile, were analyzed in this case study. The analysis was carried out by the professors participating in the workshop, based on the participants’ identification, initial attempts to address, and proposals to overcome, their obstacles. In the earlier stages of the process, the identified obstacles had procedural characteristics, but as the process advanced, they took on a more epistemological nature. One of the main differences between the initial and final identification of obstacles by the participating teachers is that the latter were more precise and critical, and the teachers increasingly demonstrated the ability to propose specific solutions to teaching problems. Engagement with the obstacles does not take place uniformly but depends on the types of obstacles that the teachers identify in their practice. Proposals for overcoming the obstacles require the teachers to have time for reflecting and validating their ideas in their practice."
2001,0,"TITLE: Teachers’ scaffolding science reading comprehension in low-income schools: how to improve achievement in science | KEYWORDS: cognitive scaffolding; Reading comprehension; science learning; verbal participation | ABSTRACT: Reading is a tool that promotes the learning of science across schooling. Scientific texts are conceptually and linguistically complex, especially for students from low-income contexts because they have neither the experience with the language nor the literacy skills to face the challenges of scientific knowledge. This study used a mix method approach to compare the cognitive scaffolding practiced by teachers during science reading activities in high- and low-performing schools. Three teachers and 141 fourth grade students from low socioeconomic background schools participated in 48 class sessions. Classes were video-recorded and transcribed. The data were analyzed using Sanchez’ Pedagogic Practice Analysis System. The results show that teachers from both types of schools continuously use reading as a tool for learning. The effective teacher uses reading with non-invasive scaffolding and varied verbal participation to elaborate knowledge, promoting literal and inferential comprehension and more opportunities for the students to construct knowledge. By contrast, less effective teachers use reading with invasive scaffolding and little verbal participation of the students to consolidate knowledge, promoting mainly literal comprehension. This study shed light on different approaches teachers use to foster reading comprehension for science learning."

Forty-five articles published over 16 years were selected. The results were organised using three levels of impact: faculty, institution, and students. This paper analyzes the characteristics, the evaluation of the level of impact, and the changes in different types of teacher education. It is concluded that PFDs can contribute to better teaching in which the role of the teacher is valued from a student-centered perspective, but that this does not necessarily translate into a transfer to the classroom and increased Learning Outcomes."

Sleep quality is an important psychophysical condition for an adequate development of higher education formative processes. This raises questions regarding its role on the acquisition of professional skills in competency-based educational models. A descriptive-correlational design is applied and 153 students from a Chilean state university are surveyed. The results show that there is no association between sleep quality and oral and written communication, but significant differences are observed between these variables when assessing by gender, degree program, and written communication. It is concluded that for engineering students there is no mediating effect between sleep quality, drowsiness, and the ability to communicate orally or in writing."
2004,-1,"TITLE: CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROMISING | KEYWORDS: contract theory; contracting; contracts; jurisprudence; philosophy of law; private law theory; promises; promising | ABSTRACT: There is one proposition about the nature of contracts that most lawyers and contract law scholars will take as evidently true: a contract is, at least in part, constituted by a promise or group of promises. This basic dogma about the nature of contract - one taught in law schools and widely endorsed by scholars as well as by the Restatement (Second) of Contracts - is the 'promissory theory' of contract. Contract theorists who defend versions of the promissory theory often disagree about some important aspects of contract law's structure and justification but still hold that entering into a contract necessarily consists, at least in part, in making a promise: promising is always necessary for contracting, even if it is often not sufficient. In this article, I argue against the promissory theory and offer an alternative account of contract. I contend that contract law is not merely the law of legally enforceable promises: it is the law that regulates a broader class of rights-modifying agreements, of which promises are just a subset. I call this broader class of agreements juridical transactions. 'Promises are certainly constitutive of some juridical transactions but are completely absent in others. Thus, the notion of a contract is broader and richer than that of a promise, which I argue is present in just one species of contract. Furthermore, I contend that under the promissory theory of contract lies a 'monistic,' overly restrictive view of the sources of contractual obligation. By contrast, I defend what I will call a pluralistic' view. I claim that contractual obligations do not only have their source in the parties' promises but also in non-promissory sources such as customs or legislation. The account of contract I propose redefines the boundaries between contract and other areas of private law such as property law and invites an important revision of our approach to basic topics in contract theory, such as the relationship between contract and voluntariness, the status of legally implied contractual terms, our understanding of the idea and value of freedom of contract, and the conditions under which boilerplate or standard form contracts should be (unenforceable. Although the account of the nature of contract I will propose invites us to revise some widespread assumptions about the functioning of contract law, it could also be understood as simply tracking and making sense of the developments that the law of contracts has already experienced. In its modern form, the dynamic body of law that constitutes the law of contracts has in many ways already abandoned the rigid confinements imposed by the promissory theory. What the modern law of contract lacks is an upgraded theoretical framework for thinking about contracts - one that allows the practice of contract to flourish more freely and thus adapt to recurring societal changes."

Comparative analysis of four case studies in neighbourhoods of Barcelona | KEYWORDS: Barcelona; Community action; health; inequalities; public policy | ABSTRACT: In a context of welfare austerity and growing inequalities many citizens ask for public sector reforms in the health sector and for community action as a relevant practice. However, analyses of community action for health are still limited to single actions. For this reason, this article analyzes community action for health as a whole process of a public intervention in the neighbourhood context, including multiple actors and actions. Based on research on four disadvantaged districts in Barcelona, we develop and apply an analytical tool that allows to identify facilitators and challenges of community action for health on three dimensions of policy: symbolic (why), substantive (what) and operational (how). In this regard, several factors emerge as key ones: generating a shared discourse on health and its assets, developing a common and integral agenda (health promotion, prevention and treatment), ensuring institutional recognition and improving participation and involvement at all times of the different agents."
2007,8,"TITLE: Performance evaluation of rainfall data fill-in methods in two morphostructural areas of south-central Chile Evaluación de desempeño de métodos de relleno de datos pluviométricos en dos zonas morfoestructurales del Centro Sur de Chile | KEYWORDS: Fill of rainfall data; Linear regression; Morphostructural zones; Normal ratio; Performance evaluation | ABSTRACT: The quality of the information in meteorological data time series has always been a concern for the scientific community. The scarcity of information requires the use of data fill-in techniques and methods that frequently ignore the orographic features of the study area, as well as the method accuracy, leading to inaccurate results with important consequences. In this context, this paper seeks to evaluate two methods for filling rainfall data, namely Normal Ratio and Linear Regression Model (LRM), applied to two morphostructural zones in the south central region of Chile, through an error analysis of a 32-year series of precipitation data. Both methods were compared considering 65 of 112 stations across the region, located on the coastal plain and central valley. Subsequently, two time-consistent base stations were defined, one for each area; pluviometric and proximity criteria, as well as the amount of information available, were applied to choose five neighboring stations. After calculating the correlation between stations, using a probability analysis by quartiles and the Shapiro-Wilk test the normality of the LRM models was confirmed, as well as the homogeneity of the adjusted predictions and residuals. The Normal Ratio method evaluated rainfall estimates by weighting mean annual rainfall in the neighboring stations, where each weighting factor corresponds to the ratio between the precipitation figure recorded in the auxiliary station and the mean annual rainfall of the respective station. The performance of each method was assessed using the following estimators: Mean Error, Coefficient of Determination (CoD), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR), Mean Relative Error (MRE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The statistical analysis reveals a greater range of temporal variation in precipitation in the Central Valley relative to the Coastal Zone, except for one station, and a positive relationship between altitude and a broader pluviometric range. LRM shows greater data dispersion at station Chiguayante; moreover, according to the CoD, this is the station with the lowest prediction potential. In most of the cases analyzed, we found an inverse relationship between the sum of squared residuals (SSR) and the number of annual precipitation data available in each station. The estimators SSR, MSE, and RMSE penalize large residuals, revealing that for the 32-year series studied, The Normal Ratio yields better performance and lower prediction error in the target stations in both morphostructural areas, with Dichato as the station with the lowest mean error and Mayulermo as the station with the lowest mean relative error, for both methods in the sample selected. As Dichato was the station with the greatest Euclidean distance from the base, the distance is discarded as a major predictive factor, contrary to our findings regarding data dispersion. The analysis of residuals (SSR, MSE, RMSE) indicated that the Linear Regression Model is influenced by outliers. However, these values were considered, since eliminating the extreme values, as is usually done in regression analysis, may result in losing relevant information about maximum and minimum precipitation that is useful in the analysis of extreme climatic events such as drought. The efficiency of both methods for predicting actual values was evaluated through the estimators SSR and CoD, showing that in the present analysis, the Normal Ratio involves a higher CoD and a lower residual variability. Although regression remains a widely used and recommended method, the Normal Ratio should be reconsidered for the prediction of missing data in precipitation series in areas of south central Chile with records available for neighboring stations that could support the equation for the data required. The quadratic estimators MSE and RMSE allow inferring that those stations showing a lower mean error, where the predictive methods analyzed were most successful, were the stations where precipitation showed a more stable behavior around the mean. The dimensionless estimators MRE and MAPE confirmed the advantage of the Normal Ratio and determined that the best mean performance of the prediction was related to data dispersion rather than to the Euclidean distance between stations and the base station. The two methods evaluated offer a simple way to estimate meteorological data when the information available is insufficient; however, the Normal Ratio demonstrated a better performance relative to LRM for estimating missing precipitation data, regardless of the geomorphological area selected."

The objective of this research is to describe and analyse the behaviours associated with emotional regulation that affect the way students participate in the classroom and contribute to the subject matter. From the mixed methods perspective, an observational study was carried out based on an N/F/M (Nomothetic/Follow-up/Multidimensional) design. The members of nine primary education classes were systematically observed. The data record, obtained from an instrument designed ad hoc, is qualitative, and is organized to be coded and analysed quantitatively. Once the classes were analysed, the presence of multiple cases was detected. The results show how the associated behaviours contribute, change, insist on and distract from the topic of conversation, influencing the way in which focused attention is maintained. The discussion highlights the existence of a ‘virtuous circle’ that favours focusing on the topic through the coexistence of the behaviours of contributing to the topic with an informative language and encouraging the participation of others."

The extended Clark’s triangle is used to explore these transformations. The results identify the post-reform trajectories of both countries. In Chile, the regulatory reforms enhanced the role of the state as evaluator and funder, consolidated a more regulated private market, and reduced the influence of the academic sector. In Ecuador, they reduced the state’s control but strengthened its role as evaluating agency, increasing the influence of higher education institutions and universities, and promoting more managerial approaches in private higher education institutions. The reforms brought about greater state intervention in Chile and less state intervention in Ecuador, with significant changes in both countries."

This study provides a comparative analysis of academic roles in Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Portugal, based on data from the Academic Profession in the Knowledge-Based Society (APIKS) survey. Seven dimensions are examined: research and teaching interests, teaching activities, teaching evaluation, research orientation, institutional expectations of research, governance and institutional management and job satisfaction. The results show a widespread preference for combining teaching and research, albeit with national variations. Argentina tends towards teaching, while Mexico prioritises research. Portugal and Chile show a more balanced distribution of interests between research and teaching. Teaching remains central, with high participation in Argentina and Portugal, but lower participation in Mexico. Teaching evaluation is stricter in Mexico and Argentina, but more flexible in Chile and Portugal. Research in Mexico and Argentina is practice-oriented, with little emphasis on technology transfer. Institutional expectations of research are higher in Chile and Mexico. Job satisfaction is lower in Argentina and Portugal, suggesting room for improvement. The results highlight the diverse impacts of NPM on academic professions, reflecting global trends with local specificities."

As the plausibility of the arguments depends on structural conditions, argumentative changes also shed light on changes in these conditions. We argue, more particularly, that the orientation of the debate shifted from religion vs. science to politics and to the economy, and that the ways in which education had to position itself and ensure support for its expansion thus also changed in the period of the ‘long’ nineteenth century. The specifics of this constellation might be distinctive of the social and educational landscape in Chile, but analyses of this constellation might also help clarifying the expansion of mass education in various other nation-states, and hence contribute to our understanding of the complexities of world society."
2012,0,"TITLE: Latin American social sciences in a managerial university regime Las ciencias sociales latinoamericanas en un régimen universitario gerencial | KEYWORDS: higher education; Latin America; managerialism; social sciences | ABSTRACT: This work explores managerialism's influence on social sciences in Latin American universities. It looks at how management structures and practices impact academic work in this area of knowledge. It is proposed that managerialism, emphasizing efficiency and effectiveness, restricts the development of theoretical and methodological diversity in the discipline, endorsing easily measurable approaches that are more aligned with academic productivity indicators. Through Niklas Luhmann’s theory, this work offers an understanding of universities as decision systems. It analyzes how these institutions manage complexity through regulatory programs that organize their decisions around specific purposes determined by principles such as quantification and bureaucratization. Last, it is suggested that current models in the context of social sciences of Latin American universities, where critical thinking, and commitment to social problems should play a central role in academic work, need to be reviewed."

This paper takes inspiration from the sociology of translation to examine how leading Latin American institutions are addressing these challenges at both organizational and cultural levels. The findings indicate that cultural transformation is prevalent, strongly influenced by the Latin American tradition of extension. However, at the organizational level, imitation is more relevant, as evidenced by the adoption of new public management principles to devise strategies, plans, and programs that prioritize professionalization and the widespread use of indicators. This development gives rise to a distinct cultural internationalization model for Latin American universities."
2014,0,"TITLE: Managerialism and Academics Identities in Chilean Universities: A Case of Study Gerencialismo e identidades académicas en las universidades chilenas: Un estudio de caso | KEYWORDS: academic identity; higher education; managerialism; organizational change; reflexivity | ABSTRACT: This research analyzes the impact of managerialism on academic identities at a public university in Chile. Through a case study, it delves into how managerial practices prioritizing efficiency and performance metrics transform university management and the work of its academics. Based on Archer's concept of reflexivity, the research explores how academics negotiate the tension between traditional academic identities and new productivity demands, leading to different modes of reflexivity: autonomous, meta-reflexive, fractured, and communicative. The findings illustrate that, although academics have pragmatically adjusted to managerial demands, this does not necessarily imply an ideological acceptance of such practices. Additionally, the study reveals a diversification and redefinition of academic identity, reflecting the complex interplay between institutional demands and individual perceptions. The conclusion suggests that managerialism leads to a reconfiguration of the environment and identity of academic in Chilean universities, with an increasing emphasis on research and productivity over teaching, both significantly shaped by the managerial context in which they operate."

A multiple case study is developed using the deductive content analysis technique. The results suggest that management of “linkage with the environment” has changed, adopting principles of the new public management theory through centralized decisions, the emergence of new administrative units, and the creation of instances of systematization, monitoring and assessment of academic activities. However, the “linkage with the environment” appraisal has not changed. The logic of generating resources in association with the productive private sector is maintained -as is usual in the new public management model applied in advanced industrialized countries- and creating networks based on extension and social commitment."

Although relevant as a political-ideological critique, such analyses remain at the level of personal attribution, without questioning the social conditions of possibility of the statements. In this essay we suggest that the notions emerging today in the post-pandemic scenario should be considered as a new expression of three referents that, with different approaches, are presented in normative discussions about the university: equity, comprehensiveness and relevance. As a result, the idea of the contemporary university is that of an inherently modern university, which still follows the Enlightenment mandate to dare to think, but extends it to the questioning of its own foundations, finding in continuous self-criticism its controversial (and impossible) mission: always more equitable, more integral and more pertinent."

These changes force universities to behave as market organizations aiming to collect resources from tuition in a competitive environment, hindering their public role. Since student tuition is the main financial entrance for Chilean universities, they have been compelled to transform themselves at the management level to be competitive, attract students and reach funds from enrollment. This article aims to examine how the governance and management of a Chilean state university face the pressures to position itself competitively in the recruitment of undergraduate students and what tensions this generates internally within the central administration. The hypothesis guiding this study is that these pressures generate a series of organizational and cultural tensions in the central administration. We studied a Chilean upper-sized, research-oriented, state university through semi-structured interviews with managers at the core level. We analyzed the strategies developed in the educational market and the rising struggles that emerged from the transformation, looking at the institutional identity. Results show that the university changes its structure due to the market pressures at the organizational level. These changes take shape by designing strategic plans and including new professional staff to improve their position in the educational market. Also, the university adapts these innovations as part of its institutional ethos within the new public management framework. The article ends with a summary and suggestions for future studies of organizational change in universities."

Following Trow's hypothesis regarding the impact of the expansion of access possibilities on the concept of university, we describe the transition from an ideal conception of the Latin American university as dedicated to the formation of society’s elites into massive national systems of heterogeneous composition, that meet the demands for information, knowledge, skills and certifications for the job market and social mobility. Throughout this process, the very idea of university changes, from the university committed to the transformation of society to an institution that forms human capital"

This essay applies elements of Luhmann social systems theory to propose a new approach to those important discussions. We propose that the minimum attributes required for any entity to take part in communication -and hence in society- are the access to the medium of meaning, and to a shared mediality, implying in turn both material and semiotic conditions. Thus, we propose the idea of a 'cosmic sociology', and we discuss its analytical advantages for understanding contemporary society in its human and non-human dimensions."

Revisión del concepto en la literatura en educación superior | KEYWORDS: Academic culture; Higher education; Universities | ABSTRACT: Academic culture has a long tradition in higher education studies; nevertheless, only a few studies on this concept are available. This article aims to review the use of the concept of academic culture in higher education literature based on a bibliographic review, supported by bibliometric techniques, of studies on this topic in the last twenty years, paying special attention to state of the art in the Latin American context. The results show a growing use of the concept, which has not been yet linked to a clear definition that could conduce to the consolidation of a field of study of the cultural dimension of the sector. Specifically, there are four lines of research on academic culture: the impact of changes in the political economy on the traditional values of higher education institutions, the challenges of international exchange of students and academics, the recognition of implicit biases in the dominant academic culture, and the relationship between tacit regulations and organizational reform processes. This article also addresses how the fundamentally atheoretical character of academic culture studies mirrors the state of research in higher education, particularly in the Latin American context."

However, less attention has been paid to the effects of academic culture on undergraduate and graduate teaching. This article proposes a conceptual model, based on analytical induction, which identifies three levels of academic culture: higher education culture, professional and disciplinary culture, and institutional culture. It is argued that the beliefs of students, academics and management teams about the role of research and extension are fundamental to university teaching. Based on the above review, the importance of understanding the impact of academic culture on undergraduate and graduate education is revealed by exemplifying its significance for Latin American institutions."

The focus of study was the intellectual and political debates held on the role of these institutions, starting at national independence in the 19th century until the present. The results show that an acceptance of universities' elitist nature is transitioning to a positive evaluation of the expansion of enrollment, due to its impact on the formation of human capital. The impact of academic capitalism has therefore led to an abandonment of the traditional conception of universities. It has been replaced by the idea of human capital and the transition from a system guided by a sole model to one in which diverse descriptions compete."
2030,-1,"TITLE: Varieties of academic capitalism: A conceptual framework of analysis Variedades do capitalismo académico: Um quadro conceptual de análise Variedades de capitalismo académico: Un marco conceptual de análisis | KEYWORDS: Academic capitalism; Markets; Privatism; Privatization; Universities | ABSTRACT: This article proposes a conceptual framework for the analysis of varieties of academic capitalism. The central thesis maintains that these varieties arise from the specific characteristics that in each country organize the the three vertical blocks that make up national systems of higher education (HE): (i) its grounding political economy structure, (ii) the organizational field and the coordination dynamics between universities, and (iii) the systems’ governance modalities, its policy paradigm and instruments. Each variety of academic capitalism is characterized by the degree of privatism in these three blocks and their constituent elements. Thus, in the case of the political economy regime, the level of private presence in the provision and financing of a system plays a determining role and, therefore, the degree of marketization, commodification, commercialization and financialization of higher education. In the case of the organizational field, the impact of these previous processes on the entrepreneurialization and managerialism of participating institutions and on the competition and coordination of HE is of particular interest, as well as the degree of freedom and regulation that prevail in the relevant HE markets. Finally, the governance of academic capitalism depends in each case on the paradigms that guide public policies, the selection of policy instruments, and the way in which stakeholders participate in the governance structure. A brief summary and identification of future research lines for further studying varieties of academic capitalism complete this article."

Evolution of external quality assurance mechanisms in Chile ¿En qué confiamos al evaluar la calidad de las universidades? Evolución de los mecanismos externos de aseguramiento de la calidad en Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Chilean higher education; Expert systems; Institutional trust; Quality assurance systems | ABSTRACT: The contemporary higher education systems depend on the existence of institutions responsible for ensuring the quality of their activities. The Chilean case is no exception in this regard. The creation of the Higher Education Council in 1990 was the starting point for the development of an expert assessment system for universities, consolidated with the inauguration of the National Accreditation Commission in 2006. Despite their importance, there do not seem to be studies on the history of these quality assurance mechanisms, nor on how their evolution can be explained from a general sociological theory. To make progress in this analysis, the authors, following Niklas Luhmann’s thesis, put forward that trust is socially constructed and that its form of configuration depends on changes in the structure of society. Using these ideas, the evolution of quality assurance mechanisms in higher education since the 19th century in Chile is reviewed and the results suggest that the emphasis on expert knowledge is a recent phenomenon which can be explained as a consequence of the change in the way society is structured. This sociological analysis, based on Luhmann’s theory of social systems, ends with a summary, possible lines of research, and recommendations for higher education policy."

However, to a large extent, such analyzes operate at an abstract level, without necessarily discussing their potentialities at the empirical level. This article proposes the idea of organizational coordination, inspired by the guidelines of the theory of social systems, and uses it as an axis of analysis to understand the problems faced internally today by the National Service for Minors (SENAME). Based on this analysis, the main coordination problems in this organization are identified, proposing twelve descriptors for their observation and measurement. These descriptors are then used to present a proposal of coordination typologies, discussing their implications with the possibilities of implementing effective interventions, having as horizons the focus of rights and the best interests of the child."

Tensiones discursivas en la Universidad de Chile | KEYWORDS: Higher education; Innovation; Knowledge society; Transdiscipline; Universidad de Chile | ABSTRACT: Amidst contemporary social transformations, including the new role adopted by universities, transdisciplinarity has been gaining increasing recognition as an approach to understanding phenomena that cannot be addressed by the traditional model of disciplinary specialization: these include climate change, inequality, or, more recently, pandemics. However, there is little study of specific experiences that help to understand the implications, purpose, and challenges of adopting a transdisciplinary approach in universities. In order to reduce this gap, this article analyses the results of a participatory dialogue carried out in Universidad de Chile, examining different narratives regarding the emergence of transdisciplinarity and the associated opportunities and obstacles. These, in turn, relate to the historical, organizational, and cultural dynamics of the trajectory adopted by this institution, and the higher education sector in general, in the country: i) the social commitment, inscribed in the tradition and academic mission of the public university; ii) a promise of novelty, innovation, and transformation of scientific and academic work, associated with the emerging model of an entrepreneurial university; and, iii) the growing demand for a profound reform of the higher education system in the country."

Interviews were held with academics at both public and private well-established universities and new private universities. The analysis shows a consensus regarding the production of certain public goods such as knowledge, wider access and the promotion of a public sphere. It also reveals a dissensus such that academics at well-established universities tend to maintain a statist view of the public university in which the state plays a key role while academics at new private universities characteristically adopt an individualist view in which the university is detached from the state and more focused on securing social mobility. Drawing on an Archerian framework, it is suggested that these perceptions have been shaped by global, national and especially institutional factors. Critical questions arise concerning the possibility of spaces for new perceptions of the public dimension of universities."

Based on these developments, we explore how Latin American higher education, especially after consolidating a growing private sector, is currently moving away from the previously dominant idea of universities as institutions for educating societies’ elites, an idea that is now being replaced by the increasing acknowledgment of the essential role of academic organizations in meeting demands for access to information, knowledge, job market qualifications and social mobility. Throughout this process, the very concept of university has changed radically, leading to mixed positive and negative reactions among the region’s academics and intellectuals."

Building upon Luhmann’s theory of society, we analyze in this paper the expansion of higher education in Chile, specifically looking at the transformations of this system and the interactions between this system and its social environment. We include statistics to clarify the extent of the changes and the costs of increasing inclusion. We also focus on historical changes in the ways the expansion (or contraction) of higher education in Chile is legitimized. Altogether, our analysis show not just how the Chilean system of higher education adapts to its social environment, but also how both individuals and other function systems currently adapt to this system and how it is organized. We end with a brief reflection on the ways in which education may or may not constitute an important social difference and a discussion of the relevance of our findings for analyses of the evolution of other countries’ education systems."

The present article reviews the specialized literature on the theory of academic capitalism. It seek to specify and develop its basic concepts, and uses them to analyze the Chilean case, both from the point of view of the political economy of its national system of Higher Education and the transformations that universities are undergoing in the direction of entrepreneurial behavior and managerialism. METHOD. A bibliometric analysis of the specialized literature on academic capitalism in English, Spanish, and Portuguese is carried out and then a content analysis is performed with the objective of identifying the different understandings of academic capitalism. RESULTS. Two definitions of academic capitalism are identified: one that focuses on changes at the level of the political and economic systems and the other that revolves around transformations at the organizational level. DISCUSSION. Building upon this basis, an analytical framework is proposed for the study of academic capitalism, distinguishing between political economy processes (marketization, privatization, commercialization and financialization) and their organizational effects (university entrepreneurialism and managerialism). Later, this framework is used to study the Higher Education reform carried out in Chile between the years 2014 and 2018, and aimed at reversing or mitigating the advanced degree of privatism of its Higher Education system. The transformations experienced by academic capitalism as a result of this reform are identified, leading to the conclusion that the outcomes of this process are limited and in some cases ambiguous, and might even cause unanticipated effects, contrary to the objective sought. The article concludes with a brief summary and possible future research lines."

Social sciences have reacted by producing information on their impacts in different spheres of social life, particularly regarding economy, politics, and science. However, there has been not so much consideration about how the functionally differentiated structure of society favors or restricts collaborative attempts to address the pandemic. Specifically, in this way, social systems theory will be applied to identify systemic mechanisms of reflection and rationality that could stimulate collaboration, and then propose organizational modes that would foster it."
2041,-1,"TITLE: The modern idea of university: From the ivory tower towards academic capitalism Idea moderna de universidad: De la torre de marfil al capitalismo académico | KEYWORDS: Aims of education; Capitalism; Knowledge; State; University; University faculty | ABSTRACT: This article analyzes the evolution of discourses about the modern university by presenting a reflexive reading of classical and contemporary texts on the passage from a university conceived as an ivory tower to the entrepreneurial university, and the strains it creates in terms of formative principles and knowledge organization. To do so, the article begins by arguing that the university becomes part of the Enlightenment and accesses to modernity when the Faculty of Philosophy ceases to be conceptualized as the handmaiden of the Faculty of Theology (philosophia theologiae ancilla) and grows to be understood as the mistress’ torchbearer, as ironically remarked by Kant. In the following decades, the new role that philosophy adopts in the division of academic labor changes the relationship of the institution with both the political and religious powers, opening the door on the road to the nation state and, further down, to the subordination of its activities to global academic capitalism. Consequently, traditional normative referents, as those proclaimed by Kant and Humboldt where universities were conceived as responsible for the evolution of modern society, lose plausibility and are subjected to the criticism of ideologies. The article concludes by examining future trends in education and research conducted in contemporary universities and by arguing that the crisis of the modern idea of the university is, in fact, an expression of its modern character that now turns against this very institution."

We analyze the reception of academic capitalism theory in Latin America. To meet this objective, the conceptual underpinnings of academic capitalism are explored as well as their criticisms in the specialized literature. Next, the Latin-American reception of this conceptual approach is examined in detail, with special attention to the ways in which this approach is used to evaluate national higher education systems. Building upon this analysis, it is argued that the Latin-American reception process shows limitations both in quantitative and qualitative terms and is frequently used to criticize the state of higher education systems rather than to understand them.

Un análisis desde la teoría de sistemas sociales | KEYWORDS: Ecological rationality; Environment; Environmental education; Social systems theory; Socialization | ABSTRACT: As a result of the multiple ecological problems affecting contemporary society, environmental education has become increasingly important in recent decades. However, despite its importance, this concern does not seem to have gone hand in hand with the consideration of environmental education within the framework of a complex enought sociological theory. As we will argue in this article, this has had important effects in the conceptualization of environmental education, which is hence generally described as a process of ethical socialization with the aim of improving society. Using the distinctions of Luhmann's social systems theory of social systems between a) psychic and social systems and b) different functional systems, we will propose an understanding of environmental education as an intentional effort to socialize about the relationship between society and its physical environment, which, as part of the communications of a specialized system, reflect society's form of differentiation. Once this definition is proposed, we will propose a model of environmental education for a functionally differentiated society, taking Chile as example. The article closes with a summary, future lines of research and policy recommendations."

Moreover, it offers curriculum designers a pedagogical approach which moves away from a more didactic, knowledge-led curriculum to a more active, student-centred approach to learning. However, it is often suggested that PjBL in engineering education is more directed to the application of knowledge as opposed to the acquisition of knowledge. This is seen to limit both the learning outcomes of PjBL and the likelihood of students developing both generic skills alongside disciplinary knowledge and technical skills. Drawing on qualitative data collected through observations of PjBL activities and interviews with undergraduate engineering students in situ, we show how students develop their disciplinary understanding through collaborative learning and engagement."

Andrés Lamas y la historia de la República Oriental del Uruguay | KEYWORDS: 19thcentury; Andrés Lamas; Historiography; Intellectual work; Uruguay | ABSTRACT: Andrés Lamas was designated, through a governmental decree, to write Historia de la República Oriental del Uruguay in 1849. The state provided him with the necessary economic and logistic resources to do so. This, added to his broad diplomatic experience and intellectual bonds on a transnational scale, gave him access to several documentary sources and bibliographic material that were useful to produce the piece. Nevertheless, at his deathbed in 1891 – forty years after his designation and assignment – the piece was unfinished and there were no drafts that allowed foreseeing its prompt culmination. Thus, the objective of this article is to analyze the creation process of Historia de la República Oriental de Uruguay, which will help you recognize the characteristics of the historical practice in the 19th century and tell you about the importance of Lamas in the makeup of the historiographical field of Río de la Plata, thus proving that behind the project’s failure was the need – on behalf some of the 19th century’s highly educated elites - to do “preparatory works” that would lay the ground for the historical work of the following generation of historians."

The theoretical framework that sustains this research is inscribed in the field of Film Music Studies, both its foundational referents from the Anglo world and the most recent works focused on Latin America. This conceptual apparatus is intertwined with testimonies of composers and critics, as well as a detailed musical analysis. The work includes the transcription of a series of pieces composed or arranged by Andreani. This study shed light on the different aspects of the work of musical composition for classical cinema in Argentina and Chile: what were the requirements of the film companies, what they sought to communicate with the music and how composers materialized all these needs."

These categories help to understand the strategies that filmmakers use to read musical matters from a documentary perspective. I argue that music documentary is inscribed within the so-called ""turn towards the intimate"" of Chilean documentary more broadly as well as within the production on memory in the post-dictatorship both in the fields of documentary film and music historiography."

Trayectorias de América Latina hacia un Acuerdo de Libre Comercio con los Estados Unidos (1990-2015) | KEYWORDS: Economic Liberalization; Institutional Change; Latin America; Market Reforms; Regionalism; Survival Analysis | ABSTRACT: This paper discusses the entry into force of trade agreements between Latin American countries and the United States. The objective is to study paths towards the implementation of a free trade agreement with the world’s greatest power in the period 1990-2015, considering three groups of variables: market reforms, geopolitics of trade agreements and commercial links with the world. The results suggest that market reforms have the greatest explanatory impact on the principal outcome of this study. The research technique used was Event History Analysis, implemented through Cox regression, in order to identify determinants that explain the process. Although this approach has been widely used in the field of international relations, mainly in the study of conflicts or crises, it is novel in the analysis of the entry into force of trade agreements."

Using qualitative methods, this article explores how keys stakeholders are perceiving and responding to climate change in such a complex social and environmental context. Results show this phenomenon is perceived as an emergent issue, whose social and environmental impacts are already happening. Generally individual responses are implemented, prevailing power asymmetries and competition over cooperation, coordination and exchange of experiences between stakeholders. A climate change governance system for the island should deal not only with institutional barriers but also promote social and cultural transformations."

By analyzing its programming and films since its creation in 1994 until 2019, it is possible to establish how the festival has positioned itself as the crucial ""site of passage"" for a new generation of Chilean filmmakers and producers before and during its consolidation within the global circuit of film festivals. In over 25 years, FICValdivia has experienced significant changes in terms of its editorial line, from an ecological perspective, through an industrial frame, and, recently, under the direction of Raúl Camargo, to a deeply film-oriented curatorial line. Thus, FICValdivia has positioned itself as a meeting point for the cinephilia and the Chilean film community."

Utilizing Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), we identified the use of linguistics strategies such as the generalization and impersonalization of actors, and the authorization based on an expert discourse, as ways of undermining the role played by the Teachers' Union during the discussion of the project. We also identified the conception of the ideal teacher, who was characterized as docil, willing to be constantly evaluated, and apolitical."

Using critical discourse analysis and framing, we conclude that the newspapers tend to naturalize the deficiencies of this evaluation instrument and to dismiss the arguments that criticize its continued use. Therefore, the processing of conflicts around this measurement is subject to the normalization that these journalistic discourses provide to the educational field, thus reinforcing the growing influence of the media in the formulation of educational policies, in a process known as mediatization of education."
2060,0,"TITLE: Effects of the implementation of practical activities on achievement motivation in college students Efectos de la implementación de actividades prácticas sobre la motivación de logro en estudiantes universitarios | KEYWORDS: academic success; laboratory; motivation; Physiology | ABSTRACT: Introduction: Motivation is that which drives an individual towards a goal, entailing actions and accepting the effort required to achieve it. It can be extrinsic, associated with external factors such as recognition or punishment, and intrinsic, related to what arises from the individual themselves, such as self-fulfillment and personal develop-ment. Achievement motivation is a form of intrinsic motivation that encourages the pursuit of solutions to problems without the need for rewards. It constitutes a precursor to learning, serving as its driving force. Therefore, in edu-cation, it is essential to employ strategies that enhance students’ achievement motivation. Objective: Evaluate the effects of incorporating practical laboratory activities in teaching human physiology on achievement motivation attributions in physical therapy students. Method: Attributions of achievement motivation were assessed in undergraduate students at the end of two equivalent human physiology subjects in two consecutive semesters using the Modified Attributional Achievement Motivation Scale (EAML-M). The first subject was based on traditional activities, while in the second one, practical laboratory activities of exercise physiology were also implemented. Results: The EAML-M dimension with the highest score at the end of both subjects was “interest/effort”. Significant differences were found in two dimensions between se-mesters, specifically increases in the score “task/ability” (4.2 ± 0.56 vs. 4.6 ± 0.56; P = 0.002) and “exam” (5 [5-5] vs. 5 [4-6]; P = 0.011) in the subject that incorporated practical activities. Conclusions: These results suggest that implementing practical exercise physiology laboratory activities could improve achievement motivation attributions in undergraduate students, specifically in the dimensions “task/ ability” and “exam”. In addition, a possible influence of gender on students’ motivation was found since, when analyzed by sex, improvements were only found in women."

This study aimed 1) to test the effects of 6 weeks of concurrent exercise including high-intensity interval plus resistance training (CTHIIT+RT) on the arterial stiffness condition of individuals with different blood pressure controls, and 2) to compare the magnitude of exercise adaptations among different blood pressures and vascular characteristics. An experimental clinical randomized study was conducted in six categories (three controls and three experimental groups) of adults who were divided into six groups: control hypertensive (CG-HTN, n=10), control elevated blood pressure (CG-ELE, n=10), control normotensive (CG-NT, n=10), experimental hypertensive (ExG-HTN, n=10), elevated blood pressure (ExG-ELE, n=10), or normotensive (ExG-NT, n=10). The participants underwent 6 weeks of concurrent training with 5 min of high-intensity interval plus 5 min of resistance training (CTHIIT+RT), where systolic pulse wave velocity of the brachial artery (PWVba) (primary outcome) and additional secondary blood pressure, body composition, and vascular outcomes were measured before and after 6 weeks of intervention. After 6 weeks of CTHIIT+RT, significant reductions in ΔPWVba were reported in ExG-HTN vs. ExG-NT (diff. 0.86 m/s-1) and between ExG-ELE and ExG-NT (diff. 0.76 m/s-1). In conclusion, 6 weeks of CTHIIT+RT reduced arterial stiffness in adults with different blood pressure controls, but with a superior magnitude in HTN patients. Additional benefits include remission of high blood pressure in patients with hypertension."

This study aimed 1) to describe and compare the HR during exercise between HTN and normotensive adults and 2) to describe the endothelial function and related vascular parameters in both groups. A descriptive clinical study was conducted with 64 adults (men and women) who were divided into three groups: arterial hypertension (HTN n=26), elevated blood pressure (Ele n=16), or normotensive control (CG n=22). The participants underwent an incremental cycling exercise test of 5 stages, where HR (primary outcome) was measured, and secondary vascular outcomes (percentile classification of the pulse wave velocity (%ILEPWVba), maximum carotid intima-media thickness (cIMTmax), and arterial age among others were measured. In stage 2 of the test (50-100 watts), the HTN group showed significantly higher HR vs. CG (+14 beats/min; p<0.05) and vs. Ele group (+15 beats/min; p<0.05), and in stage 5 (125-250 watts), HTN group showed higher HR vs. CG (+22 beats/min; p<0.05). HTN group showed a higher arterial stiffness by %ILEPWVba classification and arterial age estimation than the CG group. In conclusion, HTN patients reported a higher HR response only in two out of five (monitored) stages of the Astrand cycling exercise test than normotensive peers. Moreover, all groups showed a higher HRpredicted than real HRpeak obtained from the exercise test. These results are displayed with more altered vascular parameters in the HTN group."

The objective is to analyze the geographies of the provision of social housing in Medellín and its metropolitan environment within the framework of the public policies of the neoliberal urban regime. Methodologically, it is developed through three phases: a theoretical review of the change of urban regime going from a developmentalist regime to a neoliberal one, the identification of the legal-technical framework that governs the provision of social housing in Colombia and, finally, a characterization of the structuring processes of a new neoliberal urban regime in terms of the provision of social housing in the metropolitan environment of Medellín, contrasting the public policies of housing provision with the geographies produced by them with the building activity. The results show how new geographies of social housing provision have been produced in the last two decades, with the management model prevailing on each property basis and the growth of urbanization on a regional scale."

The objective of this article is to study the regulation and management models that have guided the redevelopment processes (overlapping and densification) in the center of Medellín between 1959 and 2022 under the different forms of urban regimes —developmentalist and neoliberal—, from an approach geo-historical theoretical-methodological with a qualitative approach. As a result, two geo-historical periods of urban planning in Medellín are reconstructed to characterize and analyze the different models of planning, management and financing of redevelopment processes, and their spatial implications and housing provision in the center of the city. city. Finally, the discussion is in the current redevelopment model that is deployed under the logic of a typology of strategic planning with a mercantilist perspective that, despite the regulation and financing strategies that have been sophisticated since the mid-nineties, have not achieved a significant provision of commercial and social housing in the center of the city."

The methodology used was a comparative spatial analysis between the location of natural threats due to mass movements and floods of the Medellín Territorial Planning Plan (2014) and the total risk due to climate change of the Medellín Action Plan 2020-2050 (2021) with the behavior of the spatial distribution of female heads in the intercensal period 2005-2018. The results show a spatial correlation between the areas most exposed to these threats and risks at medium and high levels with the areas that received the greatest percentage increases in female heads of household. In addition, these areas have historically presented the most vulnerable socioeconomic indicators of the city. It is concluded that public territorial planning policies require a comprehensive gender approach —political, economic and cultural— in the formulation, management and financing of policies, strategies, programs and projects to confront climate change."

The regulatory frameworks at the polygon scale are analyzed: the urban treatments in Medellín and their implications in the building activity regarding the number of property units, the value per treatment and the participation in the different socioeconomic strata. The results show that, despite the instrumental diversification, the main urban transformations of the last two decades have occurred under the traditional private “property-to-property” management model with a regulatory framework that favors redensification processes in middle-and high-income sectors, while policies to promote self-construction are reduced and renovation processes are promoted in popular sectors with impacts on the distribution of urban income and socio-spatial organization."

A dimension little explored, but key in this field, is the social and spatio-temporal praxis of the promoter-builder agents. Therefore, the objective of the article is to identify whether the scales of housing production, as well as the social and spatial scales of developer-builders in the metropolitan region of Medellín during the expansive real estate cycle between 2004 and 2018, suggest dynamics of articulation. Based on trade statistics of housing projects built, the scales of production and social and spatial performance are comparatively analyzed in the three areas by means of descriptive indicators, correlation coefficients and the construction of price isopleths. A tendency towards concentration of developer-constructor capitals was found, which is expressed in a growing integration at a metropolitan regional scale of the different segments of capitalist production of housing, with serious implications in the rapid increase of housing prices and a phenomenon of spatial convergence of these throughout the metropolitan region of Medellin. It concludes on the social and environmental implications of the current configuration of scales of production and social and spatial performance, as well as on evidence pointing to an emerging financialization of housing production."

Therefore, this article aims to identify how the different regulatory stages of the tax paying have been modeled by the urban regimes prevailing in Colombia (the second stage is the neoliberal urban regime, 1990-2014). It also describes how the taxation is implemented in the district El Poblado, in Medellín. Based on the georeferencing and systematization of historical series of public works financed by these revenues, this paper shows the spatial patterns in each of the described stages. It was found that this tool provided a prime role in the city public finances, up to the 1970s, and then declined. However, the real estate appreciation impacted directly on two stages of the urban morphology production in the area under study. Firstly, by articulating the suburban lattice and the city; secondly, by solving specific problems derived from the densification caused by the former process."

Ethics of joy and becoming Chilean feminist high school students in relation to ideal citizenship normativities | KEYWORDS: becomings; citizenship; ethics of joy; gender; high school feminists; neoliberalism | ABSTRACT: This article traces the narratives and experiences of feminist high school students during the Chilean feminist movement of 2018 and explores their relations with normative political and gender subjectivization processes happening at their schools. The data for this article was produced through a critical ethnographic study in a Chilean all-female public high school, which included participant observation, testimonial interviews, arts-based collective testimonial workshops, and analyzed through affect theory. This article shows how this school reproduced binary norms under traditionally feminine parameters and at the same time neoliberal ones that demanded that students be successful and resilient women who individually managed to become productive members of society in the future. The student participants in this study were critical of how their school and their teachers tried to produce them as these types of gendered citizens. They managed to become feminist students in relation to these norms and at the same time create discourses, actions, and materialities that produced more just spaces for them in the present. This article suggests that reading the relations between the feminist students’ becomings and new gendered citizenship normativity deployed at school through a relational and affirmative ethics lens identifies relevant and often unseen aspects in research about structural oppression and resistance."

We critically explore the celebration of reading for socioemotional education as it is produced in official government documents distributed to schools in Chile. Assisted by Sara Ahmed’s conceptualisation of the cultural politics of emotions and Chantal Mouffe’s agonistic theory, we highlight how literary reading is promoted as a tool to manage difference and resolve conflict. We relate the hopes set on reading to a celebratory cult of happiness in which structural injustices are erased."

We argue that some Catholic schools in Chile reproduce the category ‘woman’ as a pure, selfless, sexy, heterosexual mother who is an inferior and erasable being that is frequently discounted. This reproduction is done via different procedures of shaming, silencing, and even sexual violence. We experienced the telling of these testimonios as troubling but productive. First, this paper addresses the ideologies, values, and practices that Catholic schools construct around gender. Second, it suggests that the telling of and engagement with stories of embodied experiences is a beneficial strategy to battle gender oppression and work through productive discomfort and affects. Finally, the article considers the importance of dismantling subjectivity formation processes that consider some bodies as disposable."

The article explores the ways in which these feminist students participate and interact with others on these websites while producing their gender/political subjectivities. Using narrative analysis, the paper presents their processes of subjectification as part of emerging social movement stories. I argue that these websites provide the necessary conditions for students to engage in political actions and produce their collective gender/political subjectivities as the protagonists in the feminist student social movement narratives. This process is co-constructed by the visitors to the sites, who sometimes police the students, using hegemonic discourses regarding female minors. The paper amplifies a body of research on online feminism by exploring gender and political subjectivity production through social media in a Latin American context, and calls attention to digital social movement actions as a form of political engagement in the present."

It analyzes how these particular usages were crossed by affective intensities that worked to produce students’ political subjectivities as collective and agentic. This affective work was produced with other members of the school community and sometimes was met with anger, policing practices, and desires to exclude students from particular historical narratives. The data for this article were produced within a yearlong critical ethnographic study on the processes of production of high school feminist students’ gender and political subjectivities in Chile, which included participant observation, testimonios interviews, art-based collective testimonios workshops, and analysis through affect theory. The findings show the types of historical and political narratives and symbols used by students, what affective intensities that crossed these symbols did to the students’ political subjectivities, and the conflicts these intensities produced within the school community. The article concludes by examining how these findings might open new questions within the field of social studies education research."

In this article, we survey the “affective economies” of literary reading through a textual and visual analysis of documents issued by Chile’s Ministry of Education. Through a critical and diffractive reading of these documents with Ahmed’s (2004, 2010) and Braidotti’s (2018) conceptualizations of the affective, we claim that when reading is presented as beneficial, pleasurable, and promising, an assemblage of exclusion is set into motion. We describe how the affective repertoires in these documents reinforce oppressive and exclusionary neoliberal values under the guise of the promise of future happiness. The pleasure and happiness that can be achieved through literary reading, however, is only accessible to those who are willing to orientate themselves in the “right ways.” In this orientation, the cognitive is privileged over the emotional, and readers are supposed to learn to postpone any current demands for the promise of future happiness."
2076,19,"TITLE: The two-sample two-stage least squares method to estimate the intergenerational earnings elasticity | KEYWORDS: Intergenerational mobility; Linked administrative data; Two-sample two-stage least squares | ABSTRACT: We show that the inconsistency of the Two-Sample Two-Stage Least Squares (TSTSLS) Intergenerational Earnings Elasticity (IGE) estimator is a two-way prediction problem involving the replication of (i) the variance of unobserved parental earnings, and (ii) the endogeneity of unobserved parental earnings in the equation of children’s earnings. Concretely, we show that the TSTSLS estimator asymptotically recovers the OLS IGE when the first-stage R2, i.e., the share of explained variance of parental earnings, equals the share of explained endogeneity of parental earnings in the child’s earnings equation. This condition leads to two notable outcomes with respect to previous findings in the literature: (i) perfect prediction of parental earnings is a specific instance of our condition, indicating that consistency can be attained even when parental earnings are predicted imperfectly and (ii) exogenous instruments alone are insufficient to guarantee asymptotic equivalence between TSTSLS and OLS IGE estimates. Furthermore, our condition suggests that strong first-stage instruments might amplify TSTSLS bias if they are also strongly endogenous in the child’s earnings equation. This last result provides a formal criterion for choosing first-stage predictors under the assumption that TSTSLS IGE estimates exhibit upward bias. Additionally, we theoretically study the biases of the two-sample stochastic multiple imputation and cell multiple imputation (MI) procedures, identifying conditions under which MI procedures outperform the traditional TSTSLS estimator. Finally, we validate our results through an empirical Monte Carlo exercise using administrative data from the Chilean formal private sector."
2077,19,"TITLE: Intergenerational earnings persistence and the provision of public goods: evidence from chile’s constitutional process | KEYWORDS: Intergenerational mobility; Proportional taxation; Publicly provided goods; Referendum; Social outbreak | ABSTRACT: This paper studies the relationship between intergenerational economic persistence and preferences for the provision of public goods. Specifically, we develop a simple theoretical model in which a public good is financed through proportional taxation, and that predicts a lower provision of public goods given an increase in the intergenerational earnings elasticity (IGE), which is widely recognized as a measure of the degree of economic persistence from one generation to the next in society. We test this model empirically using the results of the 2020 Chilean national plebiscite, which asked about the replacement of the standing constitution by a new one that would potentially expand the role of the state in the provision of public goods. Our estimates suggest the existence of a positive association between the IGE and the share of the vote against a new constitution, even after controlling for median income and income inequality. These findings are consistent with our model and suggest that sectors of society that exhibit higher degrees of economic persistence also show greater reluctance towards redistributive policies that increase public goods provision."

Neither of these approaches is fully satisfactory. We apply for the first time a new methodology that allows us to account for fundamentalaccrued capital gains as part of the top incomes in a theoretically consistent manner. We estimate the shares of the super-rich in Chile showing that accrued capital gains have a large impact on these estimates. Also, the top income shares estimated using fundamental capital gains appear to exhibit a more stable and presumably more plausible time profile than estimates based on capital gains derived from asset market variations."

Experiencias de practica profesional de estudiantes mujeres de Educacion Tecnico Profesional | KEYWORDS: gender discrimination; gender inequality; internship; Vocational-Technical Education | ABSTRACT: Internships are essential for student trajectories of Vocational-Technical Education (VTE), as they allow the reinforcement of learning achieved in the classroom and provide knowledge and vocational maturity that can only be completed in the labor context. This article shows the difficulties that female students face in male-dominated Vocational-Technical Education (VTE) programs during their experiences of internship in the workplace. To do this, based on 29 interviews of female graduates from these programs, we analyze the process of doing and undoing gender, and how women negotiate their gender when facing discrimination in the companies that host them as practitioners. The findings reveal women's adjustment strategies that combine resistance and acceptance in a context where companies do not adjust their dynamics and practices to integrate them. Instead, women adapt their behaviors to the cultural norms of implicit and explicit sexism in the learning workplaces. Thus, the arrival of all female students to the companies is an opening act, which requires them to conquer their own space configured from exceptionality.

The daily experiences and relationships of children worldwide have been significantly affected by the Pandemic. It is essential to understand these transformations through the voices of children. The primary aim of this research was to interpret the educational experiences of young children in Latin America during the Covid-19 health emergency. Data was collected through four strategies based on the mosaic approach: face-to-face interviews, virtual interviews, audio recordings, and drawings, involving a total of 46 children from 7 countries: Chile, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica, Brazil, and Argentina. The results show that during the pandemic, there were limitations on play, communication was primarily directed by teachers in virtual settings, children expressed a need for contact with peers, family mediation was crucial for learning, movement was restricted, and here was a greater emphasis on content of the didactic processes. This study aims to contribute to the positioning of participatory research with children as a necessary paradigm for addressing issues that concern them."
2081,0,"TITLE: Coordination and deliberation as models of public policies in inclusive education Coordinación y deliberación como modelos de políticas de inclusión educativa | KEYWORDS: Coordination; deliberation; inclusion in education; public policies | ABSTRACT: This article analyzes some guidelines of inclusive education and from there it proposes to contrast two models of social intervention: the contextual orientation model and the deliberative model. The first focuses on the coordination of actors and systems based on common objectives, but from divergent logics and interests. The second requires the construction of normative agreements on binding decisions to articulate intervention processes. For its part, inclusive education puts students and their diversity at the center to generate quality teaching-learning processes. This has resulted in the development of public policies, such as the Inclusion Law 20,845. We argue that a social policy like this can be nourished by the elements proposed by both theoretical perspectives. On the one hand, the contextual model allows us to understand as a basic element of the public policy process the diversity of logics of the actors involved. On the other hand, the deliberative model highlights the relevance of normative principles and the need for permanent dialogue between those involved."

These access barriers will be discussed in this paper, considering the analysis between Brazil and Portugal in the granting of old-age pensions to people with disabilities, to verify whether the existing criteria can generate different solutions in the granting of old-age pensions to this vulnerable group in both countries."
2083,-1,"TITLE: LABOUR COMPLIANCE AS A TOOL IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF DECENT WORK O COMPLIANCE TRABALHISTA COMO FERRAMENTA NA CONSTRUÇÃO DO TRABALHO DECENTE | KEYWORDS: Decent work; Flexibilization; Labour compliance; Modernization; Precariousness | ABSTRACT: Objective: the human needs that must be met by scarce resources in the face of infinite needs, depend on the economy which, in turn, depends on the factors of production, which include human labor. These intersubjective labor relations, within the dynamic economy, undergo constant transformations and need vertiginous adaptations so that there is regulation compatible with human aspirations and market demands. In this vein, flexibilities in labor matters often end up disguised as precariousness, as excuses to adapt the extraction of human labor to the speed of labor and economic transformations, which generates problems of different kinds for workers. In order to mitigate these precarious consequences, the ILO inaugurated the decent work agenda, which, alongside the opposite agenda established by capital, seeks its form of consecration in the daily life of global labor regulation. This work analyzes how labor compliance programs can help build decent work, within this context of labor modernization and constant changes in the way human labor is exploited. Methodology: the hypothetical-deductive method is used, through a bibliographical and documentary approach, based on books and scientific articles, in addition to the review of Brazilian legislation and international instruments on the matter. Results: it is concluded that not only is it plausible to talk about labor compliance programs, given that ethical conduct and legal compliance of organizations do not only receive influxes from abroad (heteronomous requirements), but also must be built to from within (autonomous posture) and, in this regard, these programs have a direct connection with Labor Law and Social Security Law (company-workers relationship), being a fundamental instrument to minimize risks and the generation of labor liabilities in view of the complexity of the Labor Law in Brazil. Furthermore, it was verified that such programs contribute directly to the construction of the concept of decent work. Contributions: the article analyzes the axes of the concept of decent work, observing how labor compliance programs allow its construction within organizations. Each axis studied is linked to the pillars and objectives of compliance programs, and the adoption of these programs will naturally implement aspects of the concept of decent work in labor relations."

Methodology: the deductive method is used, through a bibliographic and documentary approach, through the reading of books and scientific articles, as well as the revision of Chilean and international legislation on the subject as well as the jurisprudence. Results: working relationships are mutating. Technology is modifying these relationships for better or worse. On the other hand, it facilitates the execution of tasks, generates other ways of working and extinguishes those that are repetitive. On the other hand, it can allow the worker to remain constantly connected to his activities, to respond to demands from his employer outside the working day and the physical dependencies of the company and, in this way, harms the rest and the social and family life of the workerlas relaciones de trabajo van mutando. Contributions: the article offers as one of its contributions the debate on the right to disconnection, since it is a situation that goes beyond the mere right to rest and configures in a way that goes on to protect the right of the worker to ""exist"" much more than ""rest""."

The work is divided in two parts aiming to discuss the proposed problem. The first part approaches the Brazilian legal system, explores the guidelines of social assistance in Brazil, the requirements for the Assistance Benefit of Continued Provision and the (im)possibility of granting the benefit to resident aliens. The second part analyzes the Chilean normative system. It approaches the social assistance structure, the assistance benefits in Chile as well as its limitations regarding assistance benefits to foreigners. In this study, it was applied the bibliographic research method from a qualitative approach. It was also taken into consideration doctrines, laws and the jurisprudence related to the theme."

The sample included 91 college students, aged 18 to 24, from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and Universidad de Chile. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ) tests were used in order to explore the emotional state of the participants. A Stroop task and a Serial Reaction Time (SSRT) test were used in order to assess cognitive performance. In turn, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (RMET) face recognition task, by Baron-Cohen, was used to assess the mentalising capacity. Significant correlations were found between dependency and self-criticism dimensions, depressive symptoms and cognitive performance of the participants."
2089,-1,"TITLE: Bridging human rights and social determinants of health: Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay | KEYWORDS: Health care; Human rights; Latin America; Social determinants of health | ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to do a systematic assessment and testing of identified human rights norms alongside social determinant approaches in relation to identified health issues of concern in four Latin American countries (Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay) to show how social determinants and human rights frameworks improve population health. Design/methodology/approach: To do so, in the first part the authors analyze the inequalities both between and within each of the selected countries in terms of health status and health determinants of the population. Then, in the second section, the authors analyze the level of recognition, institutionalisation and accountability of the right to health in each country. Findings: From the data used in this paper it is possible to conclude that the four analysed countries have improved their results in terms of health status, health care and health behaviours. This improvement coincides with the recognition, institutionalisation and creation of accountability mechanisms of human rights principles and standards in terms of health and that a human rights approach to health and its relation with other social determinants have extended universal health coverage and health systems in the four analysed countries. Originality/value: Despite of the importance of the relation between human rights and social determinants of health, there are few human right scholars working on the issues of social determinants of health and human rights. Most of the literature of health and human rights has been focussed specific relations between specific rights and the right to health, but less human right scholar working on social determinants of health. On the other hand, just a few epidemiologists and people working on social medicine have actually started to use a universal human rights frame and discourse. In fact, according to Vnkatapuram, Bell and Marmot: “while health and human rights advocates have from the start taken a global perspective, social medicine and social epidemiology have been slower to catch up”."
2090,3,"TITLE: Turnstile politics: practices of care and mobility justice in Santiago’s public transport system | KEYWORDS: care; embodied practices; everyday mobilities; Mobility justice; public transport; turnstiles | ABSTRACT: Modern public transport systems are typically designed by following universal aspirations to predictability and standardisation. In the case of Santiago’s public transport, however, this design philosophy has often translated into concrete, practical struggles for users with more vulnerable corporealities. In analysing the case of a controversial turnstile installed in Santiago’s buses in 2016, this paper draws on video analysis to examine how passengers respond to, and locally deal with, its exclusionary design. Passengers’ interactions with this technology demonstrate how the turnstile is taken up as more than a mere sorting device, to become a matter of concern around mobility (in)justice. A detailed analysis of these interactions–through ethnomethodological analysis of video data–describes how passengers respond to the turnstile’s exclusionary design by deploying diverse embodied practices of care towards other users experiencing trouble with it. Such practices of care align with a grounded, embodied sense of mobility (in)justice as opposed to more abstract understandings of distributive justice. The paper concludes by discussing the potential forpublic transport systems to become more just and inclusive environments designed as infrastructures of care, whereby materialities may not only allow, but support, practices of care among users."
2091,3,"TITLE: Beyond fare evasion: the everyday moralities of non-payment and underpayment on public transport | KEYWORDS: Chile; fare evasion; morality; Public transport; social media; UK; video analysis | ABSTRACT: In attempting to understand and prevent fare evasion, existing research and policy have often categorised fare evaders based on passenger ‘types’ or profiles. However, such categorisations of ‘malicious’ or ‘virtuous’ behaviours rely on underlying moral claims which often go unexamined. In this paper, we study how different actors construct such moral claims as part of everyday interactions. We demonstrate that the everyday moralities of not or under-paying are diverse, locally occasioned, and emotionally charged. Drawing on social media and video data from Chile and the UK, we examine interactions between passengers, by-standers, transport workers, and transport operators. We highlight the diverse resources that actors draw upon to construct moral claims around fare evasion, including the mobilisation of alternative moral categories; attempts to produce exceptions to formal rules; and the foregrounding of moral emotions. The paper engages with an interdisciplinary body of work which reassesses existing policies and societal responses to fare evasion, while also contributing to a nascent literature on everyday morality and mobilities."

Our analysis uses a video recording of the event made by a passenger that circulated widely on social and news media. We document multiple forms of response, including the video-witnessing itself. We describe how the trouble-making passenger antagonizes other passengers in order to produce opponents. In addition, we track how members of the carriage, in responding, show their right to respond, seek to avoid the terms of the confrontation and, once constituted as political opponents, their opposition to the politics being expressed. In examining the responses to the trouble-making and the politics being contested between the persons involved and, in tracking how public transport is attempted to be transformed into an ad hoc agora, we contribute to Barnett’s work on convening public space, ordinary action, and politics in human geography."

Drawing upon a corpus of video recordings from dashcams, we show how drivers use the horn for creating awareness; how they target particular vehicles; and how they use it for warnings, for complaints, and in instructing the seeing of an aspect of an ambiguous traffic object. Drivers’ use of the horn involves, first, their sounding it in recognizable relations to past, current, and projected configurations of traffic on the road. Second, it involves drivers manipulating the vehicle horn to create sounds of shorter and longer durations that can then produce hearably distinct actions. Third, and finally, the driver can use the horn as an initiating or responsive action in relation to the actions of other members of traffic. The data are from road users in Chennai, India."

Current cancer therapies, notably chemotherapy, pose challenges due to their side effects. The early detection and management of the side effects are vital but complex. This study introduces a mobile health app designed to bridge the communication gaps between patients with cancer and health care providers. Hence, it allows patients to report symptoms immediately and also enables proactive symptom management by health care providers. Objective: This study has 2 objectives: first, to design a cancer-focused mobile health app that integrates educational content and real-time symptom reporting for chemotherapy patients. Second, to validate and evaluate the app quality using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). The app seeks to foster health care communication, reduce hospital readmissions, and optimize symptom management, contributing to a more impactful patient experience. Methods: This mixed-methods study details the development and validation of mobile health applications. The app was designed by a multidisciplinary team, including nurses, medical professionals, pharmaceutical chemists, computer engineers, and software developers, using agile methodologies. For validation, the app was assessed by 13 evaluators, including clinical professionals (nurses and physicians) and engineers. The evaluation included technical performance analysis using Google tools and quality assessment using the MARS, which measures engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. Results: Performance metrics highlighted areas for improvement, with loading times showing delays in displaying content. Meanwhile, the response time of the app was moderate, and visual stability remained excellent. The app achieved an overall MARS score of 3.75 (SD 0.42), indicating consistent quality, with functionality scoring the highest (4.35; SD 0.52) and engagement the lowest (3.31; SD 0.61). The reliability of the MARS was confirmed (interclass correlation coefficient: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72‐0.92). Evaluators unanimously praised the app’s potential benefits for patients and clinical professionals while identifying areas for improvement such as customization, onboarding guidance, and navigation. Conclusions: The CONTIGO app showed strengths in functionality, usability, and information quality, supported by robust security measures. However, areas such as user interactivity and engagement require improvement. Future refinements will integrate insights from patients with cancer to address user-specific needs and enhance the oncology care experience."

These disruptions early in life can be long-lasting. Although there is evidence about the effects of school closures on older children, there is scarce evidence on such losses for children in their early years. This article is among the first to quantify the actual impact of pandemic-related closures on early child development, in this case, for a sample of young children in Chile, where school and childcare closures lasted for about a year. We use a unique data set collected face-to-face in December 2020, which includes child development indicators for general development, language development, socioemotional development, and executive function. We find adverse impacts on children in 2020 compared to children interviewed in 2017 in most development areas. In particular, 9 months after the start of the pandemic, we find a loss in language development of 0.25 SD."

In this study, we examine the nature of associations between early childhood educators’ literacy content knowledge and their classroom emergent literacy practices. Specifically, we apply generalized additive modeling to consider three hypotheses regarding the functional form of these associations: (1) educators’ content knowledge must reach a threshold before demonstrating associations with practice, (2) educators’ knowledge is associated with practice until reaching a plateau, or (3) educators’ knowledge is linearly associated with practice. We measured educators’ (n = 437) content knowledge using an adaptation of the Moats (1994) knowledge survey, observed their classroom practices in the fall and spring of one academic year, and applied standardized coding schemes to code the latter with respect to the quality and quantity of emergent literacy practices. In general, results indicated positive, linear associations between educators’ knowledge and classroom practices. We discuss findings relative to prior work and conjectures concerning these associations as characterized by thresholds or plateaus. We also discuss implications for future research, preservice educator preparation, and inservice professional development."

Understanding how such anticipation comes about should ease its further development. We therefore explore the central capacity within anticipatory governance: the capacity to infer future consequences. Such inferential capacity consists of tools, techniques, and practices increasing an agent's options to infer consequences. We examine the development of this capacity for two Southeast Asian deltas, using data from a multi-sited ethnography and a social network analysis. These methods combine the small-scale ‘lived’ perspective of agents and the multiscale network in which these agents deploy strategies to entrench tools, techniques, and practices for inferential capacity. Strategic choices in positioning for network effects and fostering reciprocity matter, while values and historical contingencies cannot be brushed aside."
2098,16,"TITLE: How networked organisations build capacity for anticipatory governance in South East Asian deltas | KEYWORDS: Anticipatory governance; Capacity building; Environmental planning; Global networks; Modelling technologies; Project-based interactions | ABSTRACT: Building capacity for governments to make inferences about future developments enhances their ability to anticipate and plan for climate change adaptation. This study examines the question: how do networked organisations build capacity for anticipatory governance through project-based interactions? We analyse a global network of organisations that mobilise climate and hydrological modelling technologies into the Chao Phraya and Ayeyarwaddy deltas. The methodology innovatively combines ethnographic data with policy analysis and social network analysis. Findings suggest that organisations consolidate technology and knowledge transfer through a global network. However, their governance effect in enhancing anticipatory decision making is found to be marginal at the local level. We argue that anticipatory governance practices need a balancing of foresight tools and techniques with local institutional arrangements in order to be effective. We further demonstrate that technology transfer projects need to be backed up with social and strategic capacity building in order to nurture consistent anticipatory governance in different cultural contexts. We conclude that preventive actions, together with transparent operational response frameworks, could significantly improve resilience and adaptability of local knowledge systems and institutions dealing with climate change adaptation. Such integration could enable anticipatory response measures to better manage risk, as well as increase institutional cooperation for long term environmental planning."

The first mechanism identified is the establishment of environmental taxes that discourage contaminating behaviours from economic agents. The second mechanism is to incorporate tax exemptions that promote taxpayers to carry out specific actions that are deemed beneficial from an environmental standpoint. These mechanisms are conceptual categories that correlate to both the fixed source tax ruled in Article 8 of the 20.780 Act and the outlay specially ruled in Article 31 N°13 of the Income Tax Law, which are also analysed to determine if they comply with their environmental purposes."

The present study enquires into Educational Science university students’ attitudes towards people with disabilities analysing the differences that occur on the basis of the frequency of contact (almost permanent, habitual, frequent or sporadic), and the type of disability (motor, hearing, visual, intellectual or multiple) of the person with whom the contact is maintained. The participants were 900 students of the Faculty of Education of the University of Granada who completed the Scale of Attitudes towards people with disabilities. The analysis carried out shows significant differences depending on the contact with people with disabilities in different factors of the scale. In addition, there are more favourable attitudes in students who maintain sporadic contact, and also those in those with contact with people with sensory disabilities."

The dynamics of poor-quality employment in Chile, 2004–2019 | KEYWORDS: Alkire/Foster methods; Chile; Cumulative employment deprivations; Labor markets; Latin America; Longitudinal data; Multi-dimensional index | ABSTRACT: This paper studies whether workers become “stuck” in poor-quality employment, or whether poor-quality employment can serve as a “stepping stone” towards better job opportunities in the Chilean labor market. It does this from a multidimensional and longitudinal perspective, taking into account the intensity of the deprivation that workers face. In particular, it examines how workers move between good and bad jobs, and between these jobs, unemployment and inactivity and also discusses the respective determinants of these changes. The results of this analysis show that the deprivation levels among women in the labour market are persistently higher those of men, and that workers do indeed become stuck in bad jobs. Thus, the paper presents a methodology for measuring chronic deprivation in the labor market, an issue on which neither the literature on job quality nor the literature on poor-quality employment (or bad jobs) has focused. It concludes by discussing the policy implications of this research."
2111,19,"TITLE: Degrees of vulnerability to poverty: a low-income dynamics approach for Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Latin America; Longitudinal data; Middle class; Poverty dynamics; Vulnerability to poverty | ABSTRACT: I propose an empirical framework to identify different degrees of vulnerability to poverty using two vulnerability lines that classify currently non-poor people into risk groups: high, moderate and low risk of falling into poverty in the next period. The latter corresponds to the income secure middle class. My approach makes two contributions. First, it extends recent research that defines the middle class using a vulnerability threshold by introducing a new subdivision of the vulnerable group that would be useful in practice for public policy objectives. Second, it uses two models to predict both the probability of entering poverty and household income as part of the estimation procedures. The former controls for initial conditions effects and attrition bias, and the latter addresses the retransformation problem. I apply my approach to Chile using longitudinal data from the P-CASEN 2006–2009. The resulting vulnerability cut-offs (using the upper-middle-income country poverty line) are $20.0 per person per day for the low vulnerability line and $9.9 pppd for the high vulnerability line (both in 2011 PPP). My vulnerability lines differ significantly from those estimated in previous research on vulnerability and the middle class in Latin America. I argue that previous research has underestimated the size of the population at risk of falling into poverty and overestimated the growth of the middle class. Misclassifying the vulnerable as middle class limits their access to anti-poverty policies."

The dupilcate paragraph is shown below: “In the early 2000s, the economic literature that focuses on vulnerable groups developed a conceptual framework known as vulnerability-to-poverty (Hoddinott and Quisumbing 2010). This literature can be sorted into four groups: i) papers that emphasise the element of expected poverty, that is, that consider as vulnerability the probability of a household falling into poverty in a future period (e.g. Pritchett et al. (2000); Chaudhuri et al. (2002); ii) papers that stress the element of exposure to risk, for example, to indicate, retrospectively, whether an observed economic shock produced a loss of well-being in a household (e.g. Skoufas and Quisumbing (2005)); iii) papers that defne vulnerability as the diference between a household’s utility derived from certainty equivalent consumption and its expected utility derived from actual consumption (e.g. Ligon and Schechter (2003)); and iv) papers that identify vulnerable individuals according to the expected value and a risk parameter known as a mean-risk based approach (Chiwaula et al. 2011; Gallardo 2013). In the last decade, literature on vulnerability- to-poverty has continued developing around these four groups (e.g., Günther and Maier 2014; Klasen and Waibel 2015; Celidoni 2015; Hohberg et al. 2018), adding attempts to measure vulnerability from a multidimensional perspective (e.g., Feeny and McDonald 2016; Gallardo 2019) “ With this, the duplicate paragraph was removed from the orignal paper.The original article has been corrected."
2113,19,"TITLE: A Multidimensional Approach to Measuring Economic Insecurity: The Case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Economic insecurity; Global South; Multidimensional index; Survey of households finances; Well-being | ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a strategy to measure economic insecurity in countries in the Global South. It builds a 'Multidimensional Economic Insecurity Index' (MEII) that combines four indicators of economic vulnerability that cause stress and anxiety: unexpected economic shocks, unprotected employment or non-workers in the household, over-indebtedness and asset poverty. The index offers a measure that directly relates economic uncertainty to stress and anxiety due to the lack of protection and buffers to face an unexpected economic shock. The MEII is applied to Chile using Survey of Household Finances (SHF) cross-sectional data (2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017). The results show that (i) about half of the Chilean households experienced, on average, two or more economic vulnerabilities during the last decade with an intensity of 2.3 vulnerabilities, and (ii) economic insecurity affects households on the entire income distribution, even in the highest income deciles groups. By identifying the groups of households most affected by economic insecurity and its trend in recent years, applying the MEII in countries such as Chile provides relevant information to monitor, evaluate and improve social safety nets besides labour market regulations."
2114,6,"TITLE: Understanding changes in the geography of opportunity over time: The case of Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: Drivers of urban change; Geography of opportunity; Multidimensional indices; Municipal fiscal capacity; Urban attributes; Urban land market activity | ABSTRACT: The geography of opportunity research has made significant progress in recent years. The use of composite indexes aimed at capturing the attributes of different urban areas has been particularly useful to deepen the understanding of the role that the urban context plays in people's life chances. However, little attention has been paid to the dynamic component of the geography of opportunity, that is, what explains its changes over time and whether or not those changes (positive or negative) are substantial. The contribution of this work is that it offers a methodology (a conceptual framework, a composite geography of opportunity index and relative and absolute measures) that provides a holistic and in-depth approach to analyse not only the set of opportunities available in the different urban areas but also their change over time (how they change, the depth of those changes and the forces explaining it). The information generated through this approach has the advantage of better informing place-based policy interventions since it offers not only a clear classification of areas but also a useful method for comparing and monitoring the changes in the geography of opportunity over time."

The author disentangles, simultaneously, the roles of state dependence and heterogeneity (observed and non‐observed) in explaining income position persistence, such as poverty persistence and affluence persistence. The author applies the approach to Chile exploiting longitudinal data from the P‐CASEN 2006–2009. First, the author finds that income position mobility at the bottom and the top of the income distribution is much higher than expected, showing signs that income mobility in the case of Chile might be connected to economic insecurity. Second, the observable individual characteristics have a much stronger impact than true state dependence to explain individuals’ current income position in the income distribution extremes."
2116,19,"TITLE: The Political Economy of Unemployment Insurance based on Individual Savings Accounts: Lessons from Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: In recent years, unemployment protection systems based on individual savings have been instituted in several developing countries. Chile was one of the first to establish such a system, which at the time was widely cited as a model for other countries. This article discusses the particular political context in which the Chilean system was created before examining how it works in terms of coverage and levels of benefits received by unemployed workers. The authors undertake a detailed analysis of the administrative data produced by the system and conclude that the insurance covers only a small proportion of the unemployed, as most workers generally had precarious jobs that did not allow them to contribute to the system consistently. The Chilean case illustrates how difficult it is to establish functioning unemployment insurance in developing countries with precarious labour markets. Based on the interaction between employment characteristics and the conditions imposed by the benefit system, the article assesses the efficacy of the Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts (UISA) system and analyses whether it can indeed serve as a model for other developing countries."

Based on a broader mental health participatory action and qualitative research carried out in Catalonia (Spain) of 12 in-depth interviews and 3 focus groups, this article analyses the mother-caregivers’ experience in the domestic space. The results show that patients and caregivers are engaged in a relationship of “nested dependencies”, which create social isolation. This produces the conditions of “reactionary care”, practices that limit the autonomy of those affected and that reproduce forms of disciplinary psychiatric institutions. We conclude that both institutional violence derived from economic rationality and that which stems from the gender mandate feed off each other into the domestic sphere. This research argues for placing care at the center of clinical practice and shows the need to consider the structural forces shaping it."

Ten years ago, a judicial investigation revealed the location of a mass grave that led to the identification of detainees who had disappeared; eleven using genetic methods, along with another five recognized based on forensic archaeological evidence. Our main objective is to give an account of the consequences of the forced disappearance and concealment in three generations of relatives of disappeared detainees. Methods: A qualitative case study was conducted between 2014 and 2015, with a total of nineteen interviewees across three generations, belonging to six families in Paine. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, with two to three sessions per interviewee and three focus groups, one for each generation. Results: There are differences in the way the three generations deal with disappearance and attribute meaning to bone remains.Whereas in the first, generation the »duty to recognize« is prominent, in the second, what dominates is silence, and in the third, the processes of collective grief. In the experiences of intergenerational dialogue, spaces of memory have come to the fore. At last, one of the outstanding results of this investigation has been to give an account of the social experience of forensic identification. Conclusions: Forced disappearance and the operation of concealment straddle trans-generational effects, among which, voids of representation, silences, and the installation of doubt over the certainty of death stand out.The third generation questions the silences of their predecessors and creates the conditions for intergenerational dialogue, which is expressed particularly through collective commemoration rituals. Through DNA analysis, science offers the statistical evidence of forensic identification, but the decision remains in the individual jurisdiction of each family member."

2121,2,"TITLE: The collaborative management of antipsychotic medication and its obstacles: A qualitative study | KEYWORDS: Antipsychotic medication; Catalonia; Coercion; Collaborative management of medication; Concordance; Mental health; Qualitative research; Therapeutic alliance | ABSTRACT: Antipsychotic medication is the primary treatment for psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders; nevertheless, its administration is not free from conflicts. Despite taking their medication regularly, 25–50% of patients report no benefits or perceive this type of treatment as an imposition. Following in the footsteps of a previous initiative in Quebec (Canada), the Gestion Autonome de la Médication en Santé Mentale (GAM), this article ethnographically analyses the main obstacles to the collaborative management of antipsychotics in Catalonia (Spain) as a previous step for the implementation of this initiative in the Catalan mental healthcare network. We conducted in-depth interviews with patients (38), family caregivers (18) and mental health professionals (19), as well as ten focus groups, in two public mental health services, and patients' and caregivers' associations. Data were collected between February and December 2018. We detected three main obstacles to collaboration among participants. First, different understanding of the patient's distress, either as deriving from the symptoms of the disorder (professionals) or the adverse effects of the medication (patients). Second, differences in the definition of (un)awareness of the disorder. Whereas professionals associated disorder awareness with treatment compliance, caregivers understood it as synonymous with self-care, and among patients “awareness of suffering” emerged as a comprehensive category of a set of discomforts (i.e., symptoms, adverse effects of medication, previous admissions, stigma). Third, discordant expectations regarding clinical communication that can be condensed in the differences in meaning between the Spanish words “trato” and “tratamiento”, where the first denotes having a pleasant manner and agreement, and the second handling and management. We conclude that these three obstacles pave the way for coercive practices and promote patients' de-subjectivation, named here as the “total patient” effect. This study is the first GAM initiative in Europe."

The author discusses the concept of scale as a performative device that activates the capacities of bodies. Instead of seeing scale as a naturalised and hierarchical structure of spatial distribution, the author understands it as an ensemble of discourses and practices that produce scalar effects. Globalisation uses scale to promote the idea that subjects would become 'international' by being linked to privileged spaces and bodies in the Global North. In this sense, globalisation is not merely about nodes where certain flows converge. Rather, the author understands it as the political conditions that control and constrain the space for certain flows to occur and not others. Using assemblage analysis, the author presents and analyses three scenes taken from his ethnographic records that have as a guiding line the materialisation of the international. These scenes report the experience of being a Latin American doctoral student attending a congress in the United States, a tense situation experienced at a Chilean university academic event, and the unpretentious manifestation of an elaborate idea of internationality from a personal experience of a trip to India. The results point to three elaborations of the international: an optimistic view of a shared world, a geopolitical internationality and the production of a global corporeality."
2123,0,"TITLE: University, neoliberalism and hegemonic bodies: narratives of international students in Chile | KEYWORDS: gender relations; higher education; internationalization of education; Neoliberalism and education | ABSTRACT: This article investigates the production of neoliberal subjectivities in Latin American international students in Chilean universities. In last years, Chile have registered plenty political uprisings regarding its economic, social and gender inequalities. The premise is that Chile is a country where Neoliberalism is rooted not only in the form of political and economic guidelines, but as rationality. It proposes that these forms of thought-action reinforce typically male success stereotypes, dismissing bodies challenged of non-hegemonic paths. Narrative interviews with doctoral students in Chile are used to describe how the topic of academic excellence sustained by the Chilean neoliberal university market materializes differently in each body. Students report the interpellation of success discourses affecting their bodies and relating their nationhood, gender and sexualities experiences to feelings of diminishment, loneliness, discrimination, etc. I argue that the presence of neoliberal rationalities in the Chilean university favours the exercise of sexist practices, naturalized as market practices, and impose normative adjustments on the gender and sexuality performance of students."
2124,6,"TITLE: Walking as Political Utterance: The Walking Subjects and the Production of Space | KEYWORDS: Afro-Latin American researchers; intersectionality; Latin America; walking methodologies | ABSTRACT: In this work, we challenge supposedly neutral imaginaries of what walking methodologies consist of, unveiling social and political dimensions and addressing the production of embodied spaces involved in the act of walking. We adopt the concept of intersectionality to construct an analysis that considers the effects of the colonial, racist, and sexist historical scheme on the production of knowledge. We understand that the current globalization project produces a global subject that is not racialized, and therefore White. And it is marked by gender norms, and therefore, masculine and heterosexual. These characteristics give the person the privilege of moving “naturally,” without the need to justify physical, social, and political corporealities. In the walking research carried out by subjects who deviate from such global parameters, we identified the interruption of walking as an epistemological event that displaces them from the space they are producing. We also analyzed the idea of risk produced to the researchers when they are identified as someone who “does not belong” to that space. We argue that the interaction among gender, race, and place imposes a local condition to the knowledge produced by Afro-Latin American walking researchers. Finally, we defend the walking methodologies as a political statute in the occupation of simultaneously physical and epistemological spaces because the subject’s position and the power relations that are addressed in the act of walking require consideration."
2125,-1,"TITLE: Affective geopolitics: nation narratives from Colombian students in Chile | KEYWORDS: Affective geopolitics; gender migration; international education; Latin Americans; student mobility | ABSTRACT: Motivated by increasing Colombian immigration in Chile, this paper aims to understand the production of Colombian students attuned with the geopolitical discourses on immigrants in Santiago. Inspired by feminist geographers, it considers the nation as an affective device and geopolitics as the power asymmetries resulting from the encounter of different corporealities. Three cases are used to produce narratives about the affective geopolitics influencing Colombian doctoral students in Chile by analysing how their trajectories create unbalanced powers and affect how they live and re-signify their bodies and nationality. The results indicate that, by presenting themselves as Colombians, students are associated with stigmatised Colombian bodies, which include the notions that they are sexually reified, black, poor, and vulgar. At the same time, they try to dissolve the stereotype of the Colombian person in Chile and use their privileged positions as high-skilled graduate students to detach from the great Colombian immigrant flow."

In this study we use ethnographic knowledge produced in two Chilean schools where we conducted ethnographic fieldwork, in-depth interviews, and curriculum document analysis. Our purpose was to trace essentialist discourses about the nation, as a homogeneous and predictable space, and give meaning to the problematic naturalised correspondence between subjects and spaces. We use Foucauldian discourse analysis to understand the production of rationalities that support the production of the ‘Chilean student’ as distinct from other students from other countries within the same school contexts. We conclude with some highlights on the productive force of performativity when reproducing power relations around nation discourses."
2127,0,"TITLE: Student mobility and the production of Chile as an international academic hub | KEYWORDS: academic hubs; International academic mobility; international students; internationalisation of higher education; jumping scales; Latin America | ABSTRACT: In this paper, an analysis of the spatial production of Chile as an international academic destination for doctoral students is put forward. This arises from the notion of internationalisation as a process of the rescaling of university marketplaces and international students as consumers of global scales of excellence. As such, it proposes the concept of an international academic hub to understand how a space oriented towards a ‘global north’ is produced and articulated with the guidelines of economic globalisation. Four case studies of interviews with foreign doctoral students in Chile are used to explore narratives of the international in discourses about academic trajectories within the country. The results indicate that Chile is configured as a compensatory destination and that its internationalisation policies indicate a directionality towards globally legitimised destinations."

It uses as categories of analysis three geographic constructs that are particularly useful for studies about imaginaries of internationalization: globalization, limit/boundary and geographic scale. The results are presented and discussed gathering them in three different groups; an optimistic perspective on academic mobility, a critical perspective that denounces and demonstrates the contradictions of the process, and a postmodern approach that questions the fixed assumptions that operate in the understandings of students in motion. The author concludes that the scale statements promoted by discourses of international academic mobility act by producing asymmetric spaces in the geopolitics of global knowledge."

The investigation will be based on a critical geography approach and inspired on feminist geopolitics, where it is argued that there is a need to represent the border beyond the political frame that summons the reinforcement of the Nation-State, security, and the control of territory. The article explores the geopolitical narratives that emerge from dwelling, the social practices that spatialize the border, as their political materialization. For this study, the towns of Villa O’Higgins in Chile and El Chaltén in Argentina, will be considered as communities rooted at the edge of the national territories, where tourism redefines the spatial practices on the border zone."

On the Question of Co-belligerency | KEYWORDS: Co-belligerency; Humanitarian view; International armed conflict; International humanitarian law; Revisionism; Rule consequentialism | ABSTRACT: When does a state, by assisting one of the parties to an international armed conflict (IAC), become a party to it? Although the doctrinal answer to this question is somewhat unsettled, this chapter does not dispute or defend a specific doctrinal view. Instead, it explores the tension between philosophical accounts of the ethics of war and international humanitarian law (IHL), as it arises in the context of co-belligerency. After canvassing different doctrinal answers, the chapter discusses McMahan’s and similar revisionist views and to what extent they conflict with IHL’s positive answer to the question of co-belligerency. Then, the chapter argues that the ‘humanitarian view’ can partially solve this conflict, but it is still open to an important objection concerning IHL’s ability to reduce suffering, particularly in the long term. In order to dispel this objection in a morally attractive way, we have to concede that sometimes IHL reduces suffering at the expense of the rights of the innocent. This concession, the chapter argues, raises overarching concerns about IHL’s moral coherence and standing."
2133,-1,"TITLE: WAR AND COERCION | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Compelled service in hostile forces is prohibited by International Humanitarian Law. In the context of an international armed conflict, it is a war crime to compel prisoners of war (“POWs”) or other protected persons to serve in the forces of a hostile power and to compel participation in military operations against the person’s own country or forces. However, conscription—or compelled service in military forces—of a state’s own citizens is not prohibited under international law. In fact, conscription, some aspects of which are regulated by International Human Rights Law, is generally legitimate. This asymmetry—whereby compelling protected persons to fight or serve in the forces of a hostile power is a war crime, but compelling one’s own citizens is not—has puzzling implications. Take the example of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is a war crime for Ukraine to compel Russian POWs to fight on behalf of Ukraine, even though Ukraine is fighting a lawful war of self-defense. Yet, it is not a war crime for Russia to compel its own citizens to fight, even though Russia is fighting an unlawful war of aggression. Can we make moral sense of this asymmetric regime regarding compelled service in armed forces? Is the regime morally coherent? In order to make moral sense of the regime, two arguments must succeed. First, we must argue that it matters greatly whether individuals are compelled to fight in hostile forces or in the armed forces of their own state. Second, we must argue that the nature of the war they are compelled to serve in—whether the war is legal or illegal—does not matter at all. This Article argues that the second argument cannot but fail, but it is possible to argue that compelled service in hostile forces is morally wrong and often morally worse than compelled service in the armed forces of one’s own state. It is morally worse because it is morally worse to harm those who are vulnerable and defenseless, like those who have fallen into the hands of a party to the conflict. And it is morally wrong because noncitizens lack duties to fight on behalf of other states. However, what makes compelled service in hostile forces morally wrong also makes conscription morally wrong. That is, what is wrong about compelled service in hostile forces is also present in the state’s conscription of its own citizens. This Article thus argues that the current regime concerning compelled service in armed forces is, in fact, morally incoherent. To render the regime morally coherent, international law should (1) appropriately distinguish between conscription to serve in legal wars and conscription to serve in illegal wars, and (2) generally prohibit compelled service in armed forces."
2134,1,"TITLE: Gender and the legal academy | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This Foreword examines what we describe as a “gender gap” in the legal academy. The gap can be seen most clearly in the significantly lower proportion of tenured women faculty members than of men faculty members in most parts of the world, but it is evident in many other aspects too, including the fact that women in academia are often clustered in a “pink ghetto” with lower pay, status, and job security. We begin by outlining the nature of the academic gender gap and some of the obstacles to its removal or reduction, before considering the reasons this gap should be a matter for concern. Two kinds of reasons for such concern are offered: consequences-based and justice-based. The Foreword concludes by suggesting a number of ways in which the gender gap might be addressed, arguing for attention to be paid to the risk of pursuing apparent solutions which may have the effect of entrenching or exacerbating aspects of the problem. Ultimately, we argue that what is needed is not just a larger proportion of women in law schools, but a more just and feminist legal academy along multiple intersecting dimensions."
2135,10,"TITLE: The Morality of the Laws of War: War, Law, and Murder | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Combatants are equal under the laws of armed conflict, regardless of whether the wars they fight are just or unjust, legal or illegal. They are permissible targets and can kill each other in battle. This basic feature of international law has been recently put into question by a group of moral philosophers known as revisionists, who argue that just combatants in an unjust war should be considered innocents, and their deaths considered murder. Dr. Prieto Rudolphy explains and assesses the conflict between the revisionist argument and the existing legal norms in The Morality of the Laws of War: War, Law, and Murder. The book provides an in-depth assessment of modern ethical thought on killing in wartime, deconstructing the revisionist view of war and offering a new perspective on the legal equality of combatants. Prieto Rudolphy not only examines the tension between the revisionist morality and the traditional thesis of symmetry between combatants but proposes a contingent justification of the latter and an alternative morality of war. Underlying both is the inescapable fact that regulating war is always a moral compromise. At the same time, she argues that there is urgent moral pressure to improve our laws - to bring them closer to an ideal whereby war does not exist. The Morality of the Laws of War is a must-read for scholars of moral philosophy and international law, from students to experts, providing a thorough account of contemporary debates on the ethics of warfare and using nuanced arguments to illuminate a fresh perspective."

2137,25,"TITLE: Populism's Antagonism to International Law: Lessons from Latin America | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: International legal scholarship often assumes that populists will have an antagonistic relationship with international law.1 But a view from Latin America, where populism has been an object of study since the early twentieth century, tells a more complex story: populist leaders have engaged in multilateralism, promoted regional unity, and attempted to create international institutions. And populists as well as non-populists have resisted international institutions. This essay questions the assumption that populists have an antagonistic relationship with international law, and argues that this assumption lacks robust empirical support and is theoretically underdeveloped. Latin America is a particularly significant site for challenging this assumption, given the prominent role of the executive in foreign relations2 and the rich intellectual history regarding populism itself. The essay concludes by stressing the need for developing a theoretical framework for the study of populism and international law, which international legal scholarship currently lacks. Such a framework should be less Euro-centric and less normatively biased: it should not assume that resistance to international law is always without merit. And it should also allow us to identify what is distinctively populist about populism's relation with international law and which aspects are mediated by populism's host ideologies."
2138,1,"TITLE: Between predictability and perplexity | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This article focuses on the relationship between academia, the gendered division of labor, and the pandemic. After briefly canvassing preliminary research about the effects of the pandemic on academic women, it discusses the gendered division of caregiving responsibilities, both inside the family and in academic institutions. Through the lens of feminist theory, the article aims to understand what can be perceived as a kind of paradox or contradiction: on the one hand, there is something deeply predictable about the fact that women have shouldered relatively disproportionate caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic. On the other hand, and because these gendered effects are so predictable, there is something somewhat perplexing in the lack of institutional response. This article explains what is predictable about the phenomenon as an instantiation of misogyny and the gendered division of labor - a reproduction of already existing issues. The somewhat perplexing nature of the phenomenon comes from the lack of institutional response to deeply predictable effects, but it is also related to how resilient the gendered nature of caregiving obligations has proven to be, even during the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic. This resilience, the article suggests, might be explained by the intersection of misogyny and economic exploitation."

It argues that there are two strands in Stopler's arguments. The first is Stopler's critique of Political Liberalism for its accommodation of ""right-wing populism.""This article argues that ""right-wing populism""is not a ""reasonable comprehensive view""under Rawls's theory. Thus, Political Liberalism does not accommodate this view; it excludes it from the possibility of a reasonable overlapping consensus. The second strand in Stopler's article can be interpreted as an invitation to think about the value of idealization in political theory. More concretely, this article argues that Stopler's claims can be read as suggesting that political liberalism's flaw is not that it tolerates illiberal views, but that it tells us little about how to achieve and maintain an overlapping consensus about justice in the kind of societies we actually inhabit. This article briefly argues that this critique deserves attention, especially given the circumstances of today's societies, where extreme views are not uncommon and the effects of climate change threaten the very possibility of justice."

2142,25,"TITLE: Populist governments and international law: A reply to Heike Krieger | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: In this article, I argue that there are two main objections against Heike Krieger's view on what 'a populist approach to international law' entails. First, there are two methodological obstacles that counsel against constructing 'a populist approach to international law': populism varies significantly depending on its definition of 'the people' and international law is a fragmented regime. Second, the opposition between a 'law of coordination' and a 'law of cooperation' to which Krieger resorts is misleading, for it obscures the fact that the value of cooperation and coordination lies primarily in the values for which we coordinate and cooperate. As such, I argue that this opposition may make us partially blind to two important dangers that some forms of populism may pose right now: their cooperating to reshape international law and institutions according to (some) of their values and their refusing to cooperate or coordinate in the achievement of urgent goals. Nonetheless, I conclude that the precise shape of these dangers - as well as how to resist them - remains blurry if we do not pay proper attention to the ways in which different forms of populism define 'the people'."

The first is the model of the impact of educational research on teaching practice. The second is the creation of an index that measures the impact of educational research on teaching practice, using structural equation modeling. This study looked at a sample of 179 individuals, of which 62 were university teachers and 117 were non-‐university teachers. Through a secondary analysis of the data, the different stages of construct validity were developed and structural equation modeling, obtaining a model covered by three constructs represented by 15 items. The model showed that the perception of the diagnosis of the impact of educational research on the practice of teachers directly explained the understanding of the impact phenomenon. The impact index EI-‐PD was 60.23%, showing that teachers do not substantially consider the contribution of educational research on teaching practice."

For this, we designed a relatively complex survey, including information about the current mode, preferences of respondents, indicators of perception, habits, and a question about their willingness to change mode. We used a sample of 805 individuals to estimate a hybrid ordinal logit model. This model included individuals’ socio-demographic variables, characteristics of the built environment, and the trip, as well as three latent constructs: spontaneity towards changing mode of transport; perception of risk regarding bicycle use; and availability of cycling-related facilities when using bicycles. The model confirms previous expectations; for example, the willingness to change to cycling diminishes with the length of the trip and with the age of the individual; also, people more habituated to their current mode are less willing to change it. In terms of public policy, the model provides several insights regarding incentives for using bicycles, including the need for structural changes to diminish the latent perception of insecurity held by less experienced cyclists."

This article shows results of the application of a stated preferences survey in the city of Ocaña, Colombia, to identify factors that influence the modal choice, introducing the bicycle as an alternative for the trips to and from the University Francisco de Paula Santander Ocaña, using discrete choice models. These results show that the infrastructure availability is a key variable for modal shift and that giving incentives such as meals do not influence modal choice. These results were shared with the local authorities as an argument towards cycle lanes investment and public transportation grants for students."

I used autoethnography as a research method to explore significant moments in my life during the years of both my primary and secondary education. The cumulative power of these life vignettes have been researched to understand the diverse emotional, complex and multilayered experiences of my formative years of childhood and how such emotions may have shaped my career choices and who I am at this very moment. This paper meticulously collected artifacts such as personal photos, newspapers, transcribed recordings of moments of intense emotions and memories as sources of data that supported a journey of growth. These data were analysed using thematic analysis and compared with my own written recollections, together with visual representations of emotions found in photographs of my life journey. Findings of this study revealed a journey of “self” that has explored and documented an understanding of the motivations of myself as a teacher-researcher to become the person I am. Today, my intrinsic interest in emotional intelligence area of research motivated me to explore the genesis of my own experiences and successes. In this autoethnography I become a learner, analysing my life data searching for themes such as self-awareness, perseverance, resilience, empathy, motivation and social skills, all found in the repertoire of a person’s emotional intelligence."

The research was conducted across core units in first and fourth years of an undergraduate education degree in an Australian university. The researchers used a mixed method study. Online survey data from 208 students were analysed, using descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic analysis for open-ended responses. Results indicate that PSTs' understandings of EI included awareness and management of emotions in oneself and others. They perceived EI as highly important to teachers in various aspects of teaching such as classroom management, student well-being and classroom pedagogy. Additionally, first year students stated that they expected to learn about EI in their teacher education program, however fourth year students expressed that they had not learnt about EI during their course."

In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM), lean principles and sustainability concerns have emerged as trends in the industry, since they aim to improve how buildings are delivered throughout their entire lifecycle. Value aggregation and efficiency in operational and environmental terms are major concerns by stakeholders and wider society. Integrating these practices would yield better project outcomes. However, majority of studies are focused on these elements in isolation or in pairs and there are no comprehensive frameworks suggesting an integration. This study researched, analysed and articulated existing work on a possible integration framework of BIM, lean and sustainability principles (BLS) to promote performance improvements. Current proposals were analysed along with drivers, benefits, barriers and challenges for integration. Academics and industry practitioners will benefit from this framework as it looks into future requirements of the industry, which is aiming to achieve better efficiency and enhancement of sustainability outcomes."

Retention has assumed technical relevance in studies of quality in education, at the same time that it increases its importance in international rankings and in the accreditation processes of university institutions. According to a World Bank study (Ferreyra et al., 2017) HE in the region is characterized by: 1) an average completion rate of 46%, with important differences between one country and another; 2) the existence of an exponential increase in enrollment, doubling its regular rate; 3) the incorporation of “new students”, previously underrepresented in the HE. Taking into account that in the region there is a lack of predictive research on the phenomenon of retention (Munizaga, Cifuentes & Beltrán, 2018), this study aims to review recent information regarding retention in LAC, in order to reach an agreed definition about the phenomenon, with the intention of broadening the discussion on how to guarantee the retention of students in a context of equitable and inclusive HE (Espinoza, González & Latorre, 2009). All in all, this work seeks to answer what are the individual, sociodemographic and institutional variables associated with the retention of first-year students of the Programa Académico de Bachillerato of the University of Chile? Through a binary logistic regression model, composed of eight variables, the following six significant variables were identified: ethnic origin of the students, approval of all credits and gratuity, with a positive relationship with retention. On the other hand, the preference, gender and score of the university selection test, reach a negative association with retention. The main recommendations of this study are, at the institutional level, to offer broader academic trajectories and, at the state level, to assume responsibilities regarding the financing of students."

Despite the importance it has acquired over the last few years, there is still no bibliographical review of a systematic and replicable methodology that allows us to understand the main results and conclusions of the various investigations within the region. For this reason, the present study aimed to describe variables and factors that have been associated with student retention and dropout in Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean. We found and analyzed 81 articles in Spanish and Portuguese published between 1990 and 2016, distributed in 10 countries and indexed in seven databases. A protocol applied by two independent researchers was used to organize the information. A total of 111 different variables associated with the phenomenon were found. These were grouped into the five factors proposed by the ALFA-GUIA Project: “Individual”, “Academic”, “Economic”, “Institutional” and “Cultural”. Among the factors, the one that predominates is the “Individual”, which makes it necessary to improve the measurement of latent variables and the adaptation of instruments. The presence of the factors “Academic” and “Institutional” demand changes at the level of Higher Education Institutions attending the new students who enter. Finally, the “Economic” factor demands to ensure the financing of the studies. Along with the above, much of the research focuses on the characterization of students and very few analyze the result of interventions to reduce dropout. There is also an important discordance when defining and measuring this phenomenon. That is why it is necessary to establish common parameters for the central concept and its measurement, in addition to redefining ALFA-GUIA factors specifically the “Individual”, “Academic” and “Cultural”."

This study determined the morphodynamic state of 54 sandy biogenic beaches on the northeast coast of Cuba. This was done based on the identification of coastal geoforms found in land works between August 2018 and March 2022 and the geoforms identified in high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth Pro (CNES/Airbus, Maxar Technologies). In addition, on 12 representative beaches on the northeast coast, we explored whether the coastal geoforms indicative of certain morphological states observed during fieldwork match those predicted by the Ω dimensionless parameter or Dean’s index, which classified beaches as dissipative, reflective, and intermediate. The main geomorphological features include an average beach width of more than 50 m, an 11 m-wide face, and a narrow or absent flat zone with a mean height of 1.35 m, lacking cusps and rhythmic topography, except for 26 % of beaches and only in winter. The submerged zone shows a low sand bar without rip currents. Coral reefs that protect the beaches from the highest waves in 93 % of the cases represent the distinctive geomorphological feature of the beaches studied. The dimensionless parameter confirmed that the beaches of Cuba’s northeast coast correspond to intermediate morphodynamic states with a trend toward reflective rather than dissipative modal states. These findings correspond to the coastal geoforms and sediment granulometry on the beaches studied. The figures obtained with the dimensionless parameter Ω and the sedimentary characteristics of the beaches are consistent with the characteristics of intermediate beaches reported by Australian researchers, but we did not find the geoforms for intermediate beaches reported by them. The beaches studied showed no rip currents, chains of coastal furrows, low-tide terraces, marked rhythmic topography, and cusps. Other studies have also pointed out that the beach classification proposed by Australian researchers, which considers the characteristics of waves and the sedimentation rate, is not always applicable. In the study area, this is mainly due to the presence of coral reefs close to the coast, low wave energy, and the influence of geological factors, in addition to the prevalence of longitudinal over transverse sand transport. Our results confirm that beach classification considering their morphodynamic state is essential to understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of the hydrodynamic processes on beaches and contributes to a better local and regional knowledge of them. In addition, they highlight that the hydrodynamic and sedimentary characteristics of each coastline should be studied before using beach equilibrium profile models and the equations derived from them for erosion control actions."

An a/r/tographic approach (which brings together the roles of artist, teacher and researcher in an inquiry) contributes to visualizing these affirmations by drawing on the artistic reflections and practices displayed and occurring within the workshop work. The aesthetic exercise is fundamental for directing and proposing three experiences in three educational contexts; two of them are developed in the Caja Granada Museum and invite the general public and primary education teachers to interact with works of the collection while the third is deployed within the scope of professional training in Artistic Education of a group of Social Education students from the University of Granada. These are simple graphic actions that value the individual result and relate it to the rest of the participants, collectively constructing a work in interaction with its place of development. The results achieved contribute finally to the crystallization of a proposal that gathers eight criteria as basic ideas for the teaching and practice of engraving applicable to other possible educational contexts."

In this sense, AI offers diverse solutions as work support, according to the different support needs in the educational context and the emerging needs of students, as well as social and technological changes. The research describes an active methodology activity, with the implementation of an AI tool based on Augmented Reality (AR), developed in the classroom for the subject ""Notions of Economics"" of the Law degree at the Technological University Metropolitan (UTEM). Using a quantitative methodology, the students' perception of the use of applied technologies in education was evaluated. After the learning experience, the students evaluated the activity. The results show that learning based on AI tools turned out to be valuable in activating participation, interactivity and facilitating a deeper and more practical understanding of the subject. In this way, the role of the students was highlighted during the development of the teaching activity and, simultaneously, it allowed one of the hallmarks of the institution to be put into practice, which is technology, and at the same time it is one of the characteristics of the graduation profile of the Law degree."

Reflections on the European system ¿ACCIÓN RECONVENCIONAL O EXCEPCIÓN? LA DEFENSA DEL TERCERO DEMANDADO ANTE EL NO USO DE LA MARCA COMERCIAL EN EL DERECHO CHILENO. REFLEXIONES EN TORNO AL SISTEMA EUROPEO | KEYWORDS: Caducidad; counterclaim; demanda reconvencional; Expiration; trademark use; uso de marca comercial | ABSTRACT: The objective of this work is to analyze, in the chilean trademark system, the possibility that a third party defendant in a litigation - where an alleged trademark violation, nullity, or in the opposition process is discussed - can request by way of exception, the declaration of expiration of the right over the trademark, for not being used by its owner during a period of five years. The above, since in Chile the current Industrial Property Law N° 19.039, in article 27, recognizes the institution of expiration due to lack of use of the trademark; however, section C of that rule only legitimizes the third party sued by the trademark owner to exercise said action in its defense through counterclaim. Our thesis concludes that, in some cases, it is more advantageous for the third party defendant –from a procedural perspective– to declare the revocation action as an exception in its defense and not through counterclaims. To do this, this study is based on the comparative law method where I will analyze the different criteria outlined from the european level regarding the topic and the regulatory changes produced in the last reform of 2022 in Chile."

The ethical-epistemic and socio-epistemic framework provided by these injustices is linked to themes that cross the main philosophical traditions such as pragmatism, phenomenology, and critical theory. These injustices are further intertwined with social and intellectual movements such as feminism, critical race theory, critical disability studies, and decolonizing epistemologies. However, there is a question that people with disabilities have not been sufficiently addressed. This article is positioned in the current debates on epistemic injustices and disability, and its purpose is to contribute the concept of “normalized epistemic injustices”. Starting from the verification of the ways in which subjects with disabilities are oppressively recognized, as far from the “norm”, it establishes that there are epistemic injustices associated with this identification. It proposes that normalized epistemic injustices occur at the intersection of two realms: a capacitist hermeneutic system and a constrained epistemic agency where at least three types of configurations are produced: non-agency; diminished epistemic agencies and epistemic agencies in resistance. Thinking about epistemic injustices considering the weight of “normality” in the constitution as subjects of people with disabilities allows us to recognize a critical situation of epistemic exclusion for some people, while others resist and fight to be understood in collective hermeneutical resources."

These studies focus on a series of theoretical developments that privilege cultural, discursive, and relational understandings of disability, connecting the aspirations of people with disabilities with the agendas of feminist, queer, postcolonial, poststructuralism and posthuman studies. This work aims to outline the epistemological contributions of these studies through the identification of theoretical axes that have been consolidated: power, production of bodies and internalized oppression; intersectionality and multiple identities; and posthuman assemblages. The contribution of these axes lies on the one hand, in the departure from the disability-impediment binary characteristic of the more conventional social studies of disability, which allows us to understand the variability of experiences of disability, and, on the other hand, it makes disability concept strategic to explain the ways in which subjects are produced in current societies."

However, this type of format has the potential to limit broader student participation. This study aims to compare learning assessment data between a traditional NSF REU (10 weeks of summer, full-time, in-person) to an alternative NSF REU delivered virtually, part-time and over 10 months as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: A retrospective pre-then-post survey was completed to assess perceived learning gains for each REU program. Three learning gains categories were assessed: entrepreneurial competencies, career goals and research skill development. T-tests were used to evaluate a difference in means between pre and post. Findings: Findings show the greatest quantity of learning gains within the alternative program delivery. Moreover, a larger quantity of learning gains was perceived within the first semester of the alternative program delivery compared to the second semester. Practical implications: The authors propose the NSF should be intentional about trying new approaches to REU programs delivery, including duration and format, as a way to broaden participation in engineering. Originality/value: This study is original in that it is the first of its kind to assess an alternative REU program delivery (allowed only because of the COVID-19 pandemic) in comparison to traditional REU program delivery."

A series of experimental tests were carried out in order to calculate the U-value of active insulated windows using the Heat Flux Meter method (ISO 9869-1); this to compare the insulation properties of traditional single glass, double glazing with different aerogel fillings and vacuum glazing windows. The use of this heat flux method utilised an environmental chamber to provide a temperature difference of 15 °C reporting the U-values as follows: traditional double glazing 3.09 W/m2·K, vacuum glazing 1.12 W/m2·K, and double glazing with aerogel pillars 2.52 W/m2·K. On the other hand, double glazing with KGM wheat starch reported 3.40 W/m2·K, double glazing with granulated aerogel 2.07 W/m2·K and heat insulation solar glass 1.84 W/m2·K. Vacuum glazing recorded optimal results under these experimental conditions, describing a U-value 78 % lower when compared to traditional single glazing window units (5.15 W/m2·K). Installation of windows with lower thermal transmittance are expected to increase in the global market to meet the current construction codes, aimed for achieving net zero carbon buildings."

This paper experimentally investigates the feasibility of a novel blister PCM panel for ceiling tile applications. Experimental panels enhance the thermal conductivity of the PCM with the addition of steel and aluminium wool particles at 3.77 wt.% and 23 wt.%, respectively. During the experimental procedure, the blister panels where able to absorb the heat coming from the environmental chamber, proving that the encapsulation material was able to promote the heat exchange. Furthermore, the PCM enhancement indicates that both the aluminium and steel wool particles improved the blister panel thermal performance. These results were confirmed by thermal conductive, calculated at 0.733 W/(m K) for the base panel, 0.739 W/(m K) for the aluminium wool, and 0.784 W/W/(m K) for the steel wool. The experiment suggest that the application of PCM blister ceiling tiles can be considered as an innovative method for thermal performance control and energy saving."

The integration of phase change materials (PCMs) as latent thermal energy is a popular method to incorporate them into the building envelope, reducing the energy demand and helping maintain the thermal comfort. In this experimental evaluation, the application of S23 ceiling panels to enhance the building performance is investigated. To analyse the PCM panels, a test room was artificially heated securing the melting temperature for the material; the results show that the S23 panels were able to absorb and increase the room temperature by 5 °C. During the cooling period, the PCM ceiling tiles help maintain higher room temperatures, up to +1.5 °C. The S23 panel temperature was able to drop below its melting point after 6 hours of cooling, demonstrating its capacity to complete the thermal cycle. The panel thermal conductivity range was found between 0.19-0.24 W/(m K). It can be concluded that the addition of the S23 ceiling panels can be considered as an innovative solution for the application of passive TES in building envelopes, leading to energy savings by absorbing, storing and helping maintaining the ambient room temperature, therefore reducing the requirement for artificial heating and cooling."

This article presents the results of a group video feedback program on early childhood teachers in public centers. The model, which focuses on promoting “educational sensitivity”, comprises 5 group sessions. A pre-post evaluation of 157 participants was conducted by coding dyad and group interaction videos. After the intervention, a significant increase relative to the baseline was found in measures of dyad (d = 0.67) and group sensitivity (d = 0.13), among other positive outcomes. Likewise, a significant association was found between variables of dyadic sensitivity and group sensitivity, concurrently and prospectively. The promising results obtained support the viability of the model in early education. Future studies should include a control group and randomization measures to strengthen these conclusions and incorporate a follow-up component to evaluate the program’s long-term impact on educators."

In this regard, we have investigated the agreement between mothers and educational staff of Chilean preschoolers regarding scores on behavioral problems in children. Mothers (n = 162) and educational staff (n = 42) assessed each child (n = 162, 36 to 49 months) through the ""Inventario de Problemas Conductuales y Socio-emocionales"", IPCS. The agreement between mothers and teachers was analyzed through mean scores and t-tests. The mean scores rated by mothers were significantly higher than those of educational staff, the scores from the maternal perspective correspond to the level of risk or behavioral problems, in contrast to the perception of the educational staff whose mean falls under the category of normal."

It puts forward an alternative reading of the people’s claim for a new constitution. The first section briefly describes the October outcry and provides some context with regards to the nature of the social movement at its root. The two following sections examine two periods in Chilean recent history, the Pinochet regime and the period that has come after its overturn, focusing on two elements: the neoliberal model set up by the dictatorship and the Constitution of 1980, which was designed to block the people’s political agency for the purpose of protecting the model. The final section works with these two elements in order to provide an alternative scheme by which to examine Chile’s awakening, the central question being: what does the claim for a new constitution mean? And critical for these purposes: what constitution is being overturned? Pinochet’s political project distorted constitutional ideas in such a way that only by clarifying the conceptual horizon is it possible to visualize how the concept of constitution and its relationship with the idea of a constituent power of the people can be of help to understand Chile’s constitutional awakening."

Four ways of characterising the notion are described, relying, where relevant, on the input obtained beyond the legal field - especially in that of philosophy. Although each of them accounts for a different kind of human property, an important commonality among them is stressed, which provides a pathway to understand the place of dignity as a constitutional end within a material approach to constitutions."

Dimensions that are not only present in what could be interpreted as a theoretical wink, but also in the practices -visual, oral, written- with which Lemebel seems to overflow and enrich his philosophical origin. If, in general, within the multiple recreations of becoming that are promoted in his chronicles, Lemebel tends to question the symbolic universe of the new man, the text that consecrates Subcomandante Marcos seems to introduce unusual forms of subversion that question and at the same time confront the local revolutionary imaginary. However, it is not only a matter of destabilizing the binarized discourses of the revolution, but also of making visible other possible forms of disrespect and resistance. And that is what seems to be re-created in the memoirs that, in the context of the Chilean revolt of 2019, have taken Lemebel's name from the line of flight to the front line of fire."

To review its effects, 30 companies attached to the Selective Stock Price Index in Chile were studied, identifying the accounting policies applied, as well as the effect produced on the accounting items on the date of adoption. The effect on several financial indicators was also analyzed. The methodology implies a quantitative and descriptive approach and a cross – sectional study and a review of the financial statements and their respective notes. As a conclusion, it is obtained that the companies, in general, used the modified retrospective accounting policy, with a lower proportion of them affecting the accumulated profits compared to those that chose to equal assets to liabilities, not modifying equity. In addition, the evidence shows that the indicators are affected by the level of use of operating lease contracts. The convergence process was favored over the comparability between accounting items, consistent with previous estimates that suggested that there should be practical solutions that facilitate the application of the standard, for a better quality and usefulness of the information."

The low-rank nature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of fine-tuned models, however, thus potentially compromising performance on complex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between LoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of trainable parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this question by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs full-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank, non-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable parameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to the fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank limitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training. Through extensive experimentation across vision, language, and vision-language benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing random basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial across vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for vision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces-and sometimes eliminates-the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA, demonstrating its efficacy."

Various architectures, from vision transformers (ViTs) to convolutional networks (ResNets) have been trained with CLIP to serve as general solutions to diverse vision tasks. This paper explores the differences across various CLIP-trained vision backbones. Despite using the same data and training objective, we find that these architectures have notably different representations, different classification performances across datasets, and different robustness properties to certain types of image perturbations. Our findings indicate a remarkable possible synergy across backbones by leveraging their respective strengths. In principle, classification accuracy could be improved by over 40 percent with an informed selection of the optimal backbone per test example. Using this insight, we develop a straightforward yet powerful approach to adaptively ensemble multiple backbones. The approach uses as few as one labeled example per class to tune the adaptive combination of backbones. On a large collection of datasets, the method achieves a remarkable increase in accuracy of up to 39.1% over the best single backbone, well beyond traditional ensembles."

However, decision-making itself is not usually considered curriculum content. Recently, the Chilean school mathematics curriculum incorporated decision-making in contexts of uncertainty as a teaching object in differentiated secondary education. Objective: Discuss from a socioepistemological perspective how the teaching of decision-making in uncertainty is proposed in the Chilean curriculum, considering both the study programme and the official school text. Design: Based on a qualitative methodology, thematic analysis is used to identify historical-epistemological criteria and content analysis to review the activities of the curriculum texts. Setting and participants: Three textual corpora are analysed: a historical work, the syllabus, and the official school text. Data collection and analysis: By applying interpretative content analysis, the activities proposed for teaching decision-making in contexts of uncertainty are analysed, considering as a criterion the epistemological distinction between single-case decisions and decision-making processes, as well as the use of a priori and a posteriori probabilities. Results: The textbook provides more tasks or questions involving the student in decision-making than the syllabus, but not always explicitly, emphasizing calculation and formulas. Based on the defined analysis criteria, it was possible to classify all the activities except one related to the Monty Hall problem. Conclusions: The activities proposed in both the textbook and the syllabus almost exclusively promote single-case decisions, with a predominance of a posteriori probabilites, which generates a conceptual overlap between chance and randomness."

The methodological approach is mixed, using a case study, by applying implicative statistics. A group of students enrolled in the mathematics pedagogy degree of a Chilean university answered a questionnaire that included three questions. The results indicate that students, in general, show a mastery of mathematical procedures associated with fundamental concepts of a vector space. There is an affinity between the solution set of a homogeneous linear equation, with two and three variables, and some fundamental concepts of a vector space such as generator set, scalar weighting, and vector subspace, with reference to geometric aspects. It is concluded that the homogeneous linear equation is an algebraic resource that allows examining mathematical procedures to activate the construction-action of concepts."

The results of the disciplinary knowledge test were analyzed, and contrasted with temporal, institutional, territorial, and socio-educational variables. The results show that, if it is assumed that this evaluation measures what it intends to measure, regardless of the variable analyzed, a significant proportion of those who will become teachers have lower didactic and disciplinary knowledge. This would generate a scenario in which teachers enter the system with a “debt” of knowledge, under the dominant institutional logics. This may generate negative consequences in terms of the identity of teachers in training, training institutions, and practicing teachers, opening the way to a questioning of the instrument and its application."

The theoretical dimension and the practical dimension of both mathematical content knowledge (MCK) and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge (MPCK) were analysed. Data were collected and analysed following a mixed approach. The results of the study reveal the effectiveness of the system in the theoretical dimension and the difficulties that arise in classroom practices. The critical role of the specialized components of MPCK in the theory-practice articulation is discussed.

Twenty-two students enrolled in a mathematics teaching degree and in a master's degree in didactics of mathematics are surveyed through the application of a questionnaire using a mixed methodology approach. The results show that the students surveyed use both the logarithm operator and the exponential function in parallel. The results underscore the roles played by graphs and the use of patterns and the power operation to establish restrictions at the base of the exponential relationship. In addition, the results confirm the role played by recursive multiplication of a positive real number to highlight the monotony of the exponential function. It is concluded that these results validate the proposed model of genetic decomposition, vindicating the theoretical elements that support it."

From a lear ning situation, consisting of deciding between two random games with dices, the relationship between proportional thinking and probabilistic thinking is studied, considering three states for proportional thinking and three types of probabilistic thinking. Under the focus of an instrumental case study, the decisions and arguments of Chilean high school students are analyzed. The results indicate that there are both beneficial and harmful relationships between proportional and probabilistic thinking, and that the difficulties in determining probabilities are not necessarily due to the absence of the use of proportions. A teaching that considers argumentation and learning of the sample space is recommended to channel the use of intuitive resources."

Therefore, the purpose of this research is to characterize the difficulties that arise when students from high school address a real-world problem in the field of visual perception. The method used corresponds to didactic engineering, which is done by confronting historical-epistemological research on Euclid's Optics and the students' answers when dealing with a problem that is designed on the basis of such study. The results revealed difficulties, both in the tendency that students show when justifying their answers about the studied phenomenon and the restrictions caused by the approach of the angle inscribed theorem."

Thus, the purpose of this research is to characterize the knowledge in use in the measurement of inaccessible distances in Johann Stöffler's Elucidatio Fabricoe Ususque Astrolabii, published in 1513. The theoretical model used considers the study of the constitution of knowledge through the analysis of its genesis, development and transversality. The results reveal in the analyzed work an episteme of the measurement of inaccessible distances that includes both the search for a suitable reason to carry out the measurement and the dynamic analysis of the behavior of the shadows or the visual rays in the estimation of inclinations. This episteme is critical for the understanding of this mathematical knowledge in problem solving."

This paper aims to analyze agribusiness’s readjustment strategies to face the socio-ecological impacts of the Capitalocene. For this purpose, our guiding questions are: How is agribusiness reading the current socio-ecological crisis, and what strategies are its main actors proposing? The main strategies in progress are technical innovations in productive systems, the increasing scale of infrastructure, displacement toward the south of the country, and renewed narratives. This contributes to legitimizing the current agricultural model without questioning its principles, while becoming more profitable and adaptable to the Capitalocene era."

Mixed research methods were used, combining qualitative and quantitative methods in order to understand the complexities of the social reappropriation of nature in territories of high environmental value. The results indicate that there are recent expressions of capitalism that manifest two lines of argument: first, in the local production of interpretations of nature that value its beauty as a source of capital generation through practices such as tourism, and secondly in the intensification of large-scale hoarding of water resources in the area. It is concluded that local natural spaces of high environmental value become highly attractive spaces, transforming themselves into disputed territories."

The Chilean case is emblematic of this issue, given the implications of neoliberalism and its consequences on environmental injustice. Social movements are now adding the issue of water to their historical demands for land and territory. This paper addresses what features the water struggle has acquired among social movements in Chile by undertaking a critical, geohistorical reading of ongoing social processes. Our conclusions indicate that the agrarian territories are at a crossroads that demands mobilization or risks initiating a process of rural depopulation."

Heterogeneity in policy effectiveness against COVID-19 spread in chile | KEYWORDS: Augmented Synthetic Control; Causal inference; COVID-19; Observational study | ABSTRACT: Several variables and practices affect the evolution and geographic spread of COVID-19. Some of these variables pertain to policy measures such as social distancing, quarantines for specific areas, and testing availability. In this paper, I analyze the effect that lockdown and testing policies had on new contagions in Chile, especially focusing on potential heterogeneity given by population characteristics. Leveraging a natural experiment in the determination of early quarantines, I use an Augmented Synthetic Control Method to build counterfactuals for high and lower-income areas that experienced a lockdown during the first two months of the pandemic. I find substantial differences in the impact that quarantine policies had for different populations: While lockdowns were effective in containing and reducing new cases of COVID-19 in higher-income municipalities, I find no significant effect of this measure for lower-income areas. To further explain these results, I test for difference in mobility during quarantine for high and lower-income municipalities, as well as delays in test results and testing availability. These findings are consistent with previous results, showing that differences in the effectiveness of lockdowns could be partially attributed to heterogeneity in quarantine compliance in terms of mobility, as well as differential testing availability for higher and lower-income areas."

In this context, law 19.749 was established in Chile to facilitate the creation of family microenterprises (FME). However, the social upheaval that occurred in Chile and subsequently the COVID-19 pandemic has had negative repercussions on the country s economy. The present study has the objective of studying the variables that influence the success of family microenterprises. A survey was conducted among micro-entrepreneurs who are beneficiaries of the FME program in the southern sector of the Metropolitan Region. A Probit model was estimated, based on socio-economic information, coming from seventy beneficiaries of entrepreneurial initiatives of a south sector community of the capital, representing 40% of the total. The results show that, in the face of social upheaval, the female gender has a positive correlation, while the number of children has a negative effect. In response to the pandemic, female gender correlates positively, whereas Chilean nationality, number of children, and productive and service sectors are negatively related. Finally, in the context of both events, the number of children and the service sector has a negative influence. The results allow us to predict the relative success of the family enterprises ahead of the arrival of eventual exogenous shock."

As stated in the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ‘climate change is widespread, rapid and intensifying’ and there is certainty that this is a result of human activity. In this context, environmental social responsibility is fundamental to prevent, mitigate or repair the environmental damage generated by productive activity. This obliges us to take concrete actions and thus move from a linear economy approach to a circular economy approach that allows for sustainable development, where waste and pollution are eliminated from the design stage and materials are used for as long as possible. Chile must implement actions that allow it to meet the commitments obtained in its Nationally Determined Contribution of 2020, and move towards sustainable development. The Chilean case is interesting to study because it is a highly exposed and fragile country in the face of climate change. The purpose of this publication is to highlight the current problem of climate change and the threat it poses to our planet, to understand that the circular economy approach as a business model allows for a long-term solution to this problem, to understand the consequences of climate change in Chile and to know the current situation in terms of strategic planning at the country level in relation to the circular economy."

As Chile is considered one of the countries with the highest seismic activity and has experienced several of the most intense earthquakes on record in the world, this work seeks to identify behavioral changes in the birth rate within an affected population related to a natural disaster in Chile. Based on evidence from the 2010 Chilean earthquake, an empirical study was carried out drawing on birth rate data and social data associated with earthquakes in Chile between 2004 and 2015. Two models were estimated. The first model is a difference-in-differences model for determining the effect of the disaster on the birth rate in the affected area in the post-disaster period. The second model is a triple-difference model that includes the trend of the data over time. The results indicate a positive relationship between the variation in the birth rate and the occurrence of the natural disaster. Studying the relationship between disaster events and fertility contributes to understanding the phenomena of social dynamics. This knowledge could improve public policy decision making for better planning in the face of a natural disaster."

More than two hundred thousand people participated in public demonstrations. Facing the failure of the negotiations with the government, the student movement focused on proposing changes to the 2012 Budget Law. What coalitions did the leaders of this student movement form to influence the Budget Law? The aim of this paper was to analyse the factors that explain coalition formation to impact the 2012 Budget Law. In doing so, an analysis has been carried out, focusing on the leaders of the student movement (CONFECH). This paper emphasizes their coalition with the rectors of public universities and their relationship with other educational actors and the opposition parties. The analysis includes the review of documents and national newspapers and interviews with the leaders of the CONFECH. The results of the analysis show that the traditional factors explaining coalition formation are useful but not sufficient to explain the student movement alliances. This paper argues that the factor that explains the student movement coalitions is the ‘strategic sense’ that the movement is focused on an outcome-based strategy. The leaders consider a coalition with the rectors of public universities as outcome-tactics. However, the relationship with opposition parties was much more difficult because of their distrust resulting from what happened in 2006. This study thus has significant implications for the coalition formation theories and its relationship with social movements’ impact."

When these events do occur, they can seriously affect the workers concerned. The moderating effect of social support on the traumatic events' impact on workers is recognized in the literature; the fact that the caregivers' good intentions are not enough to make their support fully effective is also recognized.This article analyzes the support needs of 41 workers affected by different traumatic events at work, the support provided by the professional team, and the workers' perception as to how the support met their needs. The parameters of traumatic events show that workers' support needs remained stable. We also observed differences in how the different types of support and sources of support were perceived. In general, the respondents felt that the support that they received did not adequately meet their needs. These results provide opportunities for the development of preventive measures in companies, support for workers affected by traumatic work events, and, more specifically, avenues for implementing social support by professional teams."

Of divides, skills and socio-technical awareness | KEYWORDS: Digital inclusion; Digital literacy; Internet-ready skills; Socio-technical awareness | ABSTRACT: Purpose: Information and communications technologies (ICTs) have transformed the lives of many people around the world, yet billions remain unconnected. While many initiatives attempt to “connect the unconnected,” initiatives focused on access and skills-development alone will still fall short. Based on the authors’ experience with the SolarSPELL initiative, this study aims to propose using the concept of socio-technical awareness as a step forward in conceptualizing a more accurate picture of capabilities necessary to enable people to make meaningful use of the internet. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses an integrative literature review for the ideas related to the digital divide, digital inclusion and digital literacies, as well as the applied work of the authors in the SolarSPELL initiative, to develop the concept of socio-technical awareness, which is presented as a method for understanding empowered, meaningful internet use. Findings: The argument is made that access, skills- and literacy-development are necessary but insufficient conditions for meaningful ICTs use. Accordingly, a third concept, socio-technical awareness, is introduced, and the case is made for including this concept in both application and measurement of meaningful use of ICTs. Practical implications: The design of digital inclusion initiatives should focus on increasing socio-technical awareness to empower users to make meaningful use of digital technologies. Originality/value: Taking a step further than most assessments of the digital divide or digital inclusion, this study proposes that to achieve meaningful internet use, people need access, requisite skills development and socio-technical awareness, to be able to make informed, empowered decisions about ICT use."

Instead, it advocates for a pedagogy oriented toward the development of critical and reflective thinking, through the incorporation of the historical method and the construction of historical discourse as central pillars of the educational process. The ultimate aim is to strengthen civic education from a critical and contextually grounded perspective. Methods: The study adopts a hermeneutic and critical-reflexive approach, based on an exhaustive review of national and international academic literature. The hermeneutic circle is employed as a methodological strategy to analyze how pedagogical practices can reinterpret historical sources, challenge dominant narratives, and foster historical dialogue in the classroom. Results: The research identifies various pedagogical strategies that operationalize the proposed approach, including structured historical debates, school-based research projects, collaborative analysis of primary and secondary sources, and the integrated use of digital technologies. These strategies are articulated with key categories of historical thinking: contextualization, causality, multicausality, continuity, and change. The study also emphasizes the importance of critical source comparison and the integration of multiple perspectives. Discussion and conclusion: The findings suggest that adopting a socio-critical approach to the teaching of History can transform the classroom into a space for active reflection, fostering a critical and socially engaged citizenry. The study underscores the need to promote teacher training processes that integrate these methodologies, as well as to encourage future empirical research to assess their impact in diverse educational settings. In sum, it advocates for a historical education that forms critically aware individuals, capable of interpreting the past and acting ethically in the present."

The Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory: Short Form of Eight Items was used. A non-regularized network with partial correlation coefficients was estimated through the ggmModSelect algorithm. The network architecture was analyzed for each country through its local properties and global properties. The results indicated that the networks differed significantly between countries. The core dimensions in the networks were relating to others, personal strength, and life value and opportunities, which were more related dimensions that reinforce the emergence of PTG in all countries. The findings may be useful to motivate researchers and mental health professionals to consider the importance of the individual dimensions of PTG in groups of people who experienced the death of a loved one from COVID-19 in 16 Latin American countries, as well as their interrelationships."

Although the OCS has been used in several countries and languages, there is a need for approaches that better integrate the cross-cultural equivalence of the scale. A total of 3185 people participated in the study. The results indicated the presence of a unidimensional structure and good reliability indices for the OCS in each country. The alignment method indicated that the OCS is an invariant measure of COVID-19 obsession among the populations of seven Latin American countries. The findings based on IRT analysis indicated that all OCS items had adequate discrimination and difficulty parameters. The findings contribute to the understanding of the internal structure of the scale in different countries at the same time, something that has been pending evaluation."

From 819 students who did not renew their enrolment, the study considered a sample of 326 students, from whom specific information is considered. It was done a statistic to analysis using a mixed method approach, which gave the result of the following reasons for the academic desertion academic efficiency, statistically meaningful and outstanding among the other considered variables; economic, personal and health problems appear as well. It is highlighted the denial of renewal of enrolment as an important reason about the stated problem. The analysis of this first researcher determined the factors that are part of the problem of the academic’s desertion and, with that in mind; it is possible to establish reasons as well as its classification in order to determine that there exists a problem or reason for students to abandon their university with that careers, and it is possible to present the design of a proposal that helps in the progressive improvement of the topics that cause the academic desertion of university students."

This descriptive study, using qualitative methodology and content analysis had the purpose of interpreting messages about this measure as published at the beginning of the pandemic in Chilean mass media. It considered 63 news obtained in formal media sources on the Internet between April and May 2020.From the analysis, emerged the following thematic categories: social and physical distancing strategy, consequences on the population, messages and expert voices, importance of both social determinants and digital communication channels in a restricted physical environment. Findings indicate that formal media had a fundamental role in the dissemination of expert information based on reliable scientific evidence, in the civic interpellation of citizens, and denouncing health problems, among them, mental health declining of the population. The capacity of people to adapt to digital media for socializing was also exposed, and aspects of the sociocultural determinants affecting the population's perception of risk were incipiently highlighted."

The research project called ""DIFPRORET"" has addressed the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages that the impact of this virus has had on the educational world. The objective of this article is to analyze the perception of 112 subjects about the use of digital platforms through three questions: the educational difficulties encountered in the period of confinement, the main challenges that we must overcome to address education in periods of confinement and which would be the most relevant proposals for improvement in these circumstances. The methodology was approached from the multivariate analysis: multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clusters. It was observed that two of the main educational difficulties are the organization of time and the preparation of activities in contexts of confinement. In this sense, the proposals point to different levels: the improvement of individual student-teacher competences, access to computer resources and investment to alleviate social inequality."

The quantitative data analysis is carried out considering the faculties and careers, the route of entry of the students, type of establishment of origin, and academic's entry factors. It is concluded that without evaluation and monitoring mechanisms this benefit could become an item of the higher education budget without fruitful results for the country. Regarding the result, it is established that in the sample analyzed, students who enter by regular route or University Selection Test (PSU), the score range obtained in High School Grades (NEM), is lower than the PSU and Ranking scores, so it does not influence significantly as an academic income factor, this means that for a student with the benefit prevails the PSU score."

Estudio cualitativo de cuatro barrios excluidos | KEYWORDS: Excluded neighborhoods; External glance; Segregation; Social exclusion; Subjective experience | ABSTRACT: This paper presents a qualitative study carried out with young people from four excluded neighborhoods in Santiago de Chile: La Legua, José María Caro, Lo Hermida and Los Robles. The methodological design involved a variety of data production techniques, allowing us to identify the subjective narratives of their inhabitants, as well as the external perceptions of the neighborhoods. Results suggest that the subjective (or ‘from inside’) perceptions of young people from excluded neighborhoods incorporate the structural inequality that afflicts them, but they are also critical of this reading, as well as the spatial stigmas imputed to them, qualifying such classifications with biographical experiences associated with positive feelings in their neighborhoods. The paper concludes that the concept of excluded neighborhood requires a dialectic articulation between subjectivity and society, or between an internal and external outlook, in order to open new directions for social change."

The aim of this study was to research the relationship between general self-efficacy and academic goals in a sample of Chilean university students, considering the mediating role of self-regulation of learning. Following a quantitative, nonexperimental and cross-sectional approach, an explanatory associative strategy was used to perform a mediation analysis between variables. For this purpose, 231 Chilean university students (68% women), aged between 18 and 29 (M = 19.8; SD = 1.39), answered three self-report instruments. The results from the models tested reveal that self-regulation of learning mediates the relationship between general self-efficacy and academic goals related to learning. It is concluded that the mission of vocational training is to promote occasions for training with learning opportunities for students to face academic tasks trusting in their abilities, self-managing their learning and reaching desired goals."

Estudios de casos | KEYWORDS: Management; Tutorial action plan; Tutoring; University counseling | ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to analyze successful Tutorial Action Plans (TAP) from different institutions, and to generate a reference framework for the creation of a management model for university tutoring. The research was based on case studies from six universities in northeastern Spain, specifically from the Autonomous Communities of Catalonia, Valencia, Aragon and Basque Country, where in-depth interviews were conducted. A qualitative approach was used and the obtained data was processed using the text analysis software Max QDA. This analysis yielded 418 units of meaning, divided into 8 different categories of analyses that were associated with development and management of TAPs. The results from the generated reference framework showed that, the development and impact of TAPs in the analyzed institutions is either positively or negatively affected by: their culture, the role of their authorities, the educational counseling models and the organizational structure that they adopt to support the process of tutorial action. These findings suggest the need of a re-evaluation of the management methods used on university tutoring. The evidence also indicates the existence of pyramidal and collaborative functioning systems, and a combination of clinical models, programs and services that appear more strongly depending on the type of articulation considered in the TAP."
2210,2,"TITLE: Assessing subjective processes and vulnerability in mindfulness-based interventions: A mixed methods exploratory study | KEYWORDS: Contemplative science; Heart rate variability; Micro-phenomenological interview; Mindfulness; Mixed methods; Personality functioning | ABSTRACT: > Context • Research in the contemplative field has focused on trainable capacities that foster self-regulation and integration. From a psychological perspective, mindfulness and personality research has largely grown with a categorical approach that explores the relationship between personality traits and mindfulness skills in clinical contexts. > Problem • There is still a gap in our understanding of the subjective processes that occur through contemplative learning. Moreover, a dimensional personality approach that acknowledges personality functioning and individual vulnerability has not formed part of the discussion in the field. > Method • We used a mixed methods framework to explore change and learning mechanisms among six participants in an eight-week mindfulness-based intervention. Pre- and post-intervention measurements were registered, including a micro-phenomenological interview (MPI) to explore first-person experience in dealing with difficulty, self-reported personality functioning, symptoms, and mindfulness skills, and heart rate variability, to relate self-reporting and phenomenological accounts. > Results • Multiple levels of observation seem to be sensitive to capturing change and processes occurring in mindfulness-based interventions. The MPI analysis points to greater awareness and embodied care as central mechanisms. Personality functioning correlates with autonomic activity during critical phases of the MPI. Conceptual and experiential understanding of new forms of relating to experience are exemplified through a case study. > Implications • This exploratory study contributes to scientific and clinical understanding of healing mechanisms of mindfulness practice. Taking vulnerability into account can help refine therapeutic strategies and clinical sensitivity. The results support more skillful ways of guiding and inquiring in mindfulness practices. Future research should explore subtler levels of experiential and physiological regulatory processes using larger samples, particularly with participants who experience difficulties during practice. > Constructivist content • This work contributes to the development of Francisco Varela’s neurophenomenology project and his scientific interest in contemplative practices as tools for the study of consciousness."
2211,-1,"TITLE: A South–North research agenda for cryotourism in a warming world | KEYWORDS: climate change; cryotourism; glaciers; ice; nature-based tourism; peripheries; snow | ABSTRACT: Cryotourism is a distinct form of tourism which is based on ice and snow cover and is thus highly determined by climatic conditions. While a considerable body of literature addresses the tourism-climate change nexus in (sub-)Arctic and European Alpine regions, little is known about the situation in South American high mountain and sub-Antarctic areas. Against this background, this perspective article presents a research agenda for cryotourism-climate change nexus from a South–North perspective. The initial step toward this objective was an 18-days research visit in Chile and Argentina during January and February 2024. Drawing upon our field notes, current literature and the latest developments in ice and snow-based tourism, we propose three key dimensions for a research agenda, namely: (a) tourism mobilities and southward spatial substitution, (b) socio-ecological implications of cryotourism for local communities, and (c) governance challenges for tourism stakeholders and policymakers. We contend that interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to tourism and climate change research are key aspects to account for the global nature of tourism mobility flows, and the interlinks between local and global processes and impacts of climatic environmental transformations."
2212,-1,"TITLE: A social practice approach to nature-based tours: the case of the Marble Caves in Northern Patagonia, Chile | KEYWORDS: competences; Nature-based tourism; remote peripheral areas; social practices; tourist experience | ABSTRACT: Chile’s Northern Patagonia attracts thousands of tourists, who every summer venture to undertake a range of outdoor activities. In this article, we explore the local production of outdoor activities, by conceptualizing small-scale nature-based tours as a social practice. The study is based on empirical research, taking as a case study the development of the Marble Caves tour, an iconic destination in Northern Patagonia, Chile. The touring practice is analyzed based on the interplay of its material components, required competences and symbolic meanings. Our findings demonstrate that the persistence of the practice is particularly reliant on the competences of the tour operators, and on the abiotic nature of the tourist attraction. Fostering tour guide competences therefore contributes to the sustainability and performance of the practice. We contend that tourism policy interventions that aim to harmonize local development and environmental protection need to carefully analyze and take into account existing social practices."
2213,-1,"TITLE: Disentangling Environmental and Development Discourses in a Peripheral Spatial Context: The Case of the Aysén Region, Patagonia, Chile | KEYWORDS: (de-)peripheralization; core–periphery pattern; discourses; Northern Patagonia; socio-spatial patterns | ABSTRACT: In places with a predominantly natural heritage, environmental and development discourses are intertwined and often competing. A key dimension is the social construction of socio-spatial relationships, and particularly, the attribution of core and periphery features. In this article, we investigate environmental and development discourses in the peripheral spatial context of the Aysén region of Chile. Three research questions guide the investigation: (a) What are the dominant environmental and development discourses? (b) what are the main synergies and tensions among discourses? and (c) what are the (discursive) implications for (de-)peripheralization? Based on semistructured interviews and secondary sources, we identify six regional discourses on environment and development. Imaginaries of nature, regional development, and economic growth are the common denominators that create synergies and tensions. We conclude that environmental and development discourses play a key role in the transformation of geographic peripheral areas. Discursive synergies can not only reinforce but also counteract tendencies of peripheralization."

2215,7,"TITLE: Protest Issues and Political Inequality in Latin America | KEYWORDS: Latin America; political inequality; protest; socioeconomic status | ABSTRACT: Many studies reveal that socioeconomic resources increase protest participation, lending more political voice to the affluent and reinforcing preexisting political inequality. But existing studies ignore whether this holds across different protest issues. We argue that some issues reinforce political inequality, while other ones do not. We differentiate between survival protests—in which people react to direct threats to their material and social survival—and furtherance protests—which press authorities to make policy changes that seek to improve some aspect of society. Regression models with Latin American survey data show that people with higher socioeconomic status are overrepresented in furtherance protests, by implication reinforcing preexisting political inequality. However, survival protests attract people socioeconomically similar to national averages, contributing to a more balanced political field. Our results emphasize the need to reconsider the place of issues in the study of protest participation, political inequality, and political behavior in general."

It is observed the repertoires were characterized by their symbolic contents and a performative form. This specific way of carrying out the act of protest was successful in its aim to mobilize other groups to their cause. However, the salience that the Human Rights situation acquired at the time was progressively displaced as the urgency to start a democratization process gave higher priority to electoral issues. This would end up weakening the mobilization for Human Rights."
2217,-1,"TITLE: The politics of protest in authoritarian regimes. A critical review La política de la protesta en regímenes autoritarios: Síntesis crítica | KEYWORDS: Authoritarianism; Contentious politics; Political regime; Protest; Repression | ABSTRACT: Introduction: Through a critical review of recent literature, the essay explores the relationship between contentious protest and authoritarian regimes and examines the dynamics and consequences that emerge during the political conflict. Methods: three elements that scholars have identified as key in this relationship are discussed: the political opportunities and threats, cycles of protest and the sustainability of the social movements, and the relationship between state violence and collective action. Results: Recurrence of protest in repressive regimes shows the ability of civil society to articulate these contentious actions. Discussion: However, paths and results depend, on the one hand, on the political features of the regime and on the competence of the government to respond to collective challenges; and, on the other hand, on the ability of opponents to mount cycles of protest that are dense in participation during a significant period, the type of tactics adopted, and the adaptability and resilience to the State violence."

It states that landowners developed flexible and complex strategies in which they combined both, their own benefits due to their social position in the local society and, the advantages offered by the national political context. In turn, it was observed that local politics reached such a level of conflict that specific responses from the recently elected government emerged in order to minimize the possible political consequences of the rural workers' movement. This is the reason why it was necessary for the government to subtly and temporally ally with local elites to achieve a successful negotiation."

Using a non-experimental and cross-sectional design, a non-probabilistic sample of 337 users responded to a questionnaire about beliefs associated with both systems. Mean differences were evaluated according to ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and affiliation. It was found that the overall sample holds more negative beliefs about the public system and more positive beliefs about the private system. Additionally, regarding the public healthcare system, indigenous people have more positive beliefs, while non-indigenous people have more negative beliefs. Finally, it was found that individuals with a high socioeconomic level have more positive beliefs about the private health-care system compared to those with a low socioeconomic level. On the other hand, individuals with a high socioeconomic level have more negative beliefs and less positive beliefs than those with a low socioeconomic level regarding the public healthcare system. These findings can be understood in light of cer-tain stereotypes associated with healthcare systems. This is relevant because analyzing beliefs considering users' sociodemographic characteristics allows for the development of strategies that strengthen healthcare systems and reduce social inequities."
2220,5,"TITLE: Should we take care of each other? Enhancing COVID-19 protective behaviors, a study in Chile, Mexico, and Colombia | KEYWORDS: compliance; coronavirus; protective behaviors; risk perception; severity perception; social norms | ABSTRACT: The literature has suggested that social norms and perceptions of risk and severity are critical variables in predicting protective health behaviors. Using an integrative conceptual framework, this study evaluates educational level, socioeconomic status, injunctive pro-care norms, perception of risk, and severity of COVID-19 as predictors of hygiene behaviors, mask use, and physical distancing. Participants included 2,075 adults from Chile, Mexico, and Colombia, three countries with the worst pandemic management. A structural equation model including the hypothesized structure of relations among the study variables fitted the data well and was invariant among Chilean, Mexican, and Colombian data. As proposed, injunctive pro-care norms against COVID-19 predicted protective health behaviors directly and indirectly through the perception of the risk and severity of COVID-19, and educational level predicted pro-care norms against COVID-19. These findings are essential in light of the development of prevention campaigns and the promotion of COVID-19 care strategies."
2221,5,"TITLE: To get vaccinated or not? Social psychological factors associated with vaccination intent for COVID-19 | KEYWORDS: beliefs; conspiracy theories; infection diseases; public health; vaccination intent; vaccine hesitancy | ABSTRACT: Pandemic control not only requires effective COVID-19 vaccines but also that they are accepted by at least 80% of the population. For this reason, understanding the social psychological variables associated with vaccination intent is essential to achieve herd immunity. Drawing on the theory of reasoned action, this study seeks to analyze vaccination intent using the beliefs about vaccine effectiveness, conspiracy theories, and injunctive norms as predictors. A non-probabilistic national online survey was conducted during December 2020. A sample of 1,033 people in Chile answered a questionnaire with the study variables. Using structural equation models, it was found that vaccination intent was explained in 62.1% by beliefs about vaccine effectiveness and injunctive norms, controlling for age, political orientation, socioeconomic status, educational level, and gender. Specifically, beliefs about vaccine effectiveness are based on people's experience with previous immunization processes, which predict vaccination intent. Regarding injunctive norms, they act by influencing and encouraging vaccination by seeking the approval of significant others. Contrary to expected, conspiracy beliefs were not directly associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but were highly related to lower beliefs about vaccine effectiveness. This study suggests that to enhance the vaccination intent, socio-psychological and structural variables need to be considered."

The forced acculturative experience of indigenous minorities and its differentiation of gender roles could impact how people respond to this scale. The purpose of this study was to exa-mine the measurement invariance of the SWLS when it is applied to a Chilean indigenous group, considering gender and their most frequent acculturative types (i.e., acculturated and bicultural). Eight hundred adults of Mapuche origin answered a Spanish version of the SWLS and the Mapuche Acculturation Scale. The results supported the SWLS strict invariance between acculturated and bicultural and also between acculturated men and women. Partial strict invariance was found between bicultural men and women; specifically, the residual variance of Item 3 was higher in women than in men. Since Spanish is a gendered language, a linguistic explanation is proposed for the non-invariance of this item. The importance of careful wording of the items, when administe-red in multilanguage acculturation contexts, is discussed."
2223,0,"TITLE: The reliability of language-switch costs in bilingual one- and two-digit number naming | KEYWORDS: Bilingualism; correlation; language switching; split-half reliability | ABSTRACT: Aims and objectives/purpose/research questions: Language-switch costs, which denote worse performance in language-switch than in language-repetition trials, appear to be a robust finding in bilingual language switching. The aim of the present study was to examine the intraindividual reliability of language-switch costs by means of a number-naming task with German-English bilinguals. Design/methodology/approach: In a cued language-switching paradigm, participants (n = 36) switched between German and English. They performed a number-naming task in three different conditions: one-digit numbers; two-digit numbers with decade 10; and two-digit numbers with decade 20. Data and analysis: We examined the experimental effects with an analysis of variance (reaction time and error rate as the dependent variables), using trial language, language sequence and number condition as independent variables. In addition, we calculated the split-half reliability of language-switch costs (across all conditions) as well as the correlations of language-switch costs between the different conditions. Findings/conclusions: While significant language-switch costs emerged in all three number conditions, our results demonstrate a medium-sized correlation between the three experimental conditions. The split-half reliability shows a moderate to strong correlation between the odd- and even-numbered trials in the experiment. Originality: On the one hand, the present study extends the observation of language-switch costs from one-digit number naming to the more complex naming of two-digit numbers. On the other hand, and theoretically even more important, we explored the reliability of language-switch costs in a bilingual number-naming task by calculating both split-half reliability and correlations between different number conditions. Significance/implications: The results indicated that while language-switch costs are a robust experimental effect on the group level, they appear to be less well suited for correlational approaches. This also suggests that caution should be exerted when language-switch costs are used to diagnose the ability of an individual to perform language control."
2224,14,"TITLE: Navigating shifting waters: Subjectivity, oil extraction, and Urarina territorial strategies in the Peruvian Amazon | KEYWORDS: Amazonia; Extractivism; Indigenous territories; Peru; Subjectivity; Urarina | ABSTRACT: This paper examines the relationships between extractive infrastructure, changing territorial strategies, and contemporary processes of subject formation among the Urarina, an indigenous people in the Peruvian Amazon. We first introduce the uneven and combined character of oil extraction in the Loreto region in north-eastern Peru, and how its racialised spatial contradictions are expressed in the ethnopolitical field that gives political form to regional extractive operations. The paper goes on to analyse the case of the Urarina people in the Chambira river basin, their particular place in the geography of extraction, and the case of the community of Nueva Union. We examine contemporary processes of subject formation in the community, which combine radical transformations in the role of money, territorial strategies, use and valuation of the environment, and changes in political structure, in non-linear ways. The paper closes by examining how the case of the community of Nueva Union sheds light on broader dynamics of subject formation, localised relations to the environment, and extraction as they play out in contemporary indigenous Amazonia."

Starting from Marx’s understanding of value as social form, I revisit Neil Smith’s contribution to the question of value and nature and argue for a reassessment of the internal relations between valorisation and the ‘vernacular’ dimensions of socio-ecological reproduction. I approach this problem through Bolívar Echeverría’s reconstruction of the category of use-value and his understanding of the pivotal role it plays in Marx’s critique, which allows for an open and non-reductive account of the subsumption of socio-ecologies under capitalism as contradictory entanglements of abstraction and meaning. The paper mobilises these insights alongside Marxian-inspired anthropological theories of value – the work of Terence Turner and David Graeber – in order to sketch elements for a symbolic-materialist framework to approach the question of value in its cultural-moral register, its relation to value as economic form, and issues of moral economy and ecology under capitalism."

We therefore tease out the historically and geographically specific ways in which human bodies have been (re)produced as infrastructure, emphasising the violence of abstraction in capitalist modernity that transforms the productive body into a technology of calorific inputs and outputs. Nevertheless, through demystifying abstract labour we point to the relations of (re)production (needed for the body’s ongoing repair) and the metabolic processes (responsible for both decay and repair) that are subsumed within a broader capitalist system of accumulation. In so doing, we turn to the immanent contradictions and struggles that resist the body’s production as a one-sided technology of circulation and through which it is, and can become, an infrastructure for life and sociality."

The present study compared the sensory profile of typically developing (TD) children with those of children with learning disorders (LD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and with developmental language disorder (DLD), and investigated the association between the child’s sensory profile and reading and maths learning difficulties. Seventy-four parents of children aged between 8 and 10 years old participated, completing the Colorado Learning Difficulties Questionnaire (CLDQ) and the Child Sensory Processing Profile (CSP-2) assessments of their child’s performance on literacy/mathematics and sensory processing, respectively. There was strong evidence of abnormal sensory processing across the range of learning disorders and across all four ‘quadrants’ of the CSP-2. The children with ASD, ADHD, and DLD had major abnormalities. In contrast, children with LD showed significant but more modest differences. There was a significant association between the sensory profile and the mathematics component of the CLDQ. The findings highlight shared abnormalities in sensory processing across the range of developmental disorders and have substantial theoretical and applied implications."

These circumstances have obliged teachers to employ a range of strategies aimed at enhancing their students' learning experiences. The knowledge acquired during this health crisis, particularly the use of digital technologies, now presents an opportunity for fostering more dynamic learning methods, such as Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), one of the active learning approaches frequently discussed in educational literature as a positive influence on students' learning processes. To harness this opportunity and facilitate the adoption of digital technologies, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of how to use them for the implementation of IBL. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review to investigate how digital technologies have contributed to the progress of IBL. We. We analyzed a total of 25 articles that have demonstrated positive academic outcomes and identified seven key roles that digital technologies play in IBL: i) guiding the IBL process; ii) representation of the phenomena to be investigated; iii) source of access to content; iv) data collection tool; v) tool for organizing ideas and information; vi) tool for sharing ideas and information; and vii) tool for receiving feedback. This review reveals that the digital tools commonly employed to facilitate IBL phases are generally conventional. Nevertheless, there are opportunities to introduce new technologies to enhance students’ active learning at all IBL stages."

LUGARES DE COVID-19 EN CONTEXTO DE CONFLICTOS SOCIO-ESPACIALES POR LA DIGNIDAD EN CHILE | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; disasters; place; politics; well-being | ABSTRACT: The objective of the manuscript is to reflect on the construction of COVID-19 places in the context of socio-spatial conflicts for dignity in Chile. On October 18, 2019, a conflict exploded in the country, challenging forms of national governance naturalized for decades. Te recognition of the human quality and well-being for a dignified life, such as intergenerational solidarity, guaranteeing rights, such as public health quality, gender equality, living free of contamination, set the agenda for massive mobilizations and protests. When non-places began to transform into places, the crisis in health policy emerged surrounding COVID-19, which demonstrates the scope of the immense inequalities in the country, and the imperative challenge of promoting multidisciplinary work, which, in turn, strengthens links between the university and civil society, to face this disaster of the 21st century."

Based on these transformations, the objective of this article is to analyse a set of policies aimed at the attention of special needs students. Methodologically, a documentary work was conducted, in which texts related exclusively to the attention of students with special needs were selected, and which were temporarily published between 1990 and 2018. Thus, a corpus of 14 documents was obtained, seven of which are analysed in-depth in this article. The analysis of the texts occurred in two phases: first, from a hermeneutical distancing process (Ricoeur, 1986, 2003), and, later, from a deconstructive analysis (Derrida, 1997). Among the most relevant findings, the binarisation of inclusion is observed, reducing it to the erection of barriers of accessing and teaching, and the shifting from disciplinary logic associated to normalisation to others of self-regulation. Finally, the emergence of logics of standardised difference was observed, which leans toward a normocentrality, where otherness would be understood as threat."
2231,0,"TITLE: Protagonism and relationship aesthetics in applied theatre with young people ""Protagonismo y Estética del Vínculo en Applied Theatre with Young People "" | KEYWORDS: Aesthetic; Applied Theatre; Efficacy; Participants; Protagonism | ABSTRACT: The paper explores the aesthetic consequences of the turn of the participant-protagonist, embodied by Applied Theatre, through case analysis of practices and experiences, and interviews with practitioners and organizations that work on Applied Theater with Young People in London. The notion of the 'applied' challenges the 'pure/applied' or 'aesthetic/efficacy' binarisms present in modern western culture. First, gaps and agreements between these apparently contradictory dimensions are reviewed, both at a conceptual level and in the research's context. Next, through a matrix, several cases are analyzed, and the conditions of application that favor the participants' protagonism and enhance aesthetic developments are discussed. As a result of the focus on participants, a Relationship Aesthetics arises. It features situated character, collaborative creativity, facilitation culture, and promotes the experimentation and development of diverse relationship-aesthetics-languages. This approach allows to redefining 'effects' by 'affects', as a consequence, gaps disappear, and binarisms are integrated. Finally, through the Relationship Aesthetics, Applied Theater emerges as a powerful source of creative potential while defending the universal right to artistic experience, and democratization of art."

Literature has played a paramount role in illustrating many of the challenges of narrating the experience of migration. This role is the motivation for this Special Issue as it examines the literary mechanisms that engage with current social, economic, and political issues and shows how discourses on migration contest perspectives on concepts such as “mobility” or “space.” Thus after contextualizing “the Black Atlantic,” “diaspora space,” “third scenario,” “necropolitics” or “gore capitalism,” this introduction describes the contributors' diverse critical readings, which are presented and organized to illustrate the evolution of academic research around Diaspora Studies. The new avenues of research that 21st-century migration has fostered bear witness to the complex and intricate phenomena of human mobility."

The poem delves into criticism of both Chilean neoliberal reality and a wider Latin American context in which the US has become a new economic and cultural hegemonic entity to be resisted from the margins. As a follow-up from the poetry/performance work Poesía es + (2002), co-authored with Malú Urriola, ©Copyright explores expression or its lack thereof within a profit-driven Chilean democratic transitional moment. Prado’s poetry opens up space that paves the way for a deep critique of neo-colonialism and neoliberalism. At the same time, this poem becomes part of a larger corpus of poetic, narrative and critical work that has compiled concerns and discontents since neoliberalism was imposed in Chile."

Evidence from three poetry collections—Alejandra Del Río's Written in Braille (1999), Marina Arrate's Uranium (1999), and Malú Urriola's Butterfly Stroke (2007)—connect directly to Mistral's proposal in “The Other.” These contemporary poets take up the psychic unfolding of the speaker in that poem to vindicate the woman that in Mistral's work was annihilated. These three contemporary poets prove that now is time for women to freely express themselves and their desires through the written word, subverting traditional patriarchal discourse."

The mainstream opinion asserts that these declarations are non-binding decisions. The paper argues that these instruments have an important role in the administration of the SEIA, which should lead to the recognition of their having a relative binding effect. It proposes, drawing from a responsive regulation approach, a reinterpretation of the legal norms that establish the powers of the Chilean Environmental Evaluation Service and the Chilean Superintendency of the Environment in order to harmonize the relative bindiness of the pertinence declarations with the inspection powers of the Environmental Surveillance Agency."

This kind of rule is seldom found in Civil Law systems. Hence, its application can generate some shortcomings. In fact, it can be seen that the CGR's precedents, in some cases, are not properly published and that they are applied to future cases as if they were abstract rules, rather than decisions referred to particular cases which are binding on sufficiently similar future cases. A different understanding of the CGR's case law bindingness is proposed."

2242,0,"TITLE: The somatic roots of affect: Toward a body-centered education | KEYWORDS: Affective consciousness; Emotions; Homeostasis; Interoception; Learning | ABSTRACT: The deep influence of affectivity on learning is now widely acknowledged (Keefer et al., 2018; Sanchez-Alvarez et al., 2021). For instance, it has been shown that affect influences key learning-relevant processes, such as motivation, perception, behavior, and critical thinking (Izard, 2002; Mayer & Salovey, 1997). Evidence also shows that emotion and mood strongly influence attention, which in turn drives learning and memory (Elbertson et al., 2010; Elias et al., 1997). Intersubjective phenomena, such as the degree of affection and respect between child and teacher, also affect the child's learning processes, academic outcomes, and brain development (Kusche & Greenberg, 2006; Ryan & Patrick, 2001). However, the relevant literature is not paying attention to increasing evidence showing that affective phenomena are rooted in interoceptive and homeostatic self-and co-regulatory processes within and between people's living bodies (Barrett, 2017; Carvalho & Damasio, 2021; Craig, 2015, 2018; Fotopoulou et al., 2022; Fotopoulou & Tsakiris, 2017; Seth & Friston, 2016). In this theoretical chapter, we explore this connection and its importance for learning. We argue that affective experience plays a fundamental role in learning, and that affective experience is rooted in the homeostatic self-/co-regulation of living bodies. Therefore, the homeostatic self-/co-regulation of living bodies plays a fundamental role in learning. In other words, there is an intra-and interpersonal somatic dimension of learning that demands explicit consideration in educational contexts. In this way, we aim to contribute to an understanding of learning and education that moves away from an individualistic, brain-centered information-processing conception toward one centered on sentient, interdependent living bodies."

To do this, classic texts that demonstrate this construction are examined and, in the case of Chile, it is historically exemplified with some 19th century literature from La Revista Católica, published in the country from 1843 to 2022. The study seeks to demonstrate how, through the centuries, and specifically in the 19th century, the church confined female sexuality to the space of marriage, generating a dichotomy with other types of historical expression of female sexuality, such as commercial, which was pushed to the margins of the abject and sin, as a synonym of social and moral degradation."

These locations represent a vernacular geographical language through which Black communities have constituted and imagined their Black worlds. In contrast, the haciendas or cattle ranches have played a role in spatialising the coloniality of power. In this paper, I analyse ethnographically, on the one hand, how sitios, vegas, and rozas have historically articulated Black spatial imaginaries and practices in southwestern Colombia. On the other hand, the haciendas have implied the erasure of Black spatial experiences. Based on the concept of a Black sense of place and establishing theoretical bridges between the decolonial and ontological turn, I argue that, through the geographical principles of location, distribution, and relation, the Black populations enact inside practices that assemble, choreograph, and define their sense of place. I also argue that the Black sense of place has been erased in the area of study, through spatial tactics, such as dispossession, invisibility, and terror."

In this context, it aims to examine the geographies, networks and re-existences that have unfolded among the black populations of the Patía Valley and the Colombian South Pacific in the light of socio-historical and geographical evidence from 1993 to 2020. Using works published in the last three decades, our strategy consisted in identifying the historical processes, re-existences, and the ways in which these territories have been discursively produced. While the South Pacific has been traversed by different extractivist cycles from colonial times to the present, and in the last three decades by a process that co-produces ethnicity and biodiversity, we found, due to its colonial experience, that the Patía Valley is tied to maroon practices that have crystallized in everyday life, thus giving rise to re-existence. Finally, we establish that both spaces have been the object of constitutive violence that has produced terrorized lands."

The “inside” means to know, walk, describe and control space. An experiential vision of the territory, where the “inside” is pluralized, dilates, locates, organizes, and distributes on different levels. The “outside” is articulated with activities whose possibility of materialization concerning other spaces. The central argument is that this area has been produced from encounters, crystallized in spaces such as los ojos de agua (water eyes), and through disagreements, expressed in conflicts over land. For this, we use the notion of territory and territoriality. Against the first, it is argued that it is built based on power relations that operate in different fields and scenarios of everyday social interaction. The second is understood in four senses: historically sensitive use of space, how they use the earth and organize space, strategy to affect, influence, and control, and space strategy that can be turned on or off. Finally, we conclude that in these modalities of construction of territoriality, the “inside”-“outside” enter dispute, friction, and negotiation, in which the latter overlaps the former."

Learning conditions of these students in the previous years of their university life were completely online, interrupting normal socialization, at a key age of their neurodevelopment. A self-perception survey was applied to identify those factors that currently affect the students’ socioemotional processes with special attention on those related with academic performance. This is a quantitative study with a correlational descriptive scope. The study population consisted of 150 individuals admitted in 2021 and 2022. For the analysis of the results obtained from the survey on a Likert scale, associations were made according to the results of the Pearson correlation matrix. To the open questions, a NLP (Natural Language Processing) analysis was implemented, which consisted of counting words. Following the results of the survey, changes in teaching and learning strategies were implemented, which allowed improving the socioemotional gaps detected among students, improving their academic performance and perception of the contents addressed by the academics of the different subjects. Results drove us to the design of opportune academic strategies which tried to facilitate the transit to face-to-face learning and university life, safeguarding the students’ proper training process."

This study seeks to understand the memories of Mapuche women through an ethnographic work with an intersectional gender perspective, which included in-depth interviews and discussions with women from the Metropolitan, Biobío, La Araucanía, and Los Ríos regions. Results raise awareness over the familial and collective ruptures caused by diaspora processes in the second half of the 19th century and during the Chilean civic-military dictatorship (1973-1990). However, the study also reveals resistance strategies that these women have displayed collectively. Since they have been able to create, from their positioning and conditions, and according to their experiences on their socio-historical contexts, their own ways of confronting colonial, patriarchal, and classist violence, drawing on their Mapuche knowledge, despite the tensions within their lof -territories with their own sociopolitical and spiritual organization-social organizations, and families."

Within this framework, this chapter seeks to unveil the colonial and patriarchal rationality that reduces and limits public policies, as well as to show the contributions of Indigenous Feminisms and the visibilisation of non-hegemonic knowledge that has been excluded in the process of creating public policies. For this purpose, the notion of ‘monocultural’ public policies is addressed, which underlies an idea of social development that excludes racialised people, particularly women. Based on these reflections, a process of decolonisation and depatriarchalisation of public policies is proposed and related to the challenges for the construction of a decolonial social work with a gender perspective located in Chile."

In addition, these oppressions intersect women in a particular way. We frame this article in a doctoral thesis with mapuche women, in and from the diaspora, and we reflect in a decolonial and gender perspective on the experiences of sexualities and maternities of mapuche women living in the city of Santiago and the Wallmapu -the mapuche historical territory-, and on their experiences of sexuality and maternity. We used a qualitative methodology through participant observation, interviews with six researchers and in-depth interviews with mapuche women in the Metropolitan Region, Biobío, La Araucanía and Los Ríos. The results we present show intersectionalities of class, race and gender. Likewise, they also show subjectivities, political practices of transformations and continuities of mapuche tradition in everyday family, community and political spaces."

These tensions are related to oppressions of gender, social class and racism. Thus, in this study we position ourselves in an intersectional perspective, in order to reflect on the particular experiences of Mapuche women. Specifically, we address the stance on sexuality and motherhood that Mapuche women experience in their family, work and political militancy contexts. The latter refer to the lof, family and socio-historical territorial settlements in the Wallmapu and also in the city of Santiago. We conducted fieldwork between 2017-2018 in the Metropolitan, Biobío, La Araucanía and Los Ríos regions. Such work contemplated in-depth interviews and participant observations. The results show generational transformations of the experiences of the actors in this study. Such transformations are linked to socio-historical contexts and political positioning, related to the struggles of the actors for gender equity and the revitalization of Mapuche identity with their own adaptations."

In this article, we examine the possibilities of front-line community social workers dismantling such a hegemonic rationale. Drawing upon the contributions of Latin American decolonial thought, we argue that social workers are able to exert resistance on the individual, competitive and instrumental approaches underlying their community interventions by decolonising their understandings and professional practices, and by being involved in collective political action. An exploration of Mapuche philosophy is offered as a means to illustrate some key dimensions in order to scrutinise community interventions and challenge the traditional mainstream Western and Eurocentric notions of community, knowledge and professional bonds and encounters. These proposals apply when working not only with culturally different populations, but also with all those subaltern groups oppressed by the neoliberal and neo-colonial rationale, in the interest of contributing to cognitive justice – another dimension of social justice."

Considering the intersectional gender perspective, focused on the diverse and heterogeneous oppression matrices that racialized women face in different socio-historical contexts, we have developed a multi-situated ethnography, with in-depth interviews, to reach the significant experiences of 20 mapuche women from the Metropolitan, Biobío, La Araucanía and Los Ríos regions. The results show us that the diasporic situation of mapuche women is transforming their mapuche and gender identity, thus putting a strain on both their private and public worlds. Also, tears and resistances that they create and re-create coexist, based on their own mapuche knowledge and discursive practices with which they confront class, racial and gender oppressions. We conclude that professional mapuche women, in the context of the diaspora, take resistance not only to their socio-labour spaces, but also to their family relations, their political activism and their gender relations."

This article delves, from an analytical and political perspective, into the experiences of Mapuche women who have worked in domestic service in Santiago de Chile, the capital city of the country with the highest number of Mapuche women. This is a multisited ethnographic research comprising the regions of El Biobío, La Araucanía, and Los Ríos, and the city of Santiago. The decolonized and decolonizing methodological perspectives used involved knowledge and social conventions characteristic of the Mapuche people. The methodological strategy included participating observation. Thirty two Mapuche women, who lived in the diaspora and have returned to the Wallmapu, participated. In-depth interviews were carried out with twenty women. Four discussion groups were conducted with 12 women, including two of the interviewed women, in the city of Santiago and in the regions of La Araucanía and Los Ríos. The findings show colonial continuities in racialized work spaces, which manifest themselves in a variety of class, race, and gender clashes, and which dialectically give rise to subjectivities and everyday micro-resistances that shape the Mapuche diaspora identity of these women."

By contrast, how class mistreatment is (re)produced in routine cross-class interactions within elite settings has received far less empirical attention. Building on 60 interviews, in this article I study how the upwardly mobile experience class mistreatment at selective universities and professional workplaces in Chile. Findings substantiate the continuity of class mistreatment the upwardly mobile face in such elite settings, including various and repeated forms of discrimination and stigmatisation. Findings also show that such class mistreatment is strongly inflected by gender and ethnicity, and plays a key role in shaping the lack of fit the upwardly mobile confront in those elite settings."

Much less studied, however, are the relationships, particularly romantic ones, potentially easing the class dislocation often tied to upward mobility. In this article, I draw upon 60 life-history interviews to examine how long-range upwardly mobile individuals relate and develop romantic ties in contemporary Chile. My findings reveal how romantic partners act as key bonds helping to mitigate the dislocating effects accompanying upward mobility, offering a ‘refuge’ and providing multifaceted support to the upwardly mobile, both in their adjustment to their class destination and when negotiating demands and ties with their class origins. These findings call for a new research agenda in the study of class, social mobility and intimacy."

However, while there is growing body of research on the explanations individuals provide for inequality in the US and Europe, there is a striking absence of studies addressing how people experiencing long-range upward mobility relate to meritocratic values in Latin American societies. In this article I draw upon on 60 life-course interviews to examine how long-range upwardly mobile individuals – those who best embody the meritocratic ideal – explain their success in Chilean society. Internationally well-known for the implementation of radical neoliberal reforms since the mid 1970s, Chile has both elevated levels of inequality and high rates of occupational mobility. Contrary to the individual-centred approach to meritocratic success dominant in the existing literature, my findings reveal a strong collective framing in respondents’ accounts and the acknowledgement of external factors shaping their upward trajectories. These findings bear important conceptual, methodological and geographical implications for the future study of social mobility and meritocratic values."

By that point, it had been almost five months since the beginning of one of the largest social revolts in the country’s history. This extensive popular uprising has been characterised by the eruption of multiple national protests, and by the appearance and strengthening of diverse, non-traditional political organisations. And while it was sparked by a small increase in subway fares, it has highlighted the build-up of discontent generated by the structures of a deeply unequal society. It is against this backdrop that the COVID-19 pandemic arrives in Chile, a country that, for almost 50 years, has implemented far-reaching neoliberal structural adjustments in an uninterrupted fashion, initially imposed in 1975 by the civil-military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and deepened by the subsequent democratic governments. The objective of this text is to elaborate a general reflection on the present crisis from within a genealogical framework, one that will foster an analysis of certain elements of the post-dictatorship moment as key to comprehending the present."

To answer this question, we use a regression model to analyze data from the Chilean government. Our analysis indicates that municipalities with a higher proportion of Indigenous people evinced higher rates of infection and deaths to COVID-19. Indigenous groups were not only highly affected at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak; their rate of infection and mortality has increased as the virus has spread to the general population. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic can have devastating effects on Indigenous communities, mainly because it increases the historically accumulated inequalities and structural racism linked to colonization, neoliberalism, and neo-extractivism in Chile."

Democracy, inclusion, participation and a peaceful resolution of conflict can be promoted through coexistence, articulating the entire daily nature of school. This paper reviews empirical research conducted in Latin America-due to the importance of the subject in this region-, considering countries, methodologies, and the most recurring dimensions in this works, as well as their results. In order to perform this review, the researchers used Google Scholar because it provided a broader search range than other tools and it has free access; in addition, a period of 10 years was considered, between 2007 and 2017. Finally, 64 empirical research articles were selected. The results show that most of them come from 4 countries: Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico; most of the works are diagnostic in nature; interviews are the most used technique; and conflict is the most recurrent topic. Other relevant results suggest that school violence usually is approached through punishment, that there is a lack of information about school coexistence during the first semesters of teacher training, that respect is a core school value, that conflict is associated with violence-which makes it hard to approach-, that there is a positive valuation towards cultural diversity, and that participation is a central element in school coexistence."

We advance these discussions by analyzing 361 reports on the 2019 Chilean uprising aired on both a private and a public broadcasting station, using television coverage as a heuristic device. Drawing on Chan and Lee’s original argument describing the existence of several protest paradigms, as well as debates on policing demonstrations, we propose that 2 paradigms were at play in the coverage: an “antagonistic” one, which delegitimizes and marginalizes dissent, and a “paternalistic” one, which celebrates “good” protesters and “well-behaved” collective action. These paradigms echo developments in policing protests, with journalists manufacturing what we call media kettling, a type of coverage that celebrates the right to protest but severely restricts collective action."

This phenomenon tends to be criticized by experts, professionals, and members of the audience who associate melodrama with sensationalism or the coverage of irrelevant events. This article presents the results of two studies carried out in Chile using qualitative methods (focus groups, in the first case, and in-depth interviews, in the second). They aimed to explore the audience's perceptions of the use of melodramatic resources in the Chilean open television news and the characteristics they value and reject, and find differences in such perception regarding informative coverage of highly emotional news, such as disasters. The results show mixed perceptions, between criticism and optimism, as the participants in both studies highlight that, while excess melodrama bothers them, its inclusion in news programs develops empathy and moves them to action. As to the coverage of disasters, stories are perceived differently between those affected and not affected by their consequences."

Through a self-administered questionnaire, basic information was collected (n = 146), as an input to develop a digital education strategy aimed at these adults, who face the challenge of raising an ecosystem different from their own childhood and for which they have not been prepared. The results show the need for transmedia literacy, so that parents have adequate resources to assertively guide the growth of their children in the information society and in the network society."

A review of the current framework of protection given to honour and reputation will be useful to assess the structure of the compensation of non-pecuniary losses, distinguishing between normative and consequential ones, as well as highlighting to what extent “pure” moral losses are redressed. Additionally, the limitations imposed by other jurisdictions such as English and French law will be outlined, focusing on both the cases where secondary victims can claim such losses, as well as the restrictions imposed on the class of persons who can make such claims. All this will expose how the Chilean legal system shows signs of being one of the most liberal of the world regarding the breadth of the compensation of non-pecuniary losses, this being only one example among many others."

The Role of Interest Groups During the 2022 Midterm Election in the US | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This study analyzes political ads aired on Spanish-language radio stations in the US during the midterm elections of 2022. With a focus on media policy, this research offers new evidence about the role of political groups in using this medium to engage and mobilize the Latino vote. Our findings indicate that, although radio is a relatively affordable platform for political advertising, it is still underutilized by politicians and interest groups. The evidence shows that traditional Democratic-leaning organizations and also right-wing conservative groups invested millions of dollars to capture the attention of the diverse eligible Latino voters. Additionally, this study finds that specific issues commonly associated with the Latino community, such as immigration, are not necessarily the main subjects of interest for groups using radio for political advertising. The importance of radio for Latinos makes this research relevant from a theoretical and policy-oriented perspective."

Using topic modeling and network analysis, we studied over 30,064 online news articles from 13 online news sources in the U.S. between January 2017 and December 2020 to examine the news frame usage and depiction of immigration by these different publications. Our results present evidence of an ideological frame highly used by Liberal and Conservative online news outlets, which shows a tendency to discuss this critical topic considering ideology-based issues. However, we also offer proof of news coverage of immigration that can deliver nuanced and less ideologically charged reporting."

Using a combination of topic modelling and network analysis, we inductively identify the frames used to depict refugees and then examine the factors that help shape the news framing of the issue between various countries. We unveiled five frames: cultural and everyday life, Global North politics, aid, violence and international conflict. We also identified significant correlations between distance to country of origin and political stability and news frame usage, giving insights into the political, economic and cultural contexts that interact in the frame-building stage of the coverage of refugees in different countries. From a theoretical perspective, this study advances the understanding of news coverage of refugees, particularly the differences emerging between the Global North and the Global South countries."
2273,11,"TITLE: Moving North: Analysis of News Representation of Central American Immigration in the U.S. and Mexico | KEYWORDS: Central America‌; Comparative media analysis; immigration; media systems; Mexico; United States | ABSTRACT: Through a qualitative comparative analysis, we examine how Mexican and U.S. newspapers cover the massive arrival of Central Americans in 2014 and 2016. We find that the representation of these migrants in these two countries reflects the specific characteristics of each country’s liberal media system model. In the U.S. coverage, characterized by a “Liberal"" media system model that is relatively independent from government sources, the arrival of Central Americans is portrayed as a chaotic situation that overwhelmed border agencies and the immigration system. In doing so, it prevails a legacy discourse on the “illegality” of the phenomenon, highly characteristic of how U.S. media has historically depicted this population. In contrast, Mexican newspapers coverage is heavily influenced by official voices, depicting Central Americans as victims of human rights violations and as “in-transit” foreigners trying to reach the U.S. In this coverage, the government emerges as less accountable for the immigration crisis, reflecting its “Captured Liberal” media system model. By bringing together research in developed and developing nations, our comparative findings offer initial evidence about the influence of two media system models in shaping immigration news."

There are currently over 400 institutions of higher education considered (HSIs) in the United States. For decades, the internationalization process at HSIs revolved around practices such as study abroad. However, most of their students did not have the resources to leave their jobs and study abroad. Additionally, international mobility became highly restricted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and study abroad experiences significantly decreased (IIE, 2022). Therefore, the internationalization at home model is of greater importance for students at HSIs. In this article, we analyze some of the consequences of the decrease in study abroad opportunities, but we also provide examples of successful alternative cases that can continue to be used and developed within the internationalization at home model."
2275,11,"TITLE: Spanish-Language Radio and Issue Advertising: Targeting Latinos during the 2018 Elections | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This research examines how Spanish radio stations in the United States were used to reach Latinos through non-candidate political (issue) advertising during the midterm election of 2018. Spanish-Language radio is an essential part of the weekly media diet of the Latinos in the U.S. and reaches almost all adults in this demographic. Using an unprecedented and detailed analysis of advertising records from the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s political file database, this study analyzes the issues employed by outside groups who were targeting a diverse, but largely underrepresented population demographic. Despite more than 160,000 total political ads representing more than $13 million in spending, the data suggests that radio, as a media platform, was under-utilized by groups targeting Latinos during the 2018 midterm elections, as less than a third of all the Spanish-Language radio stations in the U.S. carried political advertising. This study concludes that interest groups missed an opportunity to maximize political participation among Latinos through targeted appeals on topics like immigration, jobs, education, and housing. Theoretical implications for engaging Latinos in political processes are also discussed."

Despite Chile's development level, the participation of females in the workforce lags behind (at around 50%), and 72% of female carers of an older relative are not in the labour force. This paper explores the reasons why in Latin America adult children remain out of the labour force while caring for an older parent or parent-in-law who has support needs. It draws on 30 in-depth interviews of family carers from low- to high-income households. The interviews were carried out in Chile in 2017, and were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis to identify core themes related to the subjects’ reasons for remaining out of the labour force. Four factors hinder the combination of paid work and caring for a parent or parent-in-law with support needs: (a) externalised care was too expensive; (b) finding non-precarious, flexible work was difficult; (c) their perception of femininity or womanhood conflicted with the idea of combining care and paid work; and (d) they experienced a lack of public and/or social support."
2277,5,"TITLE: Improving Long-Term Care Facilities’ Crisis Response: Lessons From the COVID-19 in Chile | KEYWORDS: aged care; Chile; COVID-19; long-term care; nursing homes; SARS-CoV-2 | ABSTRACT: Context: The COVID-19 pandemic hit Chile hard and affected older people the most. Through its National Service for Older Adults, the country implemented a strategy to prevent and mitigate infection and spread in long-term care facilities (LTCF), reaching regulated and registered residences and, for the first time, informal and unregistered residences. Objective: Identify the challenges and lessons from the COVID-19 response in LTCF with respect to the support received, the implementation of infection control measures, workforce challenges experienced and the measures adopted to promote residents’ wellbeing. Methods: An online questionnaire was sent to all LTCF managers (N = 385, Response Rate = 32.4%). Statistical tests compare results to identify differences across LTCF characteristics: residence size, location and management type (private, public or subsidized, or informal). Findings: Irrespective of their location, size or management, managers highlight common challenges during the crisis. They include limited personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, staff shortages, low quality of replacement staff, reduced staff mental health, and the difficulty to understand and implement protocols. Managers acknowledge receiving institutional support in the form of PPE provision and opportunities for staff training, but managers noted the need to expand this support to cover staffing surge needs, staff psychological needs, and ensure the continuity of clinical support for residents as well. Managers share a common demand for a more coordinated response from public institutions. Managers recognize that the pandemic and the measures implemented to mitigate it negatively affected staff morale and residents’ wellbeing. Many noted that peer-to-peer support was a mechanism to support staff. Limitations: Results might be subject to selection bias. Data collection covered a limited period of time at the early stage of the pandemic. Implications: Findings are relevant to assess the COVID-19 response and to better prepare for another COVID-19 wave or similar health or environmental threats in the future."
2278,5,"TITLE: Enablers and Barriers to Implement COVID-19 Measures in Long-Term Care Facilities: A Mixed Methods Implementation Science Assessment in Chile | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; implementation science; long-term care; nursing homes | ABSTRACT: Background: As elsewhere, in Chile the COVID-19 affected disproportionately older people, and particularly people living in long-term care facilities. Considering this problem, the Government issued a series of guidelines and protocols to prevent and manage COVID-19 outbreaks in these facilities. Methods: This study aims to identify barriers and enablers that affect the implementation of these prevention and management measures. For the analysis, we used an implementation science approach and a mixed methods strategy — a survey among facilities’ managers and interviews among staff — classifying enablers and barriers into four categories: agreement with the intervention’s goals, financial resources to implement the measures, technical needs of the intervention, and cultural factors in the facilities. Results: Results highlight the importance of the four factors above in the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and protocols. Managers and staff differ in their view of the main enablers and barriers for implementation. However, they both identify the knowledge about the measures and availability of personal protective equipment as enablers and human resources as a potential barrier. Conclusions: The identification of several factors related to goals and culture highlights the need to adopt a broad implementation approach when designing interventions for long-term care facilities, avoid-ing restricting the discussion to the availability of resources. Highlight: • Understanding implementation factors is key to design and assess successful interventions. • The prevention and management measures implemented in the Chilean facilities found barriers (e.g., infrastructure, human capital and resistance to chance), and enablers (e.g., PPE availability and trust in technical staff) that could have impacted the effectiveness of the measures proposed. • Tackling the identified implementation barriers using feasible and evidence based strategies could improve the effectiveness of the measures."

Methodology: Results were obtained using general and empirical methods, as well as different research techniques. Four of the lagoons studied are in Cayo Coco and the rest in Cayo Sabinal. Relevance: The methodological framework for this research had dynamic, comprehensive and systemic purposes with two steps: comprehensive characterization of the lagoons and their ecosystem goods and services and the calculation of the value (revenues) of these goods and services (real and potential) for each lagoon, for each territory and for the entire study area. Results: The coastal lagoons from Cayo Coco and Cayo Sabinal offer a wide variety of goods and services (fishing, beekeeping, tourism) still underestimated due to different factors. The direct and indirect use values of these lagoons represented more than 95 % (15 million Cuban pesos) of the total estimated value. Social / management contributions: the current social and economic context of Cuba and the regulatory and institutional frameworks require the use of methods and techniques for economic valuation of ecosystem goods and services, particularly those of coastal ecosystems, in correspondence with the fast development of tourism in coastal areas. For this reason, the results of this study could be a starting point to expand the valuation of ecosystem goods and service to other Caribbean and Cuban coastal lagoons."

In addition to analyzing the presentation and voting of norms related to the Afro-descendant Tribal People, we focus on the speeches of members of the Constitutional Convention regarding those norms. Through a critical discourse analysis, we identify three discursive axes that have framed the support or rejection of initiatives regarding the recognition of Afro-descendants related to the meaning of the legal category ""tribal people"", to the question of preexistence, and to Afrodescendants' ""foreignization.""The article concludes with a discussion of the positions adopted by different sectors of the convention, identifying some imaginaries that entailed limits for the inclusion of the Afro-Chilean people in the constitutional proposal."
2281,9,"TITLE: Immigration and the Boundaries of Black Political Subjecthood in Argentina and Chile | KEYWORDS: Afro-descent; ethno-racial classification; legal inclusion | ABSTRACT: In the last two decades, the Argentine and Chilean states have passed laws and policies targeting Afro-descendant populations. But while Argentine law has institutionalized Afro-descent through a broad notion of African ancestry and African-based culture, the Chilean state has legally defined Afro-descent in relation to a particular history, culture, and identity connected to a long-standing presence in the national territory. In this paper, I examine the role of immigration in explaining how Afro-descendant subjecthood has been legally constructed and institutionalized in each national context. Through archival and interview-based research, I analyze how classification struggles within each Afro-descendant movement and between Afro-descendant activists and the state frame claims and strategies for legal inclusion, ultimately impacting how the boundaries of Afro-descent are defined and institutionalized in each national context. Immigrants’ early participation within the Afro-Argentine movement promoted heterogenous political framings, but feelings of threat drove some Afro-Argentine activists to emphasize nativist claims. This has produced a diversity of legislation and policies that target different populations, including immigrants—what I refer to as a “transnational-racial” model. In Chile, immigrants have not participated prominently in the Afro-descendant movement, but they have been present in the imaginaries of activists and state officials debating legislative and policy measures. Afro-Chileans’ political success requires not being seen as foreigners by state officials, driving them to emphasize their national belonging. Thus, Black subjecthood has been institutionalized targeting Afro-Chileans who share a common history and culture while excluding immigrants—what I refer to as a “national-ethnic” model."
2282,9,"TITLE: Who is Afro-Chilean? Authenticity struggles and boundary making in Chile’s northern borderland | KEYWORDS: Afrodescendants; authenticity; boundaries; Chile; ethnic renewal; performativity | ABSTRACT: Research on Afrodescendant ethnic renewal in Latin America has mostly focused on how identities become politicized as Afrodescendants demand legal recognition, affirmative action policies and multicultural rights. This article instead directs attention to individuals’ everyday negotiations and struggles over the definition of who is authentically black and who can legitimately claim an Afrodescendant identity. Through ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews with individuals who identify as Afrodescendants in northern Chile, I look at how they construct boundaries to define membership into their community. I find that in their effort to present themselves as both Chileans and Afrodescendants, Afro-Chileans construct boundaries to distance themselves from three groups: “regular” Chileans, Aymara Indigenous people, and recently arrived black immigrants. Each boundary helps them emphasize different aspects of their local, ethnic, and national identity, promoting distinct and sometimes conflicting ways to define what it entails to be Afro-Chilean."
2283,24,"TITLE: Latin American perspectives on slow disasters | KEYWORDS: Contamination; Disaster studies; Interpretations of disasters; Latin America; Slow disasters; Slow violence | ABSTRACT: Purpose: This forum article discusses the concept of slow disasters from Latin America, presenting different perspectives and experiences of practical research using this notion. It discusses the extent to which a focus on the “slow” temporality of disasters advances our understanding of socio-environmental processes in the region. Design/methodology/approach: The article emerges from a pilot project to explore the relevance of temporality to analyse socio-environmental injustices in Latin America, which was followed by a panel organised at the 2023 NEEDS Conference in Enschede, The Netherlands, where four panellists presented first hand research experiences with the concept of slow disasters. Findings: The article presents myriad usages of slow disasters and related concepts in Latin America and includes empirical cases from Peru, Chile and Argentina, highlighting different critical dimensions of their temporalities. It shows the analytical power of slow disaster to help understand disasters as gradual processes of normalisation of environmental injustices and vulnerabilities due to the slower pace of visible material impact to affected groups and their continuous adaptation to their exposure to it. The article reflects on the potential use of this concept by Latin American scholars and contributes to applications in other regional contexts. Originality/value: The paper adds a conceptual discussion on the notion of slow disasters as reflected from different Latin American geographies. The paper contributes to ongoing strands of postcolonial disaster studies, departing from empirically grounded conceptualisations of disaster by Latin American scholars and promoting a constructive dialogue with academic debates dominated by the Anglophone scholarly literature."
2284,24,"TITLE: “Respect existence or expect … resilience?” epistemic reflexivity towards liberated disaster studies | KEYWORDS: Critical disaster studies; Critical theory; Epistemic reflexivity; Post-capitalism; Post-development; Resistance; Risk creation | ABSTRACT: Purpose: This paper proposes a way of reflexing on how we think within critical disaster studies. It focuses on the biases and unthought dimensions of two concepts – resilience and development – and reflects on the relationship between theory and practice in critical disaster studies. Design/methodology/approach: Premised on the idea of epistemic reflexivity developed by Pierre Bourdieu, and drawing on previous research, this theoretical article analyses two conceptual biases and shortcomings of disaster studies: how resilience builds on certain agency; and how development assumes certain political imagination. Findings: The article argues that critical disaster scholars must reflect on their own intellectual practice, including the origin of concepts and what they do. This is exemplified by a description of how the idea of resistance is intimately connected to that of resilience, and by showing that we must go beyond the capitalist realism that typically underlies development and risk creation. The theoretical advancement of our field can provide ways of thinking about the premises of many of our concepts. Originality/value: The paper offers an invitation for disaster researchers to engage with critical thought and meta-theoretical reflexions. To think profoundly about our concepts is a necessary first step to developing critical scholarship. Epistemic reflexivity in critical disaster studies therefore provides an interesting avenue by which to liberate the field from overly technocratic approaches and develop its own criticality."
2285,24,"TITLE: SPATIO-TEMPORAL SCALES AND THE PERSISTENCE OF A DISASTER IN THE FOOTHILLS OF SANTIAGO, CHILE ESCALAS ESPACIO-TEMPORALES Y LA PERSISTENCIA DE ‘UN DESASTRE’ EN LA PRECORDILLERA DE SANTIAGO, CHILE | KEYWORDS: Debris flow; Disasters; Santiago de Chile; Spatiotemporal scales; Urban development | ABSTRACT: In Latin America, social researchers have understood disasters as social processes. However, this does not mean that the concept of 'disaster' is univocal. Disasters are contentious processes, and moreover, the concept has particular Western roots that overlooks the situated knowledges and experiences of inhabitants of the global South. This paper aims to question the traditional contours of what we call 'disaster', following literature on critical disaster studies, and proposing an approach from different spatiotemporal scales. Focusing on a particular case (the south-east of Santiago, Chile, where the Quebrada de Macul debris flow occurred in 1993), the paper is based on qualitative ethnographic research, using data collected through interviews, participant observation and analysis of relevant documents (e.g., laws, policies, press). The results describe three spatiotemporal scales: one centered around the day of the 'event'; one on urban development; and the third, on a person's life. Each scale emphasizes different aspects and perspectives of what a disaster is. Such an approach problematizes the contours of what the literature and public policy calls 'disaster', decentering the concept in relation to conventional boundaries, and describing how multiple at-risk conditions persists in diverse experiences of actors, policies and situated practices."

A post-disaster politics of inclusion in the urban margins | KEYWORDS: Inclusive cities; Jacques Rancière; Post-disaster; Risk management; Urban governance; Urban politics | ABSTRACT: Facing climate emergency and disaster risks, cities are developing governing arrangements towards sustainability and re-silience. Research is showing the ambivalent results of these arrangements in terms of inclusion and (in)justice, as well as their outcomes in emptying the ‘properly political’ through depoliticised governing techniques. Acknowledging this post-political thesis, however, critical analyses must also engage with re-politicization and focus on disruptive and trans-formative governance efforts. This article addresses the dual dynamics of de—and re-politicisation, focusing on the in-terplay of different modes of governing urban risk. We follow the political philosophy of Jacques Rancière and related interpretations in critical urban studies to recover the politics of the city. We focus on a post-disaster area in the foothills of Santiago, Chile. After a 1993 disaster, the State constituted a mode of governing risks based on physicalist interventions that discouraged local conflicts. This techno-managerial policing order made risks invisible while favouring real estate de-velopment. However, we show how local initiatives emerge in the interstices of formal and informal arrangements that contest this course. This emerging mode of governing risk, we argue, has the potential to recover incrementally urban pol-itics and disrupt the dominant one through an egalitarian principle on the margins. Our contribution shows that, although these modes of governance coexist and are still evolving, advancing more just and inclusive cities require moving beyond consensus-based governance and focusing on the role of dissent and disruptive politics."
2289,24,"TITLE: Planning for exclusion: The politics of urban disaster governance | KEYWORDS: Chile; Disaster risk reduction; Land use planning; Post-disaster; Spatial injustice; Urban disaster; Urban governance | ABSTRACT: Many disaster risk reduction (DRR) initiatives, including land use planning, tend to ignore existing long-term inequalities in urban space. Furthermore, scholars working on urban disaster governance do not adequately consider how day-to-day DRR governing practices can (re)produce these. Hence, following a recent interest in the political dimensions of disaster governance, this article explores under what conditions the implementation of DRR land uses (re)produce spatial injustice on the ground. We develop a theoretical framework combining politics, disaster risk, and space, and apply it to a case study in Santiago, Chile. There, after a landslide disaster in the city’s foothills in 1993, a multi-level planning arrangement implemented a buffer zone along the bank of a ravine to protect this area from future disasters. This buffer zone, however, transformed a long-term established neighbourhood, splitting it into a formal and an informal area remaining to this day. Using qualitative data and spatial analysis, we describe the emergence, practices, and effects of this land use. While this spatial intervention has proactively protected the area, it has produced further urban exclusion and spatial deterioration, and reproduced disaster risks for the informal households within the buffer zone. We explain this as resulting from a governance arrangement that emerged from a depoliticised environment, enforcing rules unevenly, and lacking capacities and unclear responsibilities, all of which could render DRR initiatives to be both spatially unjust and ineffective. We conclude that sustainable and inclusive cities require paying more attention to the implementation practices of DRR initiatives and their relation to long-term inequities."

Unjustified Enrichment and the Civilian Category of Quasi- Contracts | KEYWORDS: Civil law; French Civil Code; Quasi-contract; Restitution; Unified approach; Unjust enrichment | ABSTRACT: This chapter explores the recent evolution of the notion of quasi-contract in French private law, focusing on the reasons behind its inclusion in the recent reform of the Civil Code. It shows that modern French law does not conceive the quasi-contract category as a mere collection of situations giving rise to entirely different obligations. On the contrary, the reform seems to have chosen to preserve this category out of a belief that some coherence would exist among the rules governing quasi-contractual obligations. The chapter suggests that the French experience might help to identify some of the challenges of abandoning a unified approach to obligations beyond contracts and wrongs in common law jurisdictions."
2291,10,"TITLE: Another civilian view of unjust enrichment's structural debate | KEYWORDS: civil law; quasi-contracts; restitution; unjust enrichment | ABSTRACT: This article seeks to illustrate the kinds of difficulties that may follow from renouncing a unified approach to restitutionary claims for unjust enrichment. To do so, it draws on the experience of the French legal system, where the notion of unjustified enrichment describes a maxim inspiring various doctrines which have evolved in relative isolation from each other. Relying on this experience, the article argues that the objections recently raised by Nils Jansen against the German law of unjustified enrichment should not lead English lawyers to downplay the value of a unified approach to the subject."

Exploiting discontinuous admission rules generated by Chile's centralized admission system to higher education, we identify strong sibling spillovers in the choice of college. Having an older sibling enroll in a given college increases by 42% the probability of enrolling in that institution. In contrast, we find no effect on major choices. We show evidence suggesting that sibling spillovers in college choice are mainly driven by siblings deriving benefits from attending college together."

As a result of this problem, this research focused on the relevance and value that traditional music can have as a comprehensive and interdisciplinary learning tool in formal music education. The research analyzed the implementation and results of a proposal for the sixth year of basic education with a pedagogical approach based on the idea that the music that we transfer to formal education cannot be separated from the experiences, activities, knowledge and socio-cultural implications that give them meaning in their contexts of origin. Through collaborative action research, the proposal was carried out in four centers and the perceptions of the collaborating teaching staff were analyzed. The results show that the inclusion of these types of music can enrich the learning process from an integrating conception of knowledge, considering the indivisibility of the music-context-society triad."

During the first year of this pandemic, 154 music teachers were consulted about their personal and professional situation in order to find out how they were dealing with the context of distance education. The data collected and contrasted with the bibliography consulted allow us to observe not only a modification and reinvention of their educational practices but also an important capacity for reinvention and self-motivation and an ability to move forward. These capacities are included in the concept of resilience. All of these observations lay the foundations for sensing a contextualized musical education with the ability to adapt to reality and the continuous changes that it presents and where the role of music education within the curriculum becomes in turn more important and significant, both for the student body as well as for the curriculum development of the educative system."

First, predominant educational models are described that, from a historical perspective, have determined the development of musical education in this context: ""Jesuit"" and ""conservatory"" educational models and an aesthetic-formalist paradigm. Next, the main characteristics of the praxial philosophical approach are exposed, and a theoretical perspective is constituted as an alternative to the identified predominance. This work concludes with a proposal of educational principles, which have been generated from a theoretical contrast between detected models and the praxial philosophical approach. This proposal seeks to contribute to future research as well as for pedagogical reflections, innovation processes in the curriculum as well as in didactics, methodologies, continuous teacher training, and the design and dissemination of educational resources."

Verb sociolinguistic variation —as determined by sex, age, and education level— was also examined. The main doubt expressions with an attenuating function found include doxastic verbs such as creer (“believe”) and suponer (“suppose”), the modal verbs deber (“must” or “should”) and poder (“could”, “might”), and the verb expressing lack of knowledge no saber (“to not know”). These expressions occur when speakers express their true point of view as a doubt, or when they report a state of affairs. The result is a speaker directed towards the “other”, who does not want to expose their image to their interlocutor, when the speaker expresses opinions about controversial topics or when they report facts that they prefer not to express openly. Sociolinguistic variation is scarce and is mostly related to age."

Specifically, the justifications are studied in corpora of AMERESCO and PRESEEA from Santiago, Chile, considering five dimensions: linguistic, pragmaticdiscursive, structural, enunciative and situational. The study""s main findings suggest that, even though there are similarities between the two genres studied, the mitigating strategies used to justify are used in rather characteristic ways in a determined genre, according to the type of register. Some situational factors are brought into focus, such as the thematic diversity or the equal relationship between speakers, which are regarded as key elements in the functioning of mitigating justifications."

However, there is a lack of information of its integration in the formative processes. Based on this context, it is conducted a study on the opinion about the standards on graduation and their integration into the training plan standards, according to program managers, trainers of teachers and penultimate year students from the teaching program of Playa Ancha University, 2017. The methodology consists of case studies using an explorative descriptive research. A questionnaire was applied to a sample of more than 60% of the population. The results highlight that principal and teachers’ opinion match and are more favorable than students’ in terms of knowledge, utility, attitude and intention of integrating standards. We conclude that we are at an early stage in the curricular integration of standards, while having favorable projections for the future."

It is an institutional case study, with a mixed design. At first, 78.3 percent of the Pedagogy student population participated, answering a predesigned questionnaire and, later, 13 representatives from Basic Education; and History and Geography joined a series of focus groups. The results reveal that the students asses their training from sufficient to good. There are statistically significant differences between faculties in 6 of the 10 standards. We concluded that the transversal presence of the standards in the training project during the career and the practice workshops can have a favorable influence on the training of students, whereas the lack of common guidelines between academic units results in different levels of training, a situation that must be taken into further consideration by the institution"

Using a participatory qualitative design, fifty-nine (59) seventh grade students were asked to take and then select photographs about their school experience, and later participated in semi-structured interviews and a group workshop. Findings regarding the classroom context showed that children legitimised active learning methodologies, teachers to whom they feel close, and the use of technology for learning. They delegitimised punishment and teachers who ignored minority students or those with learning difficulties."

The analysis adopts a perspective that integrates the contributions from the Appraisal Model as well as the strategy categories and social actors representation taken from the Critical Discourse Studies. The corpus is made up of three focus groups in public schools. Regarding the analysis procedures, two phases are considered. A first descriptive phase comprises a microanalysis of resources with which the students build their perspective. In the second phase, alignment and misalignment are analyzed as social practices in relation to the possibilities of the school curriculum. Findings show that students propose their own suggestions of changes and use evaluative prosodies. They work to legitimize motivational, playful, creative classes, in charge of experts and to delegitimize classes with passive methodologies and with little affectionate and motivated inspectors. The legitimation strategies make up macrostrategies of transformation of the status. The social actors are represented by means of: activation, functionalization and authorization."

Our discussion is based on findings from a year-long ethnographic study of a Transnational Youth Radio project. The analysis centers on the case of 13-year old Muhammad in the context of his school-based Barcelona radio program. We present two examples from his case that illuminate the potential and challenges of using funds of identity in highly diverse learning contexts, how the imagination is implicated in these processes, and how educators can guide the imagination to support the expansion of the learning experience. The first example describes an event in which the use of an identity artifact involving religious affiliation gave rise to intercultural tension and the foreclosure of dialogue, due to lack of guidance of the imagination related to perspective-taking. The second example focuses on a group art project, in which the cultural experience guiding the collective imagination resulted in positive identity performances, perspective-taking, and interdependence. To conclude, we propose directions for future inquiry and the design of learning environments that can guide the development of the imagination within the funds of identity framework."
2304,-1,"TITLE: From above or from below? Chilean NGOs, the State and education reforms | KEYWORDS: Chile; civil society; NGOs; political-historical analysis | ABSTRACT: The decades from the 1960s to the 1980s were prolific in the emergence of a significant and diverse movement of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Latin America. In the case of Chile, grassroots educational organisations navigated various political contexts. Initially, they played an active part in the process of social mobilisation and the emergence of new progressive trends of thought and political behaviour. Later, in reaction to the civic-military dictatorship, they were forced to adapt themselves and played an oppositional role. Drawing on the review of academic literature and interviews with researchers and activists, the article establishes a macro and meso political-historical analysis of this period. Analysis is focused on the transitions experienced by organisations, the changing role of the State and international alliances, and the different forms of linkage between governments, ideological currents, and social actors during these diverse political and social contexts."

In hand with this process of ‘NGOisation’, there has been a growing academic debate regarding the role of NGOs in terms of their influence promoting or resisting the expansion of neoliberalism. For some, NGOs are organisations that have become domesticated by neoliberalism, aiding the spread of its influence around the world; while for others, there are still some NGOs that remain critical and attempt to challenge neoliberalism. Engaging with this debate, this article critically explores the role of two advocacy NGOs involved in processes of education policymaking during the recent education reforms carried out in Chile. Drawing on Foucault’s theoretical work on governmentality, the research investigates the extent to which these NGOs contest Chilean neoliberalism or conversely, as subjects of governmentality, serve to protect and extend its hegemony. Finally, the article argues that NGOs can use their image as representatives of civil society to pacify demands for radical changes and allow the government to control the social sphere from a distance."

Based on Foucault's theoretical work on governmentality the book argues that neoliberalism as a form of governmentality has permeated in Chilean policymaking, generating new forms of domination through freedom by situating NGOs as active and responsible subjects of government. In this way, this volume contests the supposed benefits of NGOs as a force to enhance democracy and foment social participation, arguing instead, that NGOs image as representatives of civil society can be used to pacify social movements demands for radical change and build a political consensus that serves to legitimate government interests in policymaking."

While the previous Wave 1 of the MECO project (Kuperman et al., 2023) contained English as a L2 reading data from readers with 12 different first language (L1) backgrounds, the newly collected dataset adds eye-tracking data on English text reading from 13 distinct L1 backgrounds (N = 660) as well as participants’ scores on component skills of English proficiency and information about their demographics and language background and use. The paper reports reliability estimates, descriptive statistics, and correlational analyses as means to validate the expansion dataset. Consistent with prior literature and the MECO Wave 1, trends in the MECO Wave 2 data include a weak correlation between reading comprehension and oculomotor measures of reading fluency and a greater L1-L2 contrast in reading fluency than reading comprehension. Jointly with Wave 1, the MECO project includes English reading data from more than 1,200 readers representing a diversity of native writing systems (logographic, abjad, abugida, and alphabetic) and 19 distinct L1 backgrounds. We provide multiple pointers to new venues of how L2 reading researchers can mine this rich publicly available dataset."

Although the 1981 Chilean Corporations Act gives some indications, several aspects related to the procedure are indirectly or even not regulated, such as the scope of judicial discretion or the arbitrability of the conflict. In addition to these issues, the object of the process is studied, which defines the nature of the dissolution decree, who are the necessary parties, and how the execution of the judgment and corporate liquidation relate to each other."

It explores whether this remedy, devised to protect the minority shareholder against an unpredictable conflict, should be admitted when the legal form chosen was designed with the aim of encouraging investment in venture capital and, therefore, with sophisticated contract parties in mind. The dogmatic method is used, coupled with reference to the literature on incomplete contracting, in search of a criterion to determine whether and how the choice of form restricts judicial dissolution; and to apply that criterion to sole manager dispute cases. It is concluded that, among sophisticated parties, judicial dissolution should be limited to exceptional situations, while, among unsophisticated parties, should be considered available in the same cases as it would be in a corporation, whenever there are reasons that justify the choice of the sociedad por acciones form by inexperienced contract parties."

The company's manager yielded to the lawsuit. However, both the lower and appellate courts dismissed his submission, ultimately rejecting the claim. Subsequently, the Supreme Court nullified all proceedings due to a lack of proper summons. The analysis of these judicial decisions sheds light on the repercussions of breaching bylaws' restrictions on share transfers and underscores the importance of the chair of each shareholders' meeting in announcing the resolutions adopted. Furthermore, this paper explores the issue of passive standing in relation to judicial dissolution, emphasizing the need to safeguard the rights of non-suing shareholders."

The plaintiff crew brought an action for enforcement of this contract, requesting that the shipowner be ordered to pay the difference of a final liquidation of the fishing for several seasons, as well as its share in the sale of the catch quota to a third party. The commentary highlights the difficulties raised by the distinction between contracts which distributes a percentage of the profit of the business between parties, and partnerships, as well as the (contingent) place of legal entity in the latter."

The study delves into the authentic historical context of the Civil Code provisions applicable to the subject in search of their rationale, within the context of general partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and single-owned limited liability businesses. Considering that the interpretation is conditioned by the business form and that the outcome should balance the interests of both business and personal creditors, it is concluded that in general partnerships and individual businesses, the personal creditors of an insolvent partner or owner can seek the winding up of the partnership or the business. In contrast, the personal creditors of a partner in a limited liability limited partnership cannot do so, as it would disrupt the balance between the two groups of creditors."

After critically reviewing the national literature and case law, it is argued that the annotation of the agreement in the firm records and its deposit in the company in practice involve little publicity, consistent with the fact that, in the rest of the statute, the register of shareholders lacks projection towards third parties, such as an acquirer of shares. In this way, the effectiveness provided in the norm does not have a different scope from the effectiveness of civil law: Imposing the existence of the contract -not its obligatoriness- as part of the legal reality."
2319,12,"TITLE: The Serious Cause for Removing the Manager Partner Nominated in the Partnership Agreement: A Security for Investments with Specific Value | KEYWORDS: firm manager; partnership; Partnership agreement | ABSTRACT: This paper discusses the rule contained in the second paragraph of section 2072 of the Chilean Civil Code. Pursuant to this regulation, a “serious cause” is required in order to remove the partner designated as manager in the partnership agreement. The concept of “serious cause” is not defined by any statutory provision. Meanwhile, the courts and the scholarship have not agreed on a clear definition. To ascertain when a “serious cause” concurs, this paper argues that the economic rationale behind some decisions made by the partners have to be considered. These are the choice of the partnership form and the designation of a partner as its sole manager, being the latter a consequence of the presence of investments consisting in the partner-manager’s personal services, which have a specific value for the entrepreneurship. Finally, this paper describes some situations in which a “serious cause” would concur in light of the aforementioned interpretation."

The firm reported in the financial statements some long-term credits, which debtors where related companies. It did not take steps to collect them in a considerable period of time, on the grounds that they had been included into a mercantile current account with few movements. The supervisor reclassified the credits as long-term, and concluded that the financial statements contained false information. An analysis validates critically this judicial decision, and offers an alternative basis for it, built on the content of the commercial current account contract."

This investigation was carried out using the digital database “World Newspaper Archive: Historical Newspapers from Around the Globe,” reviewing all mentions of the keyword “guitar” in the newspaper during that time period. The gathered information allows us to verify the widespread presence of the instrument in various social and cultural contexts. In this way, we identified the guitarists, composers, and teachers who were most active during those years, as well as background information regarding the production and circulation of guitar music, news about concerts, and the dynamics of guitar teaching. With all this, the article aims to explore through this newspaper how the guitar was viewed in Chilean society in Valparaíso at the beginning of the 20th century, and to assess the influence of the newspaper’s notes, ads, and reviews in shaping the social perception of the instrument."

In the case of Manjón, the positive reception his concerts received went against some of the discourse in the local media, which considered the guitar vulgar and expressionless. For his part, Llobet made the ‘Tárrega School’ known in Chile in 1912. This proved a relevant milestone in the study of that school in our country. His technique was praised and, as with Manjón too, led to a questioning of the prejudices against the guitar. The case of Agustín Barrios is noteworthy since, as far as we know, he did not gain the same recognition and success as his predecessors, even though he was an outstanding guitarist and composer. Going over the events held by these artists shows that negative discourse about the guitar was widespread, leading to a specific way of understanding the development of the instrument in our country."

The implementation of such a poly-paradigmatic curriculum can occur in multiple ways. Therefore, we analyzed classroom practices with two aims: (a) to describe how the paradigms are evident across practices, and (b) to analyze the paradigms’ internal alignment within each practice. We conducted classroom observations with five Spanish language teachers with varied orientations toward writing instruction. A content analysis of teachers’ discourse formed the basis for a narrative case-by-case analysis and a cross-case analysis. This process was guided by data collected during a previous survey study and supported by teachers’ interviews. Findings revealed that the cultural, macro- and micro-linguistic paradigms were implemented most often, while the implementation of procedural and communicative paradigms was rare. Additionally, paradigm alignment was visible in two practices but not in other practices. Possible reasons for this lack of integration and potential solutions to resolve this issue are discussed."
2326,0,"TITLE: Writing to Understand and Being Understood: Basic Design Principles for Writing Instruction | KEYWORDS: Communicative function; Conditional knowledge; Design principles; Differentiation; Procedural knowledge; Writing education | ABSTRACT: In this chapter, we discuss three basic design principles for creating or redesigning effective writing lessons: initiate communication and metacommunication, demonstrate procedures, and differentiate. These principles should guide the (re)design process and can be used for describing and evaluating instructional units. We consider these principles to be basic knowledge for language teachers, although the ability to implement them with maximum effect will take some years of professionalization via experience in practice and in-service training to obtain. We sketch three consecutive developmental phases in teacher development. We will demonstrate the generic power of these three principles using cases we distilled from classroom practices in Chile and intervention studies designed and tested by teacher-researchers in the Netherlands. We conclude that the essence of writing lessons - understanding and being understood - is not often realized. Having access to the outcomes of research-based interventions can support in-service programs to help teachers move through these three developmental phases and become more experienced writing educators."
2327,0,"TITLE: Teachers’ Writing Practices and Contextual Features in Grades 7-12 of Chilean Public Schools | KEYWORDS: curriculum; secondary education; Spanish; survey; writing instruction | ABSTRACT: Since 2010, efforts have been made in Chile to support students’ writing skills development, in order to better prepare them for participation in modern society. However, more knowledge about current practices of writing instruction in Grades 7-12 is needed to guide future improvements in these educational levels. We aimed to provide a context–based picture of paradigms of writing instruction which are currently being implemented in Grades 7-12 of Chilean public schools. With this goal, we surveyed teachers of Spanish (n= 182) from all Chilean regions. Results revealed that teachers mostly implement practices related to the linguistic, cultural and procedural paradigms of writing instruction, while the communicative paradigm appeared to be less coherent and less strongly implemented. We recommend that future public efforts focus on diminishing teachers’ workload and providing them with adequate support for their needs in the classroom, especially for teachers working in Grades 9-12. This study can provide guidance to the international community of literacy researchers by presenting the state of the art of Chilean teachers’ practices in relation to its contextual background. This, in turn, can contribute to the construction of a broad view of the requirements for high quality writing instruction across the world."

The analysis considers two approaches in the study of Latin American religion: (1) the monopoly that Catholicism has had since the colonial period to the recent increase of religious pluralism (i.e. the spread of Protestantism – Pentecostalism – and other religious expressions) and (2) the religious syncretism and heterodox religious practices outside the official religion. In addition, the research identifies a third trend: the role of immigrant religion in the revitalisation and cultural diversification of national parishes. This latter approach has been understood as a current phenomenon that produces national parishes integrated by Chileans and immigrants in the Chilean context."

The main objectives try to identify (a) the reproduction of Haitian Catholicism in a Chilean parish and (b) the interrelationship with the Chilean community and society through participation in the parish life by Haitian parishioners. The research uses a qualitative framework with participant observations of the Sunday Masses and religious and social activities developed in the parish. The sample is composed of Haitian parishioners that are regular participants of the Masses and activities. The main findings show that the Haitian community is not alone or isolated from Chilean parishioners and society. The participation in ‘integration’ Masses and cultural activities are examples of activities for both Haitians and Chileans. Finally, the language is a tool for remembering the Haitian Mass but not a mechanism for isolating the Haitian community."

However, by analysing 739 innovation projects in the Norwegian global salmon farming industry, we find that the four ideal GIS configurations can be identified simultaneously. We argue that this is because we refer to an industry with a large diversity of innovation projects generating different resources along varied scales of interaction. Our analysis is based on text analysis of descriptive documents and interviews about innovation projects. With this information, we built four GIS configurations that illustrate how actors, networks and institutions form and are connected through different types of subsystems. The purpose is to understand why some actors have diverse priorities when participating in different types of innovation projects within the same industry and suggest relevant policy ideas."

The criteria for responding to this question are set by different organisations, since the concept of sustainable aquaculture is a social construction and there are no agreed criteria for establishing this sustainability condition and its evolution. Using an historical political ecology perspective, this paper unravels the evolution of this social construction over the past 50 years in order to establish how sustainability, responsibility, and sustainable development have been (re)constructed over time in response to changing demands. These constructions are traced through scientific publications, business reports, international organisation literature, and in terms of regulatory and consumer pressures. The documents provide evidence of the ways in which the sector evolved a particular conception of sustainability alongside the emerging global agenda set in motion by the Stockholm Conference of 1972, precisely at a time when the collapse of many capture fisheries became evident and aquaculture was presented as a more sustainable alternative. The conclusions point to the importance, for the sector, of restricting the sustainability concept to a narrow definition of business responsibility based on eco-efficiency, bio-security, and innovation, and separating this responsibility from the broader-based concept of sustainable development promoted by most UN agencies, governments, and NGOs."

Middle-income countries such as Chile look at video games and other service sectors as viable industries to promote in the context of their economies, which currently rely on high specialisation in the extraction of natural resources and low value-added manufacturing products. However, a question must be asked: is the video games sector in Chile in danger of repeating similar patterns of dependency showed by those extractive-based industries? The following article explores this issue, deploying a Latin American dependency theory perspective combined with new insights from cognitive capitalism literature. Two main contributions derive from the analysis. First, the use of dependency theory and related literature is still valuable when it comes to understanding the conditions of technological dependency in highly-innovative sectors. Secondly, the analysis of video games sector development in Chile in itself contributes to digital games research and economic geography, as peripheral territories such as Chile are frequently ignored in the ongoing critical and policy discourse of creative/digital industries. Deploying semi-structured interviews with Chilean game developers and governmental agencies, the article evidence forms of dependency on the use of non-proprietary technological tools (game engines and software development kits – SDKs) and the protection of intellectual property (IP) in the centre (publishing schemes)."
2333,-1,"TITLE: Video games development in the periphery: cultural dependency? | KEYWORDS: Chile; Cultural dependency; Dependency theory; Immaterial labour; Latin America; Periphery | ABSTRACT: Video games developers engage with their creations, and games in general, in profoundly emotional ways. Since the industry became a mass-market phenomenon, a growing body of research has emerged interrogating the connections between developers and the games they produce and how these connections relate to broader affective issues seen in the cultural and creative industries. Most of the research in this field focuses on core markets such as the United States (US), Europe and Japan, leaving a significant gap of empirical research in peripheral locations. While emotional and affective issues are also present in peripheral games development, games production in these locations is often influenced by core-like global cultural tropes. Drawing on ideas and concepts about immaterial labour and based on semi-structured interviews, the analysis shows that many Chilean developers often see Japanese and North American games as the primary source of inspiration. As a result, the periphery’s games are essentially locked into the tropes, themes, and core markets’ characters. While this might be viewed as disadvantageous, Chilean developers have identified this trait as a major strength when competing in the global game market."

Accordingly, export specialization patterns in Chile must be analyzed on a regional scale to understand the relationships between export diversification, economic growth and dependency. We analyze how the degree of export specialization among Chile's regions is linked to regional GDP growth and to regional export growth. Moreover, by taking a long-term perspective, we can evaluate these relationships during a phase of strong national currency and in the context of an external ""shock"". Our analysis applies the theoretical frameworks of the 'resource curse' and 'Dutch disease' on a regional geographical scale.We identify a tendency towards increased export specialization that is linked in part to high volatility of both GDP growth and export growth. There is also evidence of a growing dependence of Chilean regional economies on export trade. The 1991-2010 period covered by the analysis provides evidence of how external factors, such as high commodity prices and low US dollar exchange rates, foster specialization and weaken non-mineral exports in relative terms, especially in the highly specialized mineral-based regions of Chile. This result is consistent with the application of the Dutch disease thesis on a regional scale. Our analysis also shows the negative short-term effect of an external demand crisis on the mineral export sector and on highly specialized regions. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for a regional perspective on exports and on the effects of external factors within the country. © 2014."

We evaluate the impact of a free digital stress management and positive parenting intervention designed to improve caregiver's mental health and positive caregiver–child interactions in El Salvador. Drawing on the prior success of in-person interventions, we study the effects of digital intervention delivery and examine differential treatment effects by caregiver's sex. Using an individual-level experiment, we find that the intervention increased stress and anxiety and lowered caregiver–child interactions among male caregivers. In contrast, among female caregivers, we did not detect changes in mental health and observed a decrease in the use of physical violence against children. We also find that family structure and the severity of economic deprivation greatly moderated the intervention's impact, especially among male caregivers. Our findings indicate that one-size-fits-all digital parenting interventions may not serve all caregivers effectively, emphasizing the need for thorough evaluations prior to extensive implementation."

We find a 30% decrease in robberies when the DST transition increases the amount of sunlight by 1 h during the 7-9 p.m. period. We document a symmetric reaction when DST decreases sunlight exposure. We complement these findings by showing that the response induced by DST is not associated with a plausible demand-side response such as the population's commuting patterns and we find no substantial short-term displacement of crime. Our results show that ambient light is a key driver of criminal activity in urban spaces."

Exploiting the timing of a Chilean public transportation reform and detailed administrative data, I show how victims’ propensity to resist an attack can alter the level and nature of criminal activity. I also find a large decline in crime after the implementation of a technological innovation that eliminated cash trans-actions on buses. My results suggest a strong relationship between victim incentives, cash, and crime."
2338,5,"TITLE: Employment Loss in Informal Settlements during the Covid-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Chile | KEYWORDS: Covid-19; Employment; Informal settlements; Poverty; Spatial inequalities | ABSTRACT: The Covid-19 pandemic has reached almost every corner of the world. Despite the historical development, approval, and distribution of vaccines in some countries, non-pharmaceutical interventions will remain an essential strategy to control the pandemic until a substantial proportion of the population has immunity. There is increasing evidence of the devastating social and economic effects of the pandemic, particularly on vulnerable communities. Individuals living in urban informal settlements are in a structurally disadvantaged position to cope with a health crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Estimates of this impact are needed to inform and prioritize policy decisions and actions. We study employment loss in informal settlements before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in Chile, using a longitudinal panel study of households living in Chile’s informal settlements before and during the health crisis. We show that before the pandemic, 75% of respondents reported being employed. There is a decrease of 30 and 40 percentage points in May and September 2020, respectively. We show that the employment loss is substantially higher for individuals in informal settlements than for the general population and has particularly affected the immigrant population. We also show that the pandemic has triggered neighborhood cooperation within the settlements and that targeted government assistance programs have reached these communities in a limited way. Our results suggest that individuals living in informal settlements are facing severe hardship as a consequence of the pandemic. In addition to providing much-needed support, this crisis presents a unique opportunity for long-term improvements in these marginalized communities."

We also review existing studies devoted to estimating the costs of specific crimes. We offer a brief discussion categorizing the alternative costs of crime and the various methodological approaches taken (hedonic analysis, contingent valuation, and accounting methods), with an explicit discussion of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach and debates within the economics profession pertaining to these methodologies. We argue that cost considerations broadly defined should be of central importance in criminal justice policy debates. However, we also highlight the potential for cost-consideration and important equity criteria to come into conflict. Policy Implications: Policy makers should consider careful cost-benefit analysis as an important criterion in criminal justice policy. Given some features of criminal justice policy choices such as the unequal distribution of the costs of criminal victimization, anti-crime enforcement, and the potential for perceived illegitimacy of the criminal justice system to undermine various public institutions, we argue that equity considerations also deserve careful attention. In practice, we place greater confidence in the use of cost-of-crime estimates to judge the relative effectiveness of alternative interventions, and we are cautious regarding policy prescriptions emanating from benefit-cost ratios that are marginally greater than one."

However, there is a notable dearth of studies investigating these connections specifically within the context of adolescents dealing with parental divorce. Objective: This study examined both direct and indirect associations between parental attachment during adolescence and subjective well-being mediated by self-esteem among individuals dealing with parental divorce. Method: A total of 204 adolescents (female: n = 83; mean age = 14.43 years, SD = 1.55) whose parents were divorced were recruited for this study and completed a self-administered questionnaire including measures of parental attachment, self-esteem, and subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive and negative affect). Results: A structural equation model revealed the following for adolescents whose parents had undergone divorce: (a) There was a significant positive association between maternal (although not paternal) attachment and subjective well-being. (b) Self-esteem mediated the association of maternal attachment with subjective well-being. (c) These associations were not moderated by the participants' assigned sex at birth. Note: Throughout this article, we use the noun sex to refer to the sex assigned at birth (boy or girl, man or woman), for economy of language. Conclusion: We emphasize the significance of nurturing secure parent–adolescent attachments and cultivating enhanced self-esteem as potential avenues to bolster the well-being of adolescents navigating the challenges posed by parental divorce. Implications: These findings have impact for the understanding of the attachment–well-being dynamics involved after parental divorce among adolescents."

The goal of the current longitudinal study (N = 547 youth) was to understand how teaching practices and perceptions of the classroom environment shape expressed intellectual humility in middle school students. In multilevel Bayesian analyses with informative priors, mastery-oriented teaching practices predicted changes in perceived mastery goal structure, which in turn predicted changes in expressed intellectual humility over one school year. The classroom environment in the first school year also predicted changes in expressed intellectual humility in the next school year. These findings suggest classrooms that emphasize learning for learning's sake can precipitate changes in adolescents’ willingness to express intellectual humility."
2342,0,"TITLE: How to Measure Quality of Delivery: Focus on Teaching Practices That Help Students to Develop Proximal Outcomes | KEYWORDS: Implementation; measure; quality of delivery; theory of change | ABSTRACT: Recent studies have suggested that quality of delivery matters to achieve better student outcomes in the context of school interventions. However, studies rarely measure quality of delivery and test its association with students’ outcomes, perhaps due to lack of clarity regarding how to measure it. Here, we offer recommendations on how to select or design measures of quality of delivery. These recommendations focus on identifying teaching practices that help students to develop proximal outcomes during the delivery of an intervention. Additionally, we illustrate an application of these recommendations to the study of quality of delivery in a cluster-randomized efficacy study of Brainology, a program that promotes students’ motivation and learning. We found that, although teachers fluctuated in their quality of delivery across lessons, students who received the intervention with higher quality of delivery on average increased more in targeted proximal outcomes (effort beliefs and learning goals) than students exposed to low quality. We discuss these results in terms of their implications for measuring quality of delivery, supporting teachers, and studying the conditions that make school interventions successful."

In developing this thesis, Carmelo Galioto employs a phenomenological approach in considering the place and role of religion in public schools. First, he reconstructs the prevailing liberal arguments regarding the purpose of teaching religion in public schools. Second, drawing on some of Edith Stein's claims, he proposes that public schools contribute not only to the development of civic friendship and critical thinking, but also to existential purposes. Third, he presents how Simone Weil's reflections help us to see the connection between teaching religion in public schools and accomplishing important existential and spiritual purposes. Finally, Galioto details how teaching religion serves as a key element in the existential and spiritual development of students, taking into account various issues related to this educational aim. The phenomenological approach, he concludes, contributes to a specific conception of religion as an educational subject in the public school system, one focused on teaching about and from religions."

However, in a time of conspicuous privatisation and pluralism, the value and meaning of the public sphere in education are in dispute with other value preferences. This paper offers a phenomenological account of the discussion that took place in Chile's Constitutional Convention, which represents an interesting case study due to the country's background of extensive privatisation of education. The main themes that revealed the spheres of values in dispute in this respect revolved around: the public function of the State, the public arena and its relationship with freedom of education and the diversity of educational projects, and finally the relationship between the public arena and the preferences of families. The paper describes the value controversies implicit in this debate and explains the philosophical foundations that enable us to continue questioning what constitutes the public dimension of education."
2346,0,"TITLE: Teaching religion in the Chilean school system: Problems and perspectives from a philosophical approach La clase de religión en el sistema escolar de Chile: problemas y perspectivas desde una aproximación filosófica | KEYWORDS: philosophy of education; public school system; religion; secularization | ABSTRACT: The presence of religion in the curriculum of a public school system is a controversial topic. This paper offers a hermeneutic analysis of Decree 924/83, the primary regulatory instrument overseeing the role of religion in schools and higher education in Chile. The aim is to uncover its principal challenges and propose new perspectives grounded in philosophical arguments. Specifically, three critical nodes are identified that arise from the interpretation of Decree 924/83 in its text and implementation: exclusivism, confessionalism, and (possibly) religious illiteracy. To overcome these challenges, a new approach is proposed, suggesting that religious classes be presented as a universal, mandatory, and non-denominational educational asset. Finally, we offer some implications for future academic research and public policy regarding the presence of religious education in the Chilean school system."

First, the article presents ‘Via Pulchritudinis [The way of beauty]: paths of evangelisation and dialogue,’ published by the Pontifical Council for Culture (2006) [http://www.cultura.va/content/cultura/en/pub/documenti/ViaPulchritudinis.html]. Through three lines of argument concerning nature, art, and Christ as the model and prototype of Christian beauty, Via Pulchritudinis proposes that beauty is a crucial dimension of evangelisation. Building on contemporary educational research, the article introduces different meanings of beauty that converge with Via Pulchritudinis and explore their pedagogical implications. Second, the article describes a school example that includes six figures, showing how Catholic schools can incorporate beauty within everyday tasks. Finally, the article offers pedagogical guidelines to motivate Catholic schools to follow the way of beauty: to develop dialogues around the understanding and experience of beauty, consider the school environment as an expression of holistic beauty, integrate the aesthetic dimension into the whole curriculum, and cultivate a beautiful liturgy."

Problems and potentialities in experiences of temporality in school | KEYWORDS: justice; phenomenology; school; Temporality | ABSTRACT: This paper problematizes the experience of temporality in school education and explores its potentialities, examining the implications for educational justice in and for qualitative research. In a first stage, we develop a pars destruens of how the experience of temporality takes place as a transversal dimension of school activities. Using phenomenological perspective as theoretical and critical lens, we show that the objective of this approach is to organize time and experience in a standardized, contradictory, and tense manner; at the same time, we describe a pars construens of the experience of temporality, endowed with a horizon of possibilities: the school as free time that contributes to questioning certain aspects in relation to temporality as a project of progress in education, without failures, without different rhythms. These approaches propose a link between experience of temporality and educational justice that we discuss in the conclusion."

Understanding the concept of meaning as polysemic, inclusive, and pre-theoretical, a study was conducted involving students, families, teachers, and administrators within a rural school community in Chile. This study aimed to explore the diverse meanings attributed to the school by these educational actors. Employing a case study approach, the research utilized semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and reflective journals to capture spontaneous thoughts, revealing an analytical tension between socio-historical and personal meanings. The study identified and examined the technification of learning as a dominant socio-historical meaning, which has led to dissatisfaction among the teaching staff and school leadership. Additionally, the research uncovered two personal meanings— the pursuit of a vital pedagogy and the prioritization of care within the school experience—neither of which has successfully evolved into socio-historical meanings. The study concludes with a discussion that underscores the theoretical and research potential of questioning the meaning of school."
2350,0,"TITLE: Towards a reform of religious teaching in the Chilean school system | KEYWORDS: Chile; Public education; Religion; Religious education | ABSTRACT: This essay proposes to change the current manner by which religion is taught within the Chilean school system. Currently, all schools are legally compelled to offer a particular religious teaching in a confessional fashion, although exemptions are offered on an individual basis; whilst state-owned or private secular schools must choose a religion from a list of alternatives (usually Catholicism), private faith schools only teach about the religious belief that defines their educational project. As it stands, this scheme generates problems of exclusivism (students only learn about one faith), confessionalism (they are directed to believe in said faith), and religious illiteracy (in cases where they are allowed to opt-out from the religion class). After characterising religious learning as an educational good for anthropological, cultural, existential, and civic reasons, we propose a move towards a scheme of universal (all faiths), mandatory (no exemptions), and non-confessional (non-directive) religious teaching for state schooling (UMNC). Finally, we propose extending UMNC to faith schools, for reasons related to the epistemic and axiological place of the religion class within the curriculum, and a shift from concerns about parental rights to a child-centred approach."

Then, I explore implications: First, based on the symbolism of the Incarnation as act of weaving, I consider education as a set of processes that allows the emergence of the divine-human vocation; second, studying can be conceived as a tool for a comprehensive weaving of a person’s true self. I discuss the validity of the implications of this perspective."

Using a conceptual history approach allowed us to analyse the meanings attributed to the concept of quality in the design and implementation of two evaluation systems: The Educational Quality Assessment System (SECE, Spanish initials) and the Educational Quality Measurement System (SIMCE, Spanish initials). The findings show a transformation in meaning for the concept of quality. It moved from the operationalisation, management, and improvement of school systems to equating quality with the results of educational evaluations. This new definition of quality resulted from decisions by the Chilean State, which simplified its complexity and helped manage the new school system. An implication of this semantic transformation is the understanding of quality as a tool used to rank schools."

L’esperienza scolastica come opportunità di formazione integrale dell’individuo | KEYWORDS: Education; Formation; Personal Individuality; Phenomenology; School | ABSTRACT: What importance do we recognize to the relationship between education and individuality in today’s educational institutions? Recent educational policy choices are increasingly focused on proposing curricula based on the skills to be acquired, (standard) action parameters for schools and on the use of “accountability” devices aimed at verifying the achievement of expected results. Following a similar ap-proach, the individuality of each appears as a neglected element. In this article, the link between education and individuality in school curricula is addressed, according to a phenomenological perspective. The starting point outlines a synthetic picture of the ways in which the philosophy of contemporary education thematizes the issue; then, in a second part, it develops a phenomenological description of the relationship between education and individuality such as to integrate and broaden the contribu-tions of today’s philosophy of education. The article concludes by showing some implications aimed at rethinking the school experience as an opportunity for integral education and suggests indications for possible further research."

Contemporary educational policies for school systems emphasize the evaluation of educational quality through results obtained from standardized tests or performance indicators. Purpose. To develop a problematization of the operationalization and standardization of the notion of quality in school education, taking as a case study the decision of the Chilean Educational Quality Agency to introduce indicators of personal and social development. Discussion. The essay uses the notion of audit culture from the socio-anthropological literature and the reflections of Hannah Arendt in order to problematize the use of indicators in the field of educational policies for primary and secondary schools. In the first instance, it is argued that these evaluation indicators are framed in what the scientific literature has defined as an “audit culture” and, in particular, in an aspect of it that has been coined as the “indicator game.” In the second instance, it is argued that these indicators are insufficient to account for personal and social development; this is shown by proposing a substantive definition of school education obtained from Hannah Arendt: a phenomenon that inserts the novelty represented by the students into the world. Conclusions. These measurement indicators of quality inevitably reduce the phenomenon to be measured. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the attention of educational policies to a substantive aspect such as personal and social development can be used to discuss what school education we are thinking about and designing."

Using the conceptual history approach, we recognized three layers of significance of the concept: quality linked to the reorganization of the school system; quality conceived as an effect of the school on the learning of the students, and quality as a result of performance measurements with their interpretations and possible use of these results. Around this last stratum, a dispute arose between political decision-makers and technical experts in measuring instruments, understood exclusively in terms of school performance, and leaving aside a broader sense of quality that goes beyond measured performance. Finally, after the historical reconstruction, we identify the logic underlying these layers of significance and we mention some implications of the historical findings for the study of the role that the concept of quality plays in contemporary educational policies."

The focus of this theoretical exercise is the conception of knowledge that underlies the indicators of educational quality, in order to discuss its fundamental principles and limits. In the first part, we developed a general description of accountability and its epistemological assumptions, taking as a reference the Chilean case, that justify its internal coherence, as well as a supposed objectivity, referring to measurement and performance standards. In the second section, we critically discussed this notion of objectivity from epistemological approaches as contemporary physics and phenomenology. In conclusion, we presented some implications and guidelines for quality assurance in educational policies."

First, based on magisterial documents, the text identifies three features that characterise this integration: a comprehensive understanding of knowledge, a testimony offered through the lives of teachers, and an approach to Catholic schools as a ‘community laboratory’. Second, the paper exemplifies the integration of faith, culture and life through a secondary school mathematics class. This example allows manifesting those three features in concrete pedagogical practice. Finally, the paper provides orientations that can foster the integration of faith, culture and life in Catholic Schools. These guidelines are related to: promoting teaching-learning experiences based on analogy, discussing the understanding of knowledge that runs through the school curriculum, articulating the pedagogical principles that guide teachers’ work, and guaranteeing institutional commitment to transform the school into a community laboratory."

Another tool that would help improve educational delivery quality is the Service-Learning methodology that enables students to experience hands-on learning by working with real-life cases and firms. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a significant challenge in many areas, and education has not been an exception. Most educational institutions have moved from traditional brick-and-mortar to online or hybrid modern settings. However, teachers and students were not prepared for that significant movement, uncertain about how to deliver and receive it, respectively. Educational institutions faced issues developing competencies with teachers into students effectively. Research Questions: The research question is whether the application of the Agile and Service-Learning methodologies in a software engineering-related course of the 'Ingeniería en Información y Control de Gestión' major at the Universidad Catolica del Norte in Chile would make a positive impact in both students and partners. Methodology: A mixed-methods approach with quantitative and qualitative analysis was used to understand and evaluate the underlying situation and outcomes. Findings: Our findings show that this setup of Service-Learning and agile framework increased teamwork, time management, and overall work satisfaction through a case study conducted in the course. Students positively evaluated the setting of goal expectations with community partners (i.e., an SME) and other critical learning aspects. Also, the community partners were more satisfied with the product delivery."

This study aims to investigate forms of concentration, such as the communicational flow of digital media, to determine the opportunities and information defects of these media due to regulatory deficiencies in this sector. Data collection was carried out through a qualitative and quantitative methodology. The prospect of the imminent constituent process in Chile provides the opportunity to evaluate possibilities and propose changes not only at the legislative level but also at the constitutional level, which are likely to provide benefits such as freedom of expression, with greater guarantees toward the pluralism of digital media. The latter also means assessing the relevance of enshrining the right to communication in the future."

However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of these programs. This paper evaluates one of these programs, Centros de Emprendimiento ChileCompra in Chile. This initiative has a dual mandate – to serve as a primary vehicle for national procurement and to serve as a microenterprise support program. The microenterprise support component consists of regional centers that provide entrepreneurs with training in business plan development, financing, and taxation to enable greater participation among microenterprises in the public procurement market. Using 8 years of panel data on program contracts from 2007 to 2014, we assess the impact of ChileCompra's microenterprise participation component with regards to the share of the total business and the share of revenues. Our results indicate that the program resulted in an increased share of contracts going to microenterprises at the national level, but that results were uneven at the local level. In many cases, contrary to the policy's goals, the share of microenterprises receiving contracts through ChileCompra declined substantially."

Few researchers have compared the SE sector before and after the occurrence of a significant financial crisis, especially in developed countries. This paper analyzes the determinants of entry into self-employment during the 2008 Spanish Crisis. Using data from the Encuesta de Presupuesto Familiar (EPF), results show that although the rate of SE did not experience a significant change during this time, the crisis affected people differently based on gender, with females being more affected than males. Results also suggest differences between Comunidades Autonomas in how the self-employment sector behaved during the crisis."

It analyzes the practices that re-create and configure in the twenty-first century forms of inserting and rooting themselves in the receiving countries, through transformations and continuities that lead to the configuration of possible futures. We focus on how migrants re-constitute themselves as subjects based on a series of ways of being and belonging in more than one nation-state, and how they navi-gate towards horizons of security, well-being, and recognition by exploring strategies that link nodes, flows, structures, and processes over long distances that imply immediacy, simultaneity, and participation in different interacting circuits. Four dimensions of analysis are considered: a) dynamics of organization and collective action, b) visibility of cultural practices in the formation of communities, c) construction of creative resources, and d) individual strategies for possible futures. Accordingly, a series of ethnographic findings are presented in which subjectivities are made visible as daily experiences projected by migrants in transnational scenarios. Finally, it is important to highlight the multi-sited approach as a methodological strategy in analyzing and interpreting migratory phenomena over long geographic distances."
2363,9,"TITLE: Humble dreams: cementing futures in an indigenous region of Mexico Sonhos humildes: cimentar futuros numa região indígena do México | KEYWORDS: cement; future; house; humble dreams; migration; social change | ABSTRACT: This article explores “humble dreams” as a local model of an imagined future, emerging from diverse and historically situated conversations that build common sense and enable people to imagine other possible lives and engage with them in the present. Based on this idea, an experience of social change is explored in the Mezquital Valley, a Mexican indigenous population that, during the 20th century , was described by anthropology as the poorest and socioculturally most backward indigenous region of Mexico. The author focuses on a concrete expression of those “humble dreams”: the construction of the cement house, that was installed early on as the main aspiration for the workers who left the region to earn a living. The construction of the cement house allowed and allows temporary learnings related to the link between present and future, as well as forms of belonging to the communities that enable those who “ andan lejos ” to continue being part of their communities."

Approaches in anthropology that focus on the temporality of migration have recently warned that, in contemporary global circumstances, migration projects, particularly those of irregular migrants, seem to be marked by waiting and by the temporary suspension of their resolution. Such studies tend to emphasize the migrants’ experience of time, subjected to a chronopol-itics conditioned by the bureaucratic management of migration. In this paper, based on an ethnographic approach developed between 2012 and 2019 in Otomí-Hñahñu indigenous communities in the Mezquital Valley, in central Mexico, I follow anthropological concerns about the temporality of migration and waiting. However, I propose an alternative path to the one that has been developed in recent literature on the subject. At the same time, I explore the multiple ways in which the uncertain time of migration is managed among the communities of origin. I propose that these migrants co-participate in the migration project and its temporalities, by engaging in concrete practices to manage absence and waiting times. The Mezquital Valley communities, which have experienced intense migration to the United States since the end of the last century, are currently communities in waiting. A wait that, although marked by the chronopolitics of migration, does not cease to identify its promise for the future and temporarily steer migratory projects."

The evaluation process requires the engagement of multiple actors in order to collect knowledge of their experiences and to inform future design and implementation of adaptation responses. A case study was conducted in four counties of the Aconcagua Valley, Chile, to evaluate the usefulness of existing drought response measures, and to identify strengths and weaknesses, and relevant actors’ recommendations for overcoming them. We applied the Index for the Usefulness of Adaptation Practices (IUPA), a multi-criteria tool that systematically identifies the perceived usefulness of measures. The most salient strengths of the evaluated measures were: replicability, pertinence, and efficacy; representing key factors that could facilitate the implementation of drought responses in similar contexts. The most salient weaknesses were: lack of integration with other policy domains and projects, low environmental protection, diminished autonomy in decision-making, and inequity. Proposed recommendations to overcome these weaknesses have real potential for implementation because they emerged from local actors. Results present empirical evidence of the utility of participatory approaches for a context-specific evaluation of measures, contributing to enhance adaptation to climate variability and change."

2368,9,"TITLE: Racism and food delivery platforms: shaping migrants’ work experiences and future expectations in the United Kingdom and Chile | KEYWORDS: digital work; discrimination; food delivery; Gig economy; migration; racism | ABSTRACT: Recent studies have demonstrated that platform work is predominately undertaken by migrant workers. Drawing on a qualitative study of platform-based food delivery work in Chile and the United Kingdom, we examine how migrant workers’ experiences of race and ethnicity shape their working conditions and future job prospects in the platform economy. In both countries, migrants perceived platform work to be a way of avoiding forms of racism in the formal economy. However, while in the United Kingdom this type of work lived up to migrants’ expectations of providing an environment with fewer overt forms of racism, in Chile, workers experienced high levels of everyday racism when performing platform work. We argue that processes of racialisation have a direct impact on the labour conditions of workers in the gig economy, and that race and migration background play a key role in migrants’ labour trajectories."
2369,9,"TITLE: Racialized Representations of Migrants by the Local Police in Chile | KEYWORDS: institutional racism; migration; police; racialization | ABSTRACT: In this article, we explore the racialized construction of migrants by the Carabineros, the Chilean national police. Based on a qualitative case study, we show that the representations of Latin American and Caribbean migrants by members of this institution are racialized and mostly framed on ideas of a historically constructed superiority. Drawing on interviews with police personnel from different units in Santiago, Chile, we show how the historical state racist policies on migration and systemic institutional racism are embedded in the Carabineros’ discourse, who represent the state and law in their everyday interactions with migrants. Historically, this institution continues to be a strongly hierarchical and militarized police force, whose mission has been to defend territorial integrity and the moral, socio-historical, and cultural national identity, as well as to uphold the most important values of the so-called Chilenidad. We argue that the Chilean police frame their racialized representations of Latin American and Caribbean migrants within systemic institutional racism and socio-historical tropes, particularly from racialized, class, and moral perspectives that reproduce anti-immigrant sentiments and illustrate the ways in which migrants have been historically criminalized and treated in everyday life."

This article describes platform work in Chile, especially in the context of COVID-19, which has highlighted the essential role of geographically tethered digital platforms in facilitating essential goods and services in times of social distancing and quarantine. While the gig economy has provided employment for those outside traditional labor markets, its supposedly ‘collaborative’ employment structures obscure the different costs of precarity and informality transferred from platforms to workers (Ravenelle, 2019). Based on 35 interviews with gig workers using the Fairwork framework to evaluate working conditions in the gig economy, this article examines digital labor relations, both on paper and in reality; the conditions and limitations gig workers face daily; and their perceptions regarding such platforms. We discuss the contradictory experiences felt by platform workers, dependent on the platform in some ways, and independent in others. We argue that the inherently contradictory conditions and circumstances of platform work have become even more salient for gig workers in the context of COVID-19: risks increasingly fall on workers as platforms continue to stress their ‘choice’ to do so. This article reveals that the nature of the linkage between platform and worker is eminently a labor relationship, with clearly established elements of worker dependence."

In the case of the Global South, the pandemic has developed along with growing South-South migratory movements, becoming another key factor that might reinforce social conflict in increasingly multicultural areas as migrants have historically served as “scapegoats” for unexpected crises as a way to control and manage diversity. Chile is one of the main destination countries for migrants from the Latin American and Caribbean region, and COVID-19 outbreaks in migrant housing have intensified discrimination. In such a context, there is a need for understanding how the pandemic has potentially changed the way non-migrants perceive and interact with migrant neighbors. Drawing on the national social cohesion panel survey study ELSOC (2016–2021, N = 2,927) the aim is to analyze the changes in non-migrants' attitudes toward migrants—related to dimensions of social cohesion—over the last years and their relation with individual status and territorial factors. We argue that social cohesion in increasingly multicultural societies is partially threatened in times of crisis. The results indicate that after the pandemic, convivial attitudes toward Latin American migrants decreased. Chileans started perceiving them more negatively, particularly those respondents with lower educational levels and who live in increasingly multicultural neighborhoods with higher rates of migrant residents."

It contributes to regional racial studies by analyzing how whiteness is constructed in multicultural neighborhoods where different national and racialized identities that share a colonial past converge, and where the nation-state has historically pursued a progressive whitening through the adoption of racist state policies. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, I show how Chileans construct a white racial identity vis-à-vis the presence of, and through ordinary interactions with, Latin American and Caribbean migrants. As is the case elsewhere, in contemporary Chile whiteness is an ongoing everyday social construct that is not only conveyed as a discourse, but also through the practice or performance of power in the social textures of urban life. Making and enacting whiteness becomes a way in which racial hierarchies of belonging are materialized to achieve a higher status in an unequal racialized society. This study reveals how Chileans claim to be ‘white(r)’ than the South-South migrants they interact with, reproducing a Chilean hegemonic discourse about national identity, through the many practices of everyday life. The article’s main argument is that making whiteness through these ordinary occurrences reproduces anti-indigenous and anti-black racism."

This article explores the historical, complex entanglements between ‘race’, disease, and dirtiness in the multicultural Chilean context of Covid-19. We conducted a quantitative content analysis and a discourse analysis of online readers’ comments (n = 1233) in a digital news platform surrounding a controversial news event to examine Chileans’ cultural representations of Haitian migrants and explore online racism and anti-immigrant discourse. Drawing on a decolonial approach, we argue that Covid-19 as a crisis has been fabricated at the expense of a constructed ‘other’. We show how colonial racist logics not only endure in digital spaces, but are made viral in new ways by representing Haitian migrants as ‘filthy’ and ‘disease carriers’. We identified two contemporary forms of racism – online cultural racism and online aggressive racism – through which people construct imaginaries of racial superiority in digital spaces."

The aim of this article is to explore social coexistence in residential neighbourhoods in the context of South-South migration, in order to examine the multiple factors at play behind the emerging social conflict between migrants and Chileans. The growing arrival of migrants to Santiago has reinforced racism and the racialization of the urban space through social interactions and practices that take place in residential neighbourhoods. Drawing on a larger research project that consisted in a 17-month ethnography between 2015 and 2018 in one of the most multicultural neighbourhoods of Santiago, this article contributes to unravel racism and the emerging processes of racialization, considering the role that the politics of housing and the housing market play in the intercultural coexistence and the emergent conflict. I argue that the precarious housing conditions in which migrants are forced to live have an impact on the reproduction of racism and the construction of racial hierarchies of belonging that challenge migrants' “right to the city”, especially Afro-descendants, deepening their exclusion."

Furthermore, recent research suggests that children who come from low status families are already less willing to get politically involved. The present paper aims to analyze the possible impact that schools can have in mitigating the effect of parents' socioeconomic status on students' expected electoral participation, focusing on two variables: civic knowledge and classroom climate. The analyses are based on a series of multilevel models using Chilean data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2009. The results support the influence of students' socioeconomic background on expected electoral participation. Furthermore, civic knowledge and classroom climate show a positive and similar influence on students' expected participation. However, classroom climate appears less affected by students' background than civic knowledge, opening the discussion about which strategy should be emphasized when aiming to mitigate the political participation gap."

Using Chilean data from Civic Education Study, 1999 (N = 5688), and International Civic and Citizenship Education Study, 2009 (N = 5192), the present research analyzes, on the one hand, the impact of socioeconomic variables on attitudes toward future political participation and, on the other hand, explores to what extent the association between social origin and participation has changed over time. The analysis is performed in a multilevel framework, to account for both family socioeconomic status and individual school characteristics. The results support the hypothesis that social origin continues to have a strong influence on students’ attitudes toward political participation, in the context of the two measurement points. The resulting discussion focuses on the role of schools in reducing socioeconomic differences, an issue that acquires additional relevance in societies with high inequality such as Chile."

The research was conducted by establishing a collaborative partnership between the professional research team and a high school teacher, according to Greenwood and Levin's ideas. Specifically, twenty-nine students inquired and debated for four weeks about the proposals of the candidates, as well as the socially live issues associated with them. Subsequently, the students' ideas about the experience were explored through questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and a discussion group. Complementarily, classroom observations were conducted, and the participating teacher was interviewed. After that, the information obtained was processed using the qualitative content analysis method. The results point to the effectiveness of the module implemented in the development of citizenship competencies and to the importance students give to the discussion of the social reality in the classroom, in an atmosphere of respect for diverse opinions. In turn, the conclusions identify several strengths and weaknesses to be considered in future applications. Likewise, they highlight the students' active role and the debate on controversial issues in citizenship education and suggest that these elements should be considered in the new Chilean citizenship subject."

The corpus consists of a comment section from the Facebook group Aprender Mapudungun, where there are debates referring to discourses that explicitly demonstrate diverse language ideologies and their links with the extralinguistic within the context of Chile. We pay attention to how these ideologies, from linguistic agents and the general public, are coupled, confronted, or dialogued from the assumption of a conceptual contrast established in the relationship between the Mapuche and the Chilean/Winka, constituting complex and multidimensional visions. In this process, linguistic aspects are crucial, especially by means of the management of onomastics and the Mapudungun language."

Social media have empowered Mapudungun language activists and intellectuals and helped them create digital communities, some with hundreds of thousands of followers, from which they establish and promote language policies, defined by themselves. Among the most relevant language ideologies found in the corpus, there is a representation of Indigenous languages as sacred, or untouchable, often implying an essential connection between Indigenous cultures and the natural or spiritual world. This representation (called ""cosmovisionism""by activists) tends to contradict modernizing language ideologies that circulate in emerging Mapudungun language planning, mainly due to the influence of Basque and Catalan models based on the notion of language normalization, actively promoted in Chile by agents from those domains. Modernizing visions of Mapudungun tend to be linked to a nationalist political project that demands a solid connection between land, people, history, cultural identity, and language. This leads to ideological tensions between the urgency to anonymize and the need to depoliticize the language, both simultaneously considered fundamental to secure Mapudungun's expansion."
2381,1,"TITLE: Mothering on the web: A feminist analysis of posts and interactions on a Chilean Instagram account on motherhood | KEYWORDS: good mothering; intensive motherhood; motherhood discourses; mummy blogs; social networks sites (SNS) | ABSTRACT: Social networking sites (SNS) have become important spaces during the early years of parenting. They allow users to access information, share experiences and provide an opportunity to establish support networks. In this article we present the results of our research on a Chilean motherhood account on Instagram. The research, which takes a feminist approach, used Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to analyze discourses around “good mothering”, and the role of this communication site in this process. We present the results in three sections: a) “Positioning in debates about motherhood”; b) “Real motherhood and maternal love”; and c) “Interactions as regulatory mechanisms”. The main findings suggest that these SNS, through interactions between the account holder and their followers, reproduce dominant discourses of what is considered to be “good mothering” which both sustain asymmetrical gendered power relationships and challenge such power relations. Furthermore, we conclude that although SNS may appear to be an inclusive relational space, the regulatory mechanisms of the sites circumscribe who, and how one, can participate in this space."
2382,18,"TITLE: Assumption of the Myths of Romantic Love: Its Relationship With Sex, Type of Sex-Affective Relationship, and Sexual Orientation | KEYWORDS: better-half; bisexual; consensual non-monogamy; exclusivity; monogamy; polyamory | ABSTRACT: Romantic love promotes and lays the foundation for the development of hegemonic affective sex relationships, guiding the normative ways of feeling and experiencing love. This way of conceiving love is an intrinsic part of women's subordination, and it entails a greater tolerance for situations of violence in sex-affective relationships in which the exercise of asymmetric power relations between men and women is legitimized. With the current advent of the postmodern stage, a wide variety of dissident (non-heterosexual) sexual orientations with heterosexual hegemony have been given greater visibility and legitimacy, and new ways of relating to sex affectively have emerged initially opposed to traditional romantic discourse, the fundamental pillar of monogamy. The aim of the present work was to study whether these different ways of linking us and understanding affective sex relations marked a significant difference with respect to the heterosexual monogamous hegemonic model in the assumption of the mythified ideas of romantic love. Therefore, we studied the relationship between sex, sexual orientation, and the type of sex-affective relationship (monogamous or non-monogamous by consensus) in the assumption of the myths of romantic love. For this purpose, an instrument that showed appropriate psychometric properties was created, and a cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 1,235 people who completed a self-administered online questionnaire. The results indicated that there were no significant differences according to sex, but there were differences in sexual orientation and type of relationship. It may be concluded that a person, regardless of sex, heterosexual or homosexual, monogamous or who has never had affective sex relations, will have a significantly greater probability of assuming the myths of romantic love than a person with a sexual orientation other than heterosexual or homosexual and who is in a non-monogamous consensual relationship."

Responses to the guiding question of what differences and similarities are discernible in the sociocultural adaptation processes that international university students experience in the university versus outside university in the receiving society. It presents a metasynthesis of 12 empirical studies that apply qualitative methodologies to the study of international university students' sociocultural adaptation, which were published in scientific journals indexed in Ebscohost, WOS and Scopus from January 2012 to March 2019. The metasynthesis results indicate that sociocultural adaption involves: (1) situations of shock that arise in the two environments of academic and daily life with specific challenges proper to each one, and (2) the deployment of varying intrapersonal and social resources in each context. Academic and daily life can be considered as necessarily linked to sociocultural adaptation given the compensatory function observed in relational dynamics of students as they move between the two settings. The emphasis of the research on presenting sociocultural adaptation as a primarily negative process, the theoretical implications of separating academic life from daily life, and the relevance of exploring the role of social networks in students' daily life are discussed."

To answer it, I take a dialectical approach to fallacies and consider their dialectical and rhetorical effects. Then, I review the current literature on the proper answer to fallacies to conclude that, under certain circumstances, all the answers provided in the literature can be helpful for the parties. Later, I attempt to provide some heuristic guidance to understand which response to a fallacy is better under which circumstance. To do that, I introduce two criteria for evaluating dialogues: the level of adversariality and the relevance of the epistemic goal. I will conclude that these criteria can help us understand which is the adequate response to fallacies and could also be important for addressing other problems in argumentation theory."

One of the categories that would allow understanding new migration experiences is ""transmigration"": the manner of being in two places at once, made possible by technological, economic and cultural changes. Although migration between Peru and Chile is crucial to comprehend the present relationship between both countries, the viewpoint of transmigration has not yet been developed in extant research. This article seeks to move forward in that direction, also incorporating oral testimonies from the protagonists of these transnational movements. This maneuver allows us to consider new elements of the Peruvian-Chilean migration, and allows a reflection on the concept of transmigration more as the expression of a possible stage than just as a fixed identity, acknowledging the experiences of the actors involved."
2390,3,"TITLE: The Usefulness of Temporary Use: Narratives from Santiago’s Contemporary Urban Practices | KEYWORDS: Incrementality; Santiago; Temporary urbanism; Temporary use; Usefulness | ABSTRACT: Temporary use practices, enacted in spaces of uncertainty, arise from citizens’ self-made actions to reclaim and appropriate spaces for their unmet needs, but also, from urban change driven by public and private institutions. Such practices have an ambiguous character because they are emerging as alternative approaches to the conventional logics of city production using incremental learning and experimentation to demonstrate possible changes, while also being used instrumentally as palliative solutions to urban problems. This research critically explores the extent to which these practices challenge the production of public space by examining the role and usefulness of temporary interventions in the city of Santiago, Chile. The topic, widely explored in the North, has had limited academic explorations in the South, and particularly in the Chilean context where this research focuses. Instead of aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of specific temporary urbanisms from the field, this paper focuses on the narratives of multiple actors that are engaged with the making, imagining, use and regulation of different temporary use practices in Santiago. Using an interpretive approach to qualitative research, through this chapter, I examine the relevance of temporary use by challenging two rooted assumptions regarding the production of public space."

Based on the emergent findings of this research, racialised experien-ces of families in their contact with agencies, policies and child protection ins-titutions in Chile are revealed as well as their place within the Rights paradigm discourse guiding the government’s design. This analysis emerges from a doctoral research. It was a qualitative study that sought to explore the implication of gender in practitioners’ constructions of parenting in child protection services in Chile, in the Servicio Nacional de Me-nores, before its current reform in 2021 to become the new Servicio Mejor Ni-ñez. The data collection was made through a review of 18 case files within three child protection services, data which was later deepened and complemented with 13 interviews with practitioners carrying out those intervention proces-ses. Thus, significant findings were gathered to be discussed in light of a more comprehensive policy framework regarding the State’ contact with mapuche families through policies and services, as well as to interrogate their assigned place. This is to examine sources of contradiction and tensions from inside the dynamics of the frontline work with the intercultural and rights perspective as both enacted in policy frameworks with the focus on child protection and well-being."

With the aim of describing and interpreting preschool teachers’ subjective theories about the development, teaching, and learning of prosocial behavior, we conducted an interpretative and descriptive study using a case study with qualitative methodology. We used a convenience sampling in which episodic interviews and discussion groups were carried out to 16 preschooler teachers from a north city of Chile. Data was analyzed by using techniques of topic coding and grounded theory. From this analysis, essentialist subjective theories of human nature, infancy and prosociality were found, which support (1) preschooler teacher’ subjective theories about how prosociality develops, teaches and learns in young children, in addition to supporting (2) poor pedagogical practices of preschool teachers. Finally, results are discussed in the light of the current literature of prosocial behavior, proposing new areas of topic research and some suggestions to promote education in prosociality."

However, few tools have been developed to collect the experiences of those who face such aggression. Methodology: The objective is to validate an instrument designed to assess the extent of exposure to hate speech. Additionally, it aims to examine the consequential impact on the engagement and involvement of migrant communities within the media landscape of Chile. The Delphi method, incorporating expert judgment and cognitive interviews, is implemented in this study. A meticulously crafted questionnaire comprising 26 items is applied to a pilot sample of 453 migrants residing in Chile, 51% of whom are between 30 and 59 years old, 58% are female and 60% come from Venezuela. Results: A Cronbach's Alpha of 0.95 is reached and it is found that 62% of respondents have received hate messages through Instagram (56%) and Facebook (45%), linked to their nationality (33%) and under the framing of security (43%), experiencing discomfort (53%) and hopelessness (56%). Consequently, 41% ""sometimes"" deleted media accounts from their digital information diet and only 7% ""frequently"" participate in media environments. Discussion: It is warned that cyber hate towards migrant people could produce disinformation, by news avoidance, and affect the media participation of these communities. Conclusions: A validated questionnaire was acquired to gather insights into the exposure of migrants when confronted with hate speech and its possible effects."

Therefore, the integration process also involves an emotional dimension. From a case study, with a biographical focus and an ethnographic perspective, I analyze the emotional management that a pregnant and migrant woman develops in the face of public health policy. The objective is to be able to identify the role of emotions in the trajectory of a pregnant Venezuelan user of the Chile Crece Contigo program. The life story shows how particular events, which I identify as possible obstetric and institutional violence, are attenuated by strategies of regulation and emotional transfer, which sublimate rage, pain, and suffering in a process of general migrant integration."

2400,-1,"TITLE: Sound, Precarity, and Mapuche Reality in Urban Santiago | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This article explores the role of sound during the performance of the Mapuche ceremony llellipun in Santiago. It argues that ceremonial sounds create an immersive experience that facilitates intercommunication between humans, spirits, and the ecosystem amid an eco-spiritually precarious space, thereby making audible a distinctively urban Mapuche way of thinking and being in the world. In establishing and rendering perceptible human, non-human, and more-than-human relations, sound production and sensation reaffirm the often-neglected presence of eco-spiritual forces and entities in the city—central components of the Mapuche lived world. However, this lived entanglement of the anthropological, ecological, and cosmological orders facilitated by llellipun differs from that of rural Mapuche settings. Indeed, Santiago's ecological and urban precarity, which hinders communication with nature and spirits, turns llellipun into an essential means of Mapuche existence, allowing them to reactivate an eco-spiritual relationality that urbanity has certainly obstructed but not yet destroyed."
2401,-1,"TITLE: Ulutun: sound, materiality and power in a Mapuche ritual | KEYWORDS: affect; Mapuche music; materiality; ritual; shamanism; sound | ABSTRACT: In this article I reflect on sonic power in a Mapuche healing ritual guided by a machi (Mapuche ritual specialist): the ulutun. Through her prayers, songs and instrumental performance, the machi revitalises the affected person, their family, and their environment and frightens away ‘the bad’. If the machi and, to a certain extent, Chaw Ngünechen (Mapuche god with attributes of totality) are responsible for the production of sound, their power additionally comes from newen, the immanent force of the world, its beings, and objects. From a Mapuche conception of sound, this does not consist only in vibratory force, but rather also in a manifestation of newen, and the change in its vibratory qualities constitutes the expression of more or less newen. This double comprehension of sound, as both vibration and newen, aligns with ethnomusicological and affect theories and contributes to research focused on other cosmologies."

The aim of this review is to analyze the use of ethnography in the study of Mapuche music, in Chile. We carry out a bibliographic review in various sources of information (thesis repositories, academic databases, dissemination spaces associated with mapuche organizations) and select works that address mapuche musical expressions that use the methodology in question, or some ethnographic “component” in their qualitative approaches. The analyzed corpus includes publications from 1970 to early 2019. In the thirty-two works reviewed, we identified the following methodological aspects: study topics, location of the work, duration of the field work and data collection techniques. Subsequently, we reflect on how they understand and develop ethnography as a methodological framework and as text. Finally, we reflect on the possible factors that affect the modest use of ethnography in the study of Mapuche music, a methodology that, in addition to being rarely used in the investigations of the sound expressions of this society, is, in many cases, partially used."

This study reports since his departure from the capital – including his performances in Talca, Valdivia, Los Angeles, Concepción and Valparaíso, among the main cities he has visited – until his return to Santiago and his performances with the Cuban virtuoso Joseph White Laffita. It is observed that these activities – especially those concerning his flute concerts, were framed in the typical model of a European traveling virtuoso of the 19th century, but in this case a Chilean one and through Chile – which constitute a novel and modernizing experience for a Chilean musician from this time, and unique, in any case, for a wind instrumentalist in the country during that century. In this way, this text aims to recover and give meaning to these contributions as it is an unprecedented musical career and which contemplates elements little addressed in the historical account of music in Chile in the 19th century."

It covers his musical training and contact with the Italian virtuoso Achille Malavasi in 1856, up to his concerts with Louis Moreau Gottschalk in 1866, making a tour of his performances through the press testimonies of Santiago and Valparaíso. Although he was a multifaceted musician, since during his career he also cultivated composition, teaching, band and orchestra conducting, and music publishing and journalism, the modern flute, of the Boehm system, was the element that defined him artistically. The reflection points out that, even though the memory of Ruperto Santa Cruz’s concert activity has vanished, his recovery contributes to a broader understanding of instrumental performance and concert music in Chile during the 19th century."

2408,9,"TITLE: Intermarriage in the Quilombo: Southey’s Republic of Runaway Slaves | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: For Reginald Heber, reviewer of Robert Southey’s History of Brazil in the Quarterly Review, one of the most “striking” parts of Southey’s narrative was that the Portuguese fostered intermarriage in their colonial territories, instead of promoting segregation. Depictions of intermarriage in the text are in fact abundant but remain understudied, even amongst several recent outstanding publications on Southey and imperialism. In this essay, I analyze one of these depictions of intermarriage: the quilombo of Palmares, a “rustic republic” founded by runaway slaves. I argue that Southey uses the quilombo of Palmares, a marginalized multi-ethnic community in the Portuguese imperial territory, to imagine the origin of new nations through intermarriage. I demonstrate that Southey’s Palmares superadds classical republicanism to a discourse of organic nations with distinct customs. I conclude that, for Southey, Palmares illustrates a troubling possibility suggested by the racial constitution of the Brazilian society that pushed Palmarese citizens into marginality: that the dissolution of race categories through intermarriage could be an advantageous and inevitable outcome in imperial societies."

Sexual assault became a repeated and systematic practice throughout the entire time the military base was operational (1984-1998). In 2016, nine women started legal proceedings to demand justice and reparations for the crimes committed against them. The aim of this article is to focus on the construction of the image of the perpetrators of sexual assaults in the military during the armed conflict, paying particular attention to Manta. To achieve this, the opinions of six of the nine rape survivors have been analyzed from conversations taking place over the two years of the field research. Also, this article will analyze how an image of the soldiers as ‘innocent' and ‘decent’ men has been constructed by the defendants. For this, the author analyzes their ethnographic field notes realized during the trial. The analysis of the conduct of both the soldiers and their lawyers during the hearings allows to observe the construction of a story of innocence that attaches to the triumphalist memoria salvadora that exists in Peru."

However, soldiers began raping women on a daily and repeated basis. The purpose of this article is to reflect on how women survivors of sexual violence have come to understand these experiences. In the article, I examine the discourse contained in the testimonies given by women from the communities of Manta and Vilca to the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CVR). I then analyze the in-depth conversations I had with six of the nine women survivors of rape from the Manta community who are plaintiffs in the judicial process underway since 2016 against fourteen military personnel accused of being their aggressors. These conversations are part of my ethnographic work conducted in 2018 and 2019. By way of conclusion, I note that the meanings that women survivors have given to their experiences reflect subjectivities related to the historical context, but above all to the socio-cultural context. In turn, these subjectivities vary over time, resulting in resignifications of the experiences. This paper is also intended to capture women’s voices through the use of the notion of rape survivor, which theoretically and methodologically seeks to highlight the agency and creativity of the women who are subjected to such experiences."

Are police forces inherently authoritarian institutions that cannot be reformed? Our aim is to explore these questions by analysing the case of Spain, a constitutional democracy considered free by liberal standards, yet where, in the short period between 2011 and 2024, the two main policing bodies in Spain—the National Police and the Guardia Civil—were involved in the legal and illegal surveillance and espionage of almost one-hundred parliamentarians from left-wing, Basque, and Catalan organisations, the questionable infiltration of “radical” and “anti-fascist” social movements, and operations to cover up widespread royal, political, and corporate corruption."

On the riots or social unrest that occurred in Chile in the last quarter of 2019 and early 2020, the Public Criminal Defense Office adopted a set of measures to offer legal defense to those who were detained or indicted by the criminal prosecution bodies. This research compares crime behavior in the country between 2017 and 2021 and identifies the social unrest crimes. These are a group of crimes whose frequency increased considerably during the turbulent months: 1) burglary, 2) public disorder, 3) disturbances to public order, and 4) attacks and threats against authorities. The volume and specificities of the social unrest crimes challenged the entire justice sector and, in doing so, made it possible to generate beliefs about the legitimacy of the criminal justice system. In contexts of social unrest, the generation of such beliefs seems especially important, because they can increase perceptions of injustice, enhancing the motivations that give rise to such unrest. Therefore, the operational reactions deployed in the Public Criminal Defense Office to ensure timely criminal defense services are explained. Good practices of the Public Criminal Defense Office that could be strengthened institutionally and normatively so that the justice sector is better prepared to face complex or unusual criminological phenomena, such as those that occurred during the social outburst, are also highlighted."

The present study uses a statistical linear regression model to assess the evolution of penal trends and the impact of the implementation of the RPP for the period 1991-2007 through comprehensive data by region, year, and procedural regime, while controlling for regional demographic growth. Findings reveal a sustained upward trend in the convicted prison population that originates in the 1990s, prior to the RPP. In addition, the reform caused a significant decrease in the prison population subjected to pre-trial custody. There is no evidence to suggest that the reform caused an increase in the convicted prison population during the study period. The effects of the reform on alternatives to imprisonment and parole are disparate. These findings provide sufficient evidence to confirm current hypotheses regarding punitive historical trends in Chile and the rights-based effects of the criminal justice reform."

In a country where over 90 percent of the population lives in segregated cities, where employment opportunities cluster in affluent neighborhoods, residential sorting has surprisingly been neglected as an explanatory factor. This article addresses this omission by calculating the effects of residential segregation on labor market participation among less-educated caregivers. Using an OLS fixed effects model, the study finds that segregation entails adverse spatial mismatch effects on labor market participation. No other sub-population is affected in this manner. Hence, residential segregation contributes to the consolidation of three types of inequalities. First, it reproduces gendered inequalities within less-educated households. Second, in the context of increasing labor market participation among more-educated women, residential segregation further increases inequalities between low-income and affluent households. Finally, it deepens geographical inequalities between marginalized and non-marginalized households. HIGHLIGHTS Residential segregation has excluded less-educated caregiving women from paid work. Less-educated communities reside in regions with low job density. A spatial mismatch is a gendered phenomenon insofar as mobility is gendered. Segregation does not affect men’s or more-educated women’s labor force participation. Segregation aggravates economic, geographic, and gender inequalities."

By questioning the possibility of reaching a balanced and sustainable state of functioning for social-ecological systems, resilience improves the static framework of sustainability by acknowledging non-linear behavior of complex systems, inevitability of change, and consistent presence of uncertainty. At the core of sustainable development, environmental policy is embedded in the socio-spatial structures that constantly re-organize and breed uncertainty, such as political, economic, and climate uncertainty. These uncertainties create episodes of instability that shock the entire system including the structures of environmental protection. In this article, focusing on the aftermath of 2016 US presidential election and 2018 general election in Brazil, both broadly recognized as political shocks, we highlight the vulnerabilities of environmental protection structures to the rise of conservative populist movements. We attribute these vulnerabilities, partially, to the superiority of market-based instruments, as well as apolitical understandings of resilience under neoliberalism that overlook political instabilities and socio-spatial outcomes of neoliberal restructuring projects. In our assessment, political unpreparedness of sustainability against the right-wing onslaught in the US and Brazil further underlines the need for resilience theory to incorporate sources of political instability in order to protect the environment."

Student social relationships based on friendship, perceived ability, and collaboration are characterized through a social network analysis. The methodology is quantitative and employs a one-group design. The sample consists of 196 students (142 males and 54 females) from different course sections. Strong and weak collaboration variables are defined based on whether or not interactions occur among friends. The results show a more intense collaboration in laboratory sessions than in theoretical lectures. Additionally, these variables show a low but positive Spearman correlation with grades, with the highest correlation observed between theory and laboratory grades. In conclusion, classroom collaboration enhances academic success that when encouraged can open new opportunities for teaching physics on virtual environments."

This research focuses on a school intervention aimed at enhancing collaboration and friendship among high school students during a school year. A semester-long intervention included two classrooms where students were grouped based on existing affinities, and two classrooms with teams randomly assigned by the teacher. Friendship, collaboration, and peer nomination networks for academic reputation were measured throughout the academic year. We employed the Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure (MRQAP) to analyze changes within the social networks in each classroom independently. Findings demonstrate the gravity of friendship ties for collaboration, with affinity-based teams engaging mostly in an ‘inward’ collaborative approach relying on inside-group friends. Conversely, working relations in the experimental classroom showcase an ‘outward’ strategy by leveraging friends across different groups. The collaborative activities addressed during the semester led to the formation of new friendships and significantly influenced the evolution of social networks across consecutive semesters. This analysis underscores the classroom as a dynamic social ecosystem and highlights how deliberate strategies for group formation can foster meaningful social and developmental advancements to improve individuals’ social inclusion and its potential for learning and development."

Yet, the factors influencing group formation, social cohesion, and group stability have remained understudied in physics education. Here, we examine these factors in a cohort of 90 students from ninth and tenth grades at a private school in Chile. For a semester-long physics project, students were assigned to groups either through random allocation (control group) or given the autonomy to form their own groups (experimental group). Our findings indicate that the groups formed by choice developed stronger friendship bonds throughout the semester, while the groups formed randomly demonstrated greater levels of cooperation and more frequent changes in membership, suggesting weaker social cohesion. Additionally, tenth-grade students were more likely to stay in their original groups, possibly indicating increased social maturity. These findings emphasize the ongoing challenge in education of balancing student choice in group formation with the need for diverse group compositions that enhance learning. This study provides practical recommendations for physics teachers and researchers."

The intervention includes the reading of popular science books and group-level activities for solving a sequence of physics questions, conducted over an academic semester (2022) in a sample of 9th and 10th grade students from a secondary school in Chile. The study features a pre-experimental design with pre and post-tests to measure reading comprehension, learning strategies, student working networks during the intervention, and academic performance. Statistical comparisons show significant changes in reading comprehension, and improvements in learning strategies consistent with a transition towards strategic and meaningful learning orientations. Analysis of the collaboration networks allows us to understand these changes from a relational perspective, characterising subgroups and their development. These findings highlight the importance of reading exercises and group-level activities for human development, while social interactions offer alternative insights to understand the classroom experience."

A didactic approach is applied to teaching competency-based general physics in engineering within a modular structure. A mixed methodology is employed, with qualitative methods for the case study interpreting professors’ discourse regarding classroom pedagogical design and practice, and quantitative methods examining teaching practice and its impact on academic performance. As a result, three main categories are identified: 1) didactic strategies, 2) technological resources, 3) and learning monitoring. It is observed that the teaching model influences student dropout rates and academic success. In conclusion, there is a preference for traditional strategies over constructivist strategies, regardless of the professor’s experience level."

Yet, the rise of online and hybrid settings poses new challenges to socialization. Here, we study the social interactions among 191 high school physics students in Chile, comparing online and hybrid classrooms that were assigned in the COVID-19 pandemic context. We found that students in hybrid settings were more connected and more likely to form casual relationships outside their immediate friend groups, which allowed them to gather new information from diverse sources. Along the same lines, in online classrooms, students who excelled in physics occupied more central positions in social networks. This trend was not evident in hybrid settings, suggesting that when social cues are limited, academic performance gains greater importance in establishing social hierarchies and potentially limiting access to diverse information. Our study highlights the importance of social interactions in educational contexts and raises questions about the impact of relational inaccessibility on virtual learning."
2424,0,"TITLE: Long-term collaboration with strong friendship ties improves academic performance in remote and hybrid teaching modalities in high school physics | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Collaboration among students is fundamental for knowledge building and competency development. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of student collaboration depends on the extent that these interactions take place under conditions that favor commitment, trust, and decision making among those who interact. The worldwide pandemic due to COVID-19 and the transition to emergency remote teaching have added new challenges for collaboration, mainly because now students' interactions are wholly mediated by information and communication technologies. This study first explores the effectiveness of different collaborative relationships over performance in physics from a sample of secondary students from two schools located in rural and urban areas in southern Chile (exploratory study). We used social network analysis to map academic hierarchies as in the nominations for proficient peers in physics (i.e., physics prestige), collaboration, and friendship ties. We define a strong association if two students who collaborate shared a friendship tie. Using ordinary least squares multiple linear regression models on physics grades, we found positive effects of collaboration over grades, particularly among students working with friends (strong ties). To test whether the effects of collaboration found in the first study were stable throughout two semesters, the following year we designed a quasiexperiment in four classes from the same urban school in the exploratory study. Here, students attended hybrid school sessions where research participants were either in the classroom or participated remotely. The teacher collected the same social networks described in the first study at the end of semester 1, and two times during semester 2. In addition, we followed the same procedures to identify strong and weak collaboration from the network data on each wave of data collection. After fitting ordinary least squares multiple linear regression models, we found that collaborative variables negatively associated with grades on activity 1 (semester 1), yet at the end of the year (activity 3 in semester 2) having strong working ties became positively associated with physics grades. Interestingly, the relationship of academic hierarchies measured in physics prestige with grades transitions from positive on semester 1 to null by the end of the year. These results contribute to the literature of collaboration in physics education and its effectiveness, by taking into account social relationships and the needed time for developing beneficial collective processes among students in the classroom. We discuss these results and their implications for instructional design and guidelines for constructive group-level processes."
2425,0,"TITLE: Classroom creativity and students’ social networks: Theoretical and practical implications | KEYWORDS: Classroom activities; Collaboration; Creativity; Education; Social networks | ABSTRACT: Social Network Analysis (SNA) is becoming a popular theoretical and methodological approximation for educational researchers. SNA enables a deep exploration of learning and development as a by-product of social interactions. Research findings from social networks for creativity has found specific social structures that ease knowledge transfer and the emergence of creative ideas in a variety of contexts. This work links the research findings in social networks and creativity with education and classroom activities, to provide a framework from which to understand social interactions in the classroom and to inform educational improvement. By conceptualizing learning and problem solving as the creative outcome of both cognitive and social processes, this paper describes how different forms of collaboration and social structures might emerge based on teaching and learning practices enacted in the classroom through the lens of social network analysis. In addition, attention to the classroom network should inform teachers on areas for pedagogical innovation. Subsequently, I propose guidelines on how to advance pedagogical decision-making for learning and creativity based upon students’ social networks. This work is designed to facilitate theoretical and practical insights for educators and researchers to make evidence-based decisions in the pursuit of creativity in the classroom."

However, due to their constrained nature, these problems hinder collaboration and idea generation. In order to encourage student collaboration and decision making demands among undergraduate students in an introductory physics course, we utilized a real-world problem where groups were asked to compose a well-structured physics problem for younger learners. In this study we explored how they collaborated in composing physics problems. Data collection consisted of audio recording of the group discussions while they were collaborating to develop their physics problems and their respective problem solutions. Through interviews, we accessed participants' perceptions of the task and related challenges. Results suggest that composing problems is an opportunity for participants to propose ideas and make decisions regarding the goals of the problem, concepts and procedures, contextual details, and magnitudes and units to introduce in their activities. Further, participants valued the open-ended nature of the task and recognized its benefits in utilizing physics ideas into context, which in turn enabled collaboration in a way not experienced by them with traditional well-structured problems. These findings shed light on the nature of composing physics problems in undergraduate courses, where participants assume a different role by facing a real-world activity that encourages expertise through physics-related communication and writing."

Yet we lack a complete understanding of how different instructional strategies impact the relationship between cooperation and learning. In this paper we present results from a field experiment with 82 first-year students in an introductory physics course showing how different instructional strategies led to different social configurations in the classroom and to differences in individual academic performance. Surprisingly, we found that students who actively sought out information from multiple peers were less likely to perform well on well-structured problems as compared to those who did not seek help, whereas, for ill-structured (real-world-like) problems, this effect depended on the features of the learning environment. We observed that good performance on ill- and well-structured problems was sensitive to different social network configurations. In a highly clustered network (which contains redundant information), students performed better on well-structured problems than ill-structured problems. By contrast, students with access to network structural holes (which enable access to more diverse information) performed ill-structured problems better than well-structured problems. Finally, ill-structured problems promoted creative thinking, provided that instructors guided the problem-solving process and motivated students to engage in the appropriate cognitive demands these problems entailed. Our results suggest that teaching and instructional strategies play an important role in cooperative learning; therefore, educators implementing cooperative learning methods have to accompany them with adequate instructional strategy."

This study looks at three undergraduate physics sections at a university in Chile and how students generated and established their own problems in circular motion (CM) for high school students. By collecting and analyzing the work created by undergraduate student groups, we were able to identify the various physics concepts and characteristics students used when developing the situation of each problem, the content involved, and the question items designed for high school students. Through a description of the concepts and characteristics, we identify differences and similarities regarding kinematic concepts and problem characteristics across the three sections that undergo different sets of physics problems. This work may further our understanding of how students interpret and use the physics ideas taught at the undergraduate level, and the types of problems they are most familiar with depending on instruction."

Estudio de casos en educación secundaria en Chile | KEYWORDS: Didactic geography; Geographic consciousness; Geographic thinking; Teachers | ABSTRACT: Currently, teaching Geography implies classroom experiences that challenge students to make important decisions. Geographic consciousness plays a pivotal role to children and youngsters to comprehend the spatial changes of society, and also, to act against spatial and environmental problems relevant to their realities. The latter said by the possibilities that are granted by a geographical perspective. The aim of this case-study is to analyze whether teachers take into account the critical geographical consciousness formation when teaching. Also, the main themes, which are used to interpret the practice of teaching, are shown. The mixed method is used in this research; however, it is worth mentioning that there is a predominance of the qualitative method. In order to gather information, interviews and classroom observation from five Chilean teachers from History and social science were carried out. Results show that teachers are forming students focusing on geographical consciousness. This focus is based upon a descriptive-analytic position given that it maintains a memory-teaching tradition, which variates from local and global scales. As well, this position considers the temporality of a specific moment, or another moment from past to present, and finally, it also considers the importance of the territories (in dispute, strategical points, specific places) whereas men and women are not addressed."

In particular, the concept of homothety is impacted by teaching methodologies that emphasize rote memorization and procedural repetition rather than conceptual understanding. This study explores how a task sequence fosters mathematical work with the concept of homothety among 15- to 16-year-old students in a public high school in the Maule Region of Chile. Grounded in the mathematical working space (MWS) theory, this research provides a framework for analyzing how students engage with mathematical tasks. Employing a qualitative approach, specifically a case study, the findings reveal that the task sequence contributes to progressive mathematical reasoning. The study concludes that the designed activities align with the criteria for “emblematic tasks”, evidencing their fundamental role in supporting students’ conceptual understanding of homothety."

Both theories, first separately and then in relation to one another, are used to analyse two tasks proposed by the teacher in the classroom following a cross-methodology for networking of theories. Through a single case study research design, a content analysis of the transcript of the video recording of the lesson was conducted. The joint analysis of this lesson allows us to better understand the mathematical work taking place in the classroom. In particular, the results show the scope of each model and their complementarity through the detection of meeting points and blind spots, through the role of proof, representations, and the change between geometrical and numerical work in teaching Thales’s theorem. This allows for a deeper understanding of a teacher’s practice and teaching. Ultimately, relationships between the theoretical elements of both theories are established to show their complementarity. We conclude that networking between theories can contribute to the development of these theories by raising questions that involve examining their foundations and assumptions in greater depth."

In this context, we have formulated the research objective of characterizing the mathematical work that teachers favor based on the examples that they implement in the teaching of topics within the domain of secondary school algebra. To this end, this study is situated within the interpretive paradigm utilizing an instrumental collective case study approach. The study design entails the selection of two representative cases of mathematics teachers in Chilean schools, with the objective of understanding and describing their mathematical work in the secondary school classroom based on the examples they present. The results show that the first teacher utilizes varied examples that activate distinct forms of mathematical thinking, promoting the activation of both instrumental and discursive genesis. In contrast, the second teacher follows a more traditional approach, with the use of examples to illustrate and motivate, and a direct presentation of knowledge, activating primarily semiotic genesis, in which a transition between the numerical and the algebraic is lacking. Ultimately, the results highlight the importance of deeper consideration of the choice of examples in the teaching of algebra and how these examples can influence students’ learning. Furthermore, additional ideas are put forward for future work in this line of research associated with the use of examples in the classroom."

Using a qualitative case study approach, four classroom episodes focused on fractions, percentages, and algebraic language are analyzed. The study involves one prospective teacher and 23 students from a multi-grade school in central-southern Chile. The analysis integrates teacher's specialized knowledge and mathematical working spaces to explore how these frameworks inform the teacher's knowledge. The findings reveal that the teacher employs personal theories, real-life examples, and graphical aids to enhance students’ understanding, though there is a reliance on rules and algorithms. While specialized knowledge aids in teaching, there is less emphasis on fostering students’ conceptual understanding and judgement. The study recommends improving teacher training programs to better equip prospective teachers in grasping number sense components, highlighting the need for more focused training on its development."

Given the articulations identified in the literature, it is interesting to determine whether new networks with the MWS provide powerful strategies for analysing mathematical modelling task resolution. Objective: to characterise the modelling activity from the network composed by the Blomhøj modelling cycle and the MWS in engineering students. Design: This work is a case study with a qualitative approach, which analyses the resolution of a modelling task through the proposed network. Setting and participants: The experimentation was carried out in an integral calculus course for a computer civil engineering career at a Chilean university. Modelling practices are not usual in this second-year subject, although enhancing their use in professional education is necessary. Data collection and analysis: We collected the written records of the students, selecting one to perform the in-depth analysis due to its high representativeness and clarity, as evidenced in the documents. Three steps were followed to characterise the modelling activity in the written record: description, analysis, and interpretation. Results: The Blomhøj modelling cycle might present connections with the MWS at the formulation of the problem and not only at the systematisation, which is a novelty in this field of research. Conclusions: A novel approach with which to develop the network between the MWS and modelling emerges, emphasising the investigation of mathematical problems using the student’s reality in higher education."

Una reorientación fenomenológica | KEYWORDS: classroom; observation; phenomenology; teacher education; teaching practice | ABSTRACT: Classroom observation is a fundamental practice in teacher education and teacher professional development that allows for systematic processes of evaluation, feedback, and individual and collective reflection on the pedagogical praxis to take place. Although digital technologies have greatly expanded the possibilities of this practice beyond the classroom, for example, using platforms and classroom videos, its theoretical assumptions have, at its core, undergone rather minor modifications. This article questions classroom observation in its conventional and standardized form, using its development in educational research in Chile as an example. The theoretical foundations of a phenomenologically oriented qualitative empirical approach to classroom observation are presented. It also discusses the experience of its operationalization in a workshop on video classroom observation, in which students and graduates of a pedagogical program in Chile participated. Through the continuous repetition of four methodical steps (description, reduction, intersubjective validation, variation), the phenomenological approach is able to: 1) rethink the conventional classroom observation, which is limited to the application of criteria, guidelines, protocols or rubrics given beforehand; 2) allow a critical reflection on previous experiences and biases of the observer; 3) open the observation experience to the contingency and specificity of tacit events or events that have been overlooked in the observed pedagogical situations. Thus, this approach trains the pedagogical gaze inside and outside the classroom and is feasible to implement in initial teacher education."

Starting on a paradoxical vision of childhood and adolescence, which understands CA as vulnerable and dependent and, at the same time, as autonomous and free subjects, we question two common assumptions involved in the processes of research and ethical evaluation of research: On the one hand, the assumption that more participation means overexposure and harm to CA; and, on the other hand, the assumption that more participation is in itself better, and both ethically and pedagogically desirable for research and for CA. Furthermore, we distinguish three basic modes of participation: while research about CA considers them only as ‘topic’, ‘content’ or ‘object’ of study (1), research with CA allows their direct participation in some of the stages of the research (2), and research carried out by CA opens up to the possibility of their full and active participation in one or more stages as co-researchers (3). Thus, we propose that participation is a multidimensional, relational, and ambivalent phenomenon that challenges both traditional adult-centered and child-centered dogmatic positions and demands approaches to ethics that go beyond standardization."

In light of a central and recurring challenge (protection versus participation) and its implications, we reflect on informed consent as an instrument that embodies the power of ethics committees within the research process. We inform this reflection with extracts of visual ethnographic fieldwork carried out in 2017 in a marginalised school in Santiago, Chile, with children aged from 8 to 13. We draw on the principles of the Belmont Report (respect, beneficence, justice) to contrast procedural with situated ethics."

UN ENSAYO CRÍTICO Y FENOMENOLÓGICO | KEYWORDS: digitalization; education; phenomenology; student; technology | ABSTRACT: From a critical and phenomenological perspective, in this essay we aim to question the assumption that the digitalization of study would be an inevitable and necessary advance in educational terms. We argue that digitalization is not a 'solution' for what we have heuristically called study loss, one of the educational losses caused, among other things, by the global suspension of face-to-face educational activities during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our thesis is that digital study has a regressive character as it reduces this practice to only one of its specific moments, which can be described as eminently cognitive and solitary. This hinders, if not prevents, the deployment of study in its complexity and multidimensionality both as a form of life and primarily corporal, social and aesthetic practice. Far from being an educational innovation, digital study rather reinforces a traditional and dominant notion of study in Western cultures that needs to be problematized. We develop our thesis in five instances. First, we address the loss of study at the level of educational discourse that focuses exclusively on teaching and learning. Then, we outline a critique of the traditional Western notion of study as a cognitive, solitary and elitist practice. Subsequently, we characterize three primordial dimensions of study from a phenomenological perspective: corporeality, sociality and aestheticity. In addition, we offer some examples of this characterization in higher education. Finally, we mention four aspects in which the loss of study appears under the conditions of digitalization. We conclude with some considerations in relation to the digital transformation of the educational field."

However, the physical presence of the subjects and the body remain something primordial and irreplaceable in traditional educational processes. Thus, it is often assumed that virtuality is opposed to the corporeal reality of the subjects involved in teaching, learning and studying. In this paper we aim to critically challenge this assumption by addressing the phenomenon of virtuality in a more original sense: as a fundamental dimension of corporeality itself. Drawing on Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological insights, we argue that the experience of the virtual is inherently embodied and fully real. We understand corporeality and virtuality as entangled and multidimensional phenomena. At the same time, this leads us to rethink the digital as only one possible medium in which virtuality can appear as inherent to embodied experience. We develop our phenomenological approach in three instances. First, we question and bracket two common assumptions about corporeality. From our critical perspective, assumptions about a disembodied digitality and a devirtualized corporeality represent extremes within which educational discourses currently move. Second, we address the inherent virtuality of embodied experience. We outline the heuristic concept of the virtual body (Merleau-Ponty) to describe corporeality and virtuality as entangled and multidimensional phenomena that encompass extension, intercorporeality and intermediality. Finally, we make some remarks on the relationships of corporeality and virtuality considering the challenges of digital education."

Reflexões a partir do arquivo oral e da memória do cuartel borgoño (1977-1989), santiago do chile Cuidados en los equipos profesionales: Reflexiones a partir del archivo oral y memoriadel cuartel borgoño (1977-1989), santiago de chile* | KEYWORDS: Care; Case study; Memory; Oral archive; Work-related illness | ABSTRACT: The purpose of this article is to present some of the considerations that arose following the development of an experience of caregiving for teams of professionals who support, investigate, and collect testimonies on human rights violations and the processing of Chile’s dictatorial past. The care experience was based on the psychodrama method, applied in workshop format, over three sessions of approximately two hours each, throughout the months when the interviews of the oral archive project “Resistir Recordando” (2019) were being designed and implemented. This process lasted a year. The project had an archaeological-anthropological approach, developed under the auspices of the Borgoño Memory Corporation, a collective dedicated to building a memorial site for the former secret detention, torture, and extermination center Cuartel Borgoño (1977-1989), located in Santiago, Chile. A qualitative analysis of the instruments used in the care workshop, especially letter writing, observation, and personal notes, is presented to explain the approaches, focus decisions, scopes, and projections. From a perspective that gathers the principles of Dussel’s ethics and multisite ethnography, and that understands the social actors as collaborators, the text discusses the notion of otherness implied in memory work. We conclude that, in general, memory work and research on human rights violations, focused on the testimonial-victim voice, deploy self-care actions that pathologize and individualize the problem. This article proposes that we should consider the figure of professionals and the field of memory as a working space susceptible of being cared for. This opens a new field of discussion on the practice of caring for professional teams, which implies considering other places of enunciation and listening, from the recognition of the density that acquires the treatment of “our catastrophe,” the otherness involved in memory work, and the unresolved nature of the violence it entails."

This paper aims to provide a re-reading of the solvency assessment policy, beyond the paradigm of the average consumer. The argumentative development allows concluding that the finding of the existence of a disparity of types of consumers and the consideration of over-indebtedness as a situation of hypervulnerability obliges the designer of the prevention policy to consider a high degree of protection of the consumer´s interests before the risk of economic-financial crisis, and to a solvency evaluation with a holistic perspective and with a differential approach to appreciate the risk of economic-financial crisis and the effects it generates, paying attention to the set of particular and contextual circumstances of the person."

For this purpose, part 1. dogmatically delimits the institution of the period of good conduct, contrasting its restrictive characteristics of the debtor's interest with those of a rehabilitation period, which takes into consideration the debtor's interest of relief. Part 2. describes the institution introduced by the reform and analyzes the grounds for its establishment. Part 3. critically analyzes the institution and its effects, identifying some problems that have a negative impact on the debtor's interest in relief. This makes it possible to clarify its legal nature as a period of good conduct. In Part 4, interpretative and lege ferenda proposals are put forward for the implementation of a debtor rehabilitation period, which balances the interest of creditor satisfaction and the interest of debtor relief."

Through a review of the multifaceted concept of cantora, or female singer of the people, as well as the analysis of four cueca songs, this study offers insights on how Parra negotiated the terms of the Chilean urban folkloric scene of her time. Her trajectory as a folklorist allowed her to vindicate an otherwise disparaged popular culture, and as cantautora, or singer-songwriter, she redefined the gender roles of her time becoming a musical and political referent for her peers, thus offering renovated perspectives on both female musicianship and national identity."

Our goal is to incite fraught hemispheric conversations about the internalisation of coloniality by subaltern peoples, anticolonial struggles, and the relevance of internal colonial structures of dispossession in the making of Latin American nation-states. We believe in the power of establishing dialogue/cooperation between grassroots Black, Indigenous, and racialised thought against colonialism in Abya Yala and Turtle Island. A reading of these contributions suggests that binary classifications—oppressor/victim, dominator/dominated—trap our imagination, destabilising commitments to decolonisation. We focus on the construction of the environmental state in Chile, conservation discourse in the Riviera Maya, the rise of corporatist rule in southern Mexico City, and cuerpo-territorio mapping in the Ecuadorian Amazonia. We propose that a relational reading of colonial power dynamics enables opportunities for liberation."

It presents a general timeline of historical sources of demographic information while critically interrogating them by exploring Latin American cases. The chapter looks at Big Data's entrance into – and transformation of – demographic methods and urban policy interventions. Population studies and other demographic methods became fundamental tools in the twentieth century for conducting public policy design. Surveys are critical tools to evaluate demographic trends obtained from censuses and develop projections that complete time periods without exhaustive data. Space sampling surveys and large data bases of statistical systems have resulted from the development of methodologies to fill the gaps in administrative records. Sociologist, Sarah Brayne, claims that surveillance and Big Data have shown similar rising patterns during the last decade."

We present the analysis of multiple lines of data associated to the so-called “Archaic-Formative transition” recovering from excavations carried out in the early 2010s. La Capilla 1’s material culture-which represents different social dimensions of these coastal communities related to food, technology and mortuary practices, are employed to interrogate the different activities that were carried out in the site. Furthermore, identifying the areas of procurement of diverse ranges of resources enables us to indicate the networks of mobility and social interactions. In summary, by considering a new set of data and chronology, we broaden the set of activities previously identified on the site emphasizing the relevance of coastal and littoral environments had to the local coastal communities during the transition to the Formative Period in terms of their mobility and/or interaction networks with other populations settled in interior environments of the region."

Recent examinations of plant macro remains and plant fiber artifacts from La Yerba II (7570–6674 cal BP) and La Yerba III (6485–5893 cal BP) sites provide insight into how plant fabric technologies and pre-loom textile traditions unfolded over the Middle Preceramic (or Middle Archaic; 8000–5000 BP) on the south coast of Peru. Using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we conduct comparative analyses of modern and archaeological plants to assess the taxonomy and morphological distinctions between them to discriminate species. We identify materials from wild-gathered plants in the Cyperaceae, Typhaceae, and Apocynaceae families and show how they were used to make fishing nets, looped bags, mats, and other artifacts. Evidence from tools and cut marks also enabled us to reconstruct parts of the chaîne opératoire of the fiber production. We discuss the significance of plants from wetland and estuarine habitats in the interrelated dimensions of fabric manufacture and food consumption among these coastal hunter-gatherers."

The research is based on 45,000 on-line responses to 1,880 reception tests by 470 Spanish and Latin American recipients. Each of the receivers evaluated 25 values, after being exposed to a sample of five ads broadcast on TV during the period studied. The methodology is based on four research objectives and is supported by a new scientific measurement instrument: Proto-coloEva®. Its conclusions reveal a very similar communication strategy in the four sources studied. The values cooperation, well-being, effort, family, health, respect and responsibility were strongly conveyed, and are strongly homogeneous in all the ads studied. In contrast, the values rights, justice-equity, dignity and freedom were perceived with a much lower intensity, and heterogeneously. There was a higher transmission of values among religious people and Latin American people, and a very weak reception of values in people who have suffered COVID-19 directly or closely."

Within this framework, procedural knowledge that unfolds during the reading comprehension process is comprised of cognitive factors that determine the ability to learn from texts, and therefore may constitute predictors of academic achievement. The paper presents the results of a study of first-grade high school students in Catalonia (Spain) (n=196), which explores simple mediational models in search of the indirect effect that basic and intermediate skills have in predicting changes in students’ results, through reading comprehension. Our findings show that part of the total effect is based on skills underlying reading fluency, occasionally on lexical skills displayed during word identification, and never in the domain of the alphabetic principle. These results are discussed with reference to studies that have related reading and academic performance variables, and specifically contrasted with previous studies that do not report the presence of an indirect effect. Our findings pave the way for scientific testing on the empirical effect of teaching strategies that focus on lexical reinforcement and increasing fluency in the quality of understanding, and consequently, on academic results as well as representative values of school learning."

A study of educational practices for the promotion of reading” (PR2018057), reports the results of an exploratory-observational scope research extracted from that context. The main objective is to evidence research hypotheses on the training needs of reading teachers. It investigates some areas of the reading habits of Chilean, Polish and Portuguese adolescents who are in transition between primary and secondary school. There are common and divergent patterns in the answers to a questionnaire that delves into motivational and teaching aspects linked to reading education: leisure reading habits, the provenance of the books students read and the use of libraries, the hierarchization of the importance of reading, the strategies of teachers who train reading skills and also the initiatives to promote reading in schools, and their participation. In the light of results obtained, paths of educational and didactic research are proposed that allow to add value to the role of teachers as mediators of reading in the three national contexts that are part of the analysis."

The article identifies and describes how the discourses on migrant children are produced in a school context, and the sources and references used by teachers. Utilising a focused ethnographic method and based on a critical realist and Bourdieusian approach, this article argues that there are surrounding discourses and pre-existing sets of social relations (state–school relations, socio-spatial relations, intergenerational relations), which are reflexively integrated into the habitus of teachers and the institutional habitus of the school, in order to understand the conviviality with migrant children and to produce social differences."
2469,0,"TITLE: Towards a definition of “mathematical digital competency for teaching” | KEYWORDS: Digital competencies; Documentational approach; Instrumental orchestration; Mathematical competencies; Mathematical digital competency; Mathematics teachers | ABSTRACT: When students engage with a digital tool to tackle a mathematical task, the interplay between their digital competencies and mathematical abilities gives rise to what is termed mathematical digital competency (MDC). Recognising the significance of MDC as an integral component for contemporary students, the relevance of cultivating mathematical digital competency for teaching (MDCT) becomes apparent. We posit that for teachers to effectively guide students in the development of their MDC, possessing MDCT is imperative. In this paper, drawing upon the theoretical frameworks of instrumental orchestration, the documentational approach to didactics, and the Danish competencies framework’s six didactico-pedagogical competencies of mathematics teachers, we propose a theoretical conceptualization of teachers’ mathematical and digital competencies in the context of teaching mathematics with technology. Expanding upon the preliminary definition of students’ MDC, we incorporate pedagogic, theoretical elements tailored to teachers, encapsulating it as MDCT. To expound on the various facets of MDCT, we provide an illustrative example featuring a mathematics teacher proficient in the utilisation of digital technologies and programming."

We provide an overview of CT’s claimed potentials for mathematics teaching and learning and outline the most widely used definitions of CT in mathematics education research. Based on three illustrative cases from Denmark, Sweden, and England, we develop three typologies of ways in which CT and mathematics are related to each other in curricular resources. We also describe the opportunities and challenges these typologies are associated with for teachers in relation to connecting CT and mathematics in the mathematics education classrooms. We conclude the paper by discussing the relation between tendencies in how CT is enacted in mathematics curriculum policy and how it is studied in the mathematics education research community. Moreover, we reflect on the implications of this relation for the opportunities of informing CT in mathematics education through state-of-the-art research."

Within the rules that regulate the process, it is established that the text of the new Constitution must respect the international treaties ratified by Chile. Some authors have pointed out that this rule entails a substantive limit to the process underway. This paper argues that the rule has another constitutional function: to ensure the exclusive dedication of the Constitutional Convention. It does not follow, however, that international treaties - especially human rights treaties - will not serve as a standard or guideline for the process. Such soft approach, which is a way to respect international law, is fully consistent with a democratic version of the constituent power."

These metrics aggregate the headway variability for a service, but none can be directly associated with a specific driver. This paper seeks to understand drivers' influence on a service's regularity. To do so, we propose four regularity indices related to a driver's performance and use the Hierarchical Clustering Analysis method to generate a classification of drivers according to their contribution to the headway regularity during the operation of a service. We characterize each class based on the driver's attributes such as age, years of experience as a driver, and years in the bus company, and those attributes associated with the operation, such as number of services per day and period of the day. The results show consistency in the classification obtained, with nearly 90% of drivers remaining in the same regularity classes regardless of the index."

This work aims to understand how drivers approach the tools that seek to control the regularity of the headways. Our study is conducted on the Transantiago, the public transport system of Santiago in Chile. Buses operating two routes of this service provider have been equipped with a headway control tool that provides drivers instructions to improve headway regularity. Our results show experienced drivers (over 50 years) perceive being faster and maintaining more regular headways than younger ones. They also appear to be more reluctant to use onboard headway control tools. Less experienced drivers recognize the accuracy of the information delivered and assure that it has improved their driving performance."

Based on two criteria, geographical and typological, three initiatives are analyzed: El Morro Remodeling, Iquique; Ignacio Zenteno Housing Complex in Cerro Lecheros, Valparaíso; and Villa San Pedro township, in Coronel. These cases allow us to examine the housing proposal in its relation with the city through the Housing Corporation (CORVI). The sources used —mainly institutional memories, periodical publications, and records of the initiatives studied— are put into perspective under a methodology that compares the three selected cases that are characterized by different geographical situations and project strategies: remodeling, complex, and township. While the remodeling of Iquique sought to generate contrast through the horizontality of the block, in the Valparaíso complex, on the other hand, the block breaks to adapt to the slope; and in the town of Coronel, a garden city with a wide diversity of uses was planned on the outskirts of the city. This reflects different ways in which the city was planned, adapting to different urban and landscape contexts, but under the same logic of housing provision in a period in which the city was the subject of social, urban, and political debate."

Renovación urbana e integración entre las prácticas de la planificación y la conservación del patrimonio urbano | KEYWORDS: heritage; urban centers; urban renewal | ABSTRACT: The objective of this article is to contribute to the debate on urban renewal in Latin American historic centers, specifically analyzing how certain regulations have mor-phologically transformed colonial built heritage in Santiago de Chile. The article critically examines urban renovations and regulatory changes developed in the Casa Colorada block. Few colonial buildings remain in the historic center; earthquakes have destroyed a large portion, and the deregulation of urban renovations and certain norms have had a negative impact on their conservation. Therefore, we analyze the normative transformations from the Official Urbanization Plan of the Commune of Santiago (1939) until the application of the Conjunto Armónico (Specific Plan Area) and the definition of the Historic Conservation Zone (2008). The block where the Historic Monument is located is a paradigmatic example, since it reveals the different morphological regulations that have been applied and the scarce colonial heritage that remains."

The processes of modifi-cation of the Communal Regulatory Plans (PRC) of the communes of the O’Higgins, Maule and Bío-Bío regions were analyzed. In many of the affected communes, well-founded risk studies were generated as inputs for their regulatory plans. The process revealed that there were communes and towns that did not even have an urban boundary, and cases of PRC that had not been updated, which made them vulnerable to new events. This, coupled with the fact that PRCs only cover urban areas and that most of the rural sectors that were affected did not have planning instruments and risk zoning. Despite the large number of studies for amending regulatory plans and areas at risk, very few plans were successfully approved. The analysis shows that there is an urgent need to advance in the improvement of territorial planning instruments in terms of the updating of the risk studies in post-disaster processes."

This essay demonstrates that a significant sector of the historiography on colonial and modern Latin America challenges, or at least qualifies, Pateman's thesis and concludes, therefore, that it is a weak thesis in historical terms."

Using qualitative methodologies, activists’ accounts are collected after the installation of the Convention, after the presentation of the Constitutional Draft and after the Exit Plebiscite. The results show that the previous conflicts favoured the deployment of diverse repertoires at different scales, with the relevance of institutional channels, and that new actors emerged during the period, young people and women, who are renewing the collective action. After a cycle of hope and satisfaction, followed by disillusionment due to the rejection of the Proposal for a New Constitution, activism in the territories is challenged by the need to play a more informative role and dialogue in contexts with heterogeneous positions, and where the intergenerational aspect is reinforced as a motivating principle in the present and towards the future."

The labour integration process is studied from an equity perspective, considering subjective indicators of achievement. For this purpose, job satisfaction as well as the assessment of the skills acquired at the University and their usefulness for the labour market have been investigated. Whether students find a balance between the received training and their job performance or not has been considered too. To do so, we have selected a quantitative methodology, working with the Survey on Labour Market Insertion for University Graduates conducted by the Agency for the Quality of the University System of Catalonia (AQU), years 2014 to 2017. This is a stratified sample catalogued by university degree in which 17,337 and 15,563 students have participated respectively. Results show that some structural features of university graduates, especially being women, and other educational details such as getting good grades or studying a BA degree that does not fall under humanities contribute to configuring a more positive perception of the transition to the labour market. The comparative analysis between the survey's two editions demonstrates the negative effect of the economic crisis as well as some signs of recovery, which are very pronounced in the fields of Engineering and Architecture. Finally, it is concluded that the Bologna reform and the application of competence-based learning have delivered positive results, even though it is still necessary to continue working on policies aimed at monitoring and guiding students in the process of transition from university education to the labour market."

Through a qualitative and local study, experiences from professionals of six educational communities belonging to public schools with an Integration Program in process of implementation due to the inclusion law are analyzed in the three provinces of the Atacama region. The purpose is to reveal unseen realities through the analysis of interviews directed to eighteen educational members: headmasters, social workers and professionals who are part of the Educational Integration Program; the main actors of the current educational process. Through the experiences and arguments of the ones involved in the study; obstacles, enhancements, disagreements, and meaningful elements are made evident. Each one of these help in the scaffolding of theoretical and practical knowledge which mainly refers to the resistance of traditional pedagogical transformation and to the collaborative working developed with multidisciplinary teams, the establishment of innovative practices through curricular adaptions, the importance of students and families’ involvement, emotional education and positive behavior, key elements for assembling inclusive communities."

In 2019, during Chile’s October uprising, graffiti and muralism were at the centre of the street protests. Taking concepts of memory and prefiguration as a theoretical framework, this article examines how visual artist Fab Ciraolo created his narratives of rebellion during October’s uprising and, in turn, posits the potential of contemporary Chilean graffiti and muralism as a repertoire of political action. This article explores the inspiration that social movements have gained from these types of artistic practices and the role the arts, in general, have had as a new repertoire of political action and engagement in politics in Chile."

In 2019, during Chileans’ October social outburst, performing arts were in the centre of the street protests. This article explores the inspiration social movements have gained from artistic practices and the role the arts in general have had as a new form of youth participation and engagement in politics in Chile. Also, this article examines the relation between the lack of formal citizenship education in the Chilean curriculum after the return of democracy and the birth of these new forms of political participation and activism within the youth. Additionally, based on the Chilean case, the article argues the need for new conceptualizations of citizenship education beyond the traditional boundaries of education institutions."

In October 2019, secondary-school and university students organized a massive evasion of the Santiago metro fare. The reason was to protest the 30 pesos increase in the cost of the ticket. This appar-ently small issue detonated the greatest protest movement of the last 30 years. By January 2019, the uprising had left 31 dead and 5,558 people who reported human rights violations, including 331 with ocular trauma or injury to their eyes and 21 suffered damage or loss of the eyeball. In March 2019, protests were eradi-cated from the streets and the development of the movement was slowed down by the powerful action of the Coronavirus. This article explores the impact that the COVID-19 crisis had on citizen movement, and the functionality of the health crisis to establish the de facto authoritarian hyper-controlled state in order to freeze the social crisis. Also, this work identifies the strategy that the Chilean citizen movement developed to survive during 2020, applying Pleyers’s (2020) model of analysis of activism under pandemic as a starting point."

DUCTION; Letters to the editor; School climate; School violence; Subjective theories | ABSTRACT: Introduction: The return to face-to-face classes after the pandemic carried effects that triggered cases of School Violence (SV) in 2022. The newspaper was one of the media that addressed these cases and raised the issue to be discussed by its readers. In this media, letters to the editor are relevant as they show the readers’ opinions on a current event, particularly that of experts or influential people from civil society. This type of public discourse in the press deals with argumentative theorizing on the phenomena of school violence and school climate (SC), so that it can be studied from subjective theories (ST). Methodology: Qualitative methodology was followed, using grounded theory. The analysis included a process of open and axial coding in the 10 letters to the editor selected. The means chosen for the collection of the sample was the Chilean newspaper La Tercera. Results: Among the findings, there was a superordinate ST that establishes insufficient coping with SV in the post-pandemic period. In addition, it was found that most of the STs are action initiators to address SC and SV. Conclusions: The experts’ discourse presents theorizations about the accountability of adults and schools in the work done to address SV, and change on SC work. Students are portrayed as passive subjects, which could limit their moral development and participation in these contexts."

This study employed a narrative approach to analyze the teaching identity of 17 engineers across three groups: those who train future engineers, those who prepare future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers, and those who are training to become STEM educators. Three dimensions of teaching identity were examined: personal, professional, and situational. Findings indicate that university professors construct their identity based on their personal trajectories, whereas future STEM educators emphasize their individual character-istics as key to their performance. Additionally, engineers who teach recognize the need for specific pedagogical training, yet they often rely on peer learning due to limited institutional support. Moreover, among those training to become teachers, professional experience in engineering is valued more highly than teaching practice. These results highlight the signifi-cance of context, career trajectory, and institutional support in shaping the teaching identity of engineers."

The Practicum is an important space for professional identity. The ITE should incorporate moments of reflection, promote collaboration and overcome the dichotomy between academics and pedagogy. The university plays a central role in teacher education. In Europe, there are models of IDF grouped into concurrent, consecutive and mixed. In Spain, the model is consecutive and poses challenges such as training in ethical principles and the theory-practice relationship. This study analyzes the challenges and projections of the Master's Degree in Compulsory Secondary Education and Baccalaureate, Vocational Training and Language Teaching (MAES) from the perspective of coordinators in universities in Andalusia. Through a narrative study, 12 coordinators were interviewed and a polyphonic analysis was carried out with emerging themes. The results show four areas of challenges and projections: the profile and characteristics of the professors, the curriculum, the Practicum activities, and the present and future of MAES students. The results are discussed around the theory-practice articulation, the role of the labor market in the professional future of the teachers and the evaluation of the coordination of the MAES."

In union spaces, peculiarities are observed in the conformation of female teacher leaderships related to the reproduction of stereotypes and gender gaps. However, the study of the experiences of female teachers in these spaces is still incipient. Methodology: In this context, a comparative case study is developed, interviewing 24 teachers in Chile and Spain to analyze their understanding of union work, the concerns and tensions that arise in the exercise of this work. The results show important differences in the way union work is understood, but also common elements on the difficulties that arise in the development of this work associated with the feminization of teaching and union work. Discussion and conclusions: In both groups, this activity is understood as an action of help and care, with differences regarding whether or not to consider it a job and the tensions of work-family conciliation, while other forms of participation are proposed. The contributions of these results for the advancement of teacher unionism and the construction of new struggles and teacher activism are discussed."

The implementation of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) in Spain has arisen conflict in this regard, as it has given rise to the figure of the teacher-researcher-manager-bureaucrat, along with the commercialization of scientific production and the working conditions of teaching staff. This study examines the pedagogical meanings of university teaching in Spain, specifically focusing on two degree programs: the Bachelor's Degree in Primary Education (Case 1) and the Bachelor's Degree in Construction and Building (Case 2). A collective case study is conducted, employing open interviews with instructors who possess different contracts and trajectories in both programs. A reflective thematic analysis is carried out, yielding the following categories for Case 1: Teacher-researcher profile, Initial Teacher Education in practice, and Uncertain future expectations; and the following categories for Case 2: Teacher-professional profile, Teacher interaction from practice, and Job placement expectations. These findings are discussed in relation to how job challenges, the valuation of professional practice, instability in educational objectives, and the influence of the labor market impact the pedagogical meanings of university teaching in these cases. These aspects prompt inquiries into the country's future projects and the societal role of future professionals."

Nonetheless, there exists a multitude of obstacles preventing the political activism of formally organized educators at present, owing to the current predicament faced by conventional associations, the impact of emerging social movements, and a neoliberal context that encourages individual action. In this context, a comparative analysis is conducted using an autoethnographic approach to uncover the protest strategies employed by organized teachers in Chile, Spain, and Portugal.The findings show that shared elements are tied to the recognition of a neoliberal agenda that has influenced educational protests. Therefore, data-driven discourse is a critical factor in teacher unrest and resistance. Furthermore, variations exist between these contexts, influenced by historical associations of backgrounds and other social movements. In Chile, the aesthetics of feminist movements are evident, and in Portugal, the symbol of a red carnation represents new characteristics for teacher participation in their associations. In contrast, Spain is more influenced by unions, leading to a greater emphasis on promoting trade union visibility during demonstrations. We discuss the impact of these protest tactics on the challenges faced by trade union cohesion, which have shaped the history of the Spanish trade union movement."

It analysed how learning ecologies contribute to the development of secondary education teachers, focusing on both contextual and personal dimensions. The research involved a sequential qualitative approach with three phases: documentary research (six official documents and 11 interviews with course coordinators); a case study with an ethnographic approach at a public university (13 observations and 22 unstructured interviews); and three narrative interviews with prospective teachers. Findings revealed that ITE in Spain is marked by a complex interplay of educational policies, institutional practices, and personal trajectories of prospective teachers. The results highlight significant tensions between theoretical training and practical application, alongside the critical role of personal and contextual factors in shaping professional identities. Effective ITE requires a balanced integration of theoretical knowledge and practical experience, emphasising the importance of personal and contextual dimensions in learning ecologies. The findings suggest that fostering collaboration among educational institutions and aligning training programmes with the lived experiences of future teachers can enhance the quality of teacher education."
2494,2,"TITLE: Qualitative evaluation of the feasibility of a national whole-school program for reducing school violence and improving school climate in Chile | KEYWORDS: evaluation; postpandemic; qualitative; school climate; school violence | ABSTRACT: Introduction: Globally, school violence has increased since the return to in-person classes following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Since then, this indicator has become critical, especially in Latin American countries. In this context, the Chilean Ministry of Education, with the support of 17 universities, began in 2022 the design and implementation of a comprehensive educational reactivation policy. This policy included a focus on school climate (convivencia escolar) and mental health through a nationwide intervention program now called the Learning to Live Together Program (Programa A Convivir se Aprende), designed using a whole-school approach. Methods: This study presents the results of a large-scale qualitative evaluation of the initial feasibility of the program, framed in a mixed-methods design. The evaluation identified schools with high, intermediate, and low initial acceptability of the program through 66 interviews and focus groups with 215 participants, including school members, representatives from the Ministry of Education, and university advisors. Results: The reflexive thematic analysis identified four categories featuring six dimensions, 95 codes, and 3,040 textual quotes. The results show a positive acceptance of the program, with high adherence and commitment from the schools. The most highly valued aspects of the program were the conceptual model based on a whole-school approach, the possibility of working with universities in their territories, and school climate networks that were viewed as professional learning communities. Recommendations for future implementation of the program relate to longer implementation time, incorporating actions to promote mental health, expanding participation in the management of school climate, and greater presence of the ministry. Discussion: We discuss these findings in relation to the program’s theory of change, suggesting that the program can achieve its goal of improving school staffs’ skills and competencies in managing school climate and reducing school violence, especially through the strategy of school climate networks by means of capacity building, shared reflexive processes, and emphasis on data-driven decision making."

Análisis de la Reforma al accountability Chileno | KEYWORDS: accountability; education reform; market education; Responsibilities | ABSTRACT: Since 2017, the Chilean school system has been undergoing reforms stemming from the New Public Education (NEP) project. This study analyzed the responsibilities of the new intermediate administrative level, known as Local Public Education Services (SLEP), as outlined in various government documents. A mixed-methods document review was conducted. The textual corpus included Law No. 21.040, the First National Public Education Strategy, and the three documents that outline the Performance Standards at the General, Early Childhood Education, and Technical-Professional Secondary Education levels. The content analysis was qualitative, followed by descriptive quantitative analysis to estimate the frequencies and proportion of responsibilities across five management dimensions: leadership, pedagogy, resources, territory, and school climate. The results identify 114 responsibilities, with an overrepresentation in the leadership and pedagogical management dimensions, to the detriment of the school climate dimension, as well as an imbalance in management tasks without clear accountability mechanisms. The findings are discussed in terms of the implications for the reform of the Chilean educational quasi-market and the challenges that remain in moving towards an approach that challenges the current accountability model."

This research has focused on understanding their role in macro-social negotiation processes with the State, even though teachers’ demands also occur within the school sphere and in the field of micro-political relations. Based on a qualitative study with narrative characteristics of 30 interviews with Chilean teachers, we aimed to describe and understand the role of organizations and organized teachers within the school context. The results show that organized teachers are recognized within the school micro-political framework, and that they are involved in negotiating power with the governing bodies and defending their peers from State regulations. The implications of teachers' associationism at another level of teachers' political struggles are discussed."

In Chile, their participation has made it possible to establish principles of democracy and equity, which date back to the beginning of education systems. In this context, associations have been instrumental in promoting teachers' political participation, being an essential agent for negotiating a transformative role in teaching. However, teaching associations are currently experiencing a moment of crisis that has had an impact on the reference that teachers have for politicising their work. A qualitative study of 30 in-depth interviews with teachers who are organised and active in their work in the classroom describes the role of teachers' associations in the politicisation of teaching practice in Chile. The results indicate that teachers acquire knowledge within the framework of their associations, which allows for a different kind of teaching practice. However, attendance at a teachers' association does not guarantee this learning, but rather the commitment of teachers to their peers and the politicisation of a perspective of differences. The challenges of politicising work as a meaningful framework for teacher resistance and activism are discussed."

A simultaneous comparative case study is conducted in both programs. Each case has a sequential mixed design using the “teaching climate scale conducive to university student learning.” Qualitative interviews are applied to professors and students. The results show that differences favor the Chilean case over the Spanish case in four dimensions: 1) autonomous learning, 2) organization and discipline in the development of the teaching-learning process, 3) values, and 4) evaluation. Qualitatively, dimensions such as teaching role, university policies, and Chile’s seismic nature explain these differences. It is concluded that the Chilean case exhibits the best teacher-student interaction due to having a learning-oriented relationship and due placing more value to enhancing student social engagement."

To this end, a topical narrative study was conducted with teachers from two educational establishments in a prison complex in Chile, through 16 individual narrative interviews and a group interview. The analysis shows a highly precarious and challenging initial state, with little political and institutional support, resulting in different forms of social exclusion. During the pandemic, the suspension of classes exacerbated these difficulties and teachers had to move from improvisation to collaborative work. Currently, teachers confirm ""a historic abandonment"" of education in prisons by public institutions and policies, although it has managed to strengthen its pedagogical identity."

In this scenario, the research objective was to describe how the professional trajectories of 15 Chilean teachers are configured, in the sociopolitical context of the current teaching career. The methodology was qualitative with a biographical approach, through individual-narrative interviews. The design, a case study made up of 5 teachers, forming 3 qualifying groups for the teaching career (Initial, Intermediate, Advanced). Among the main conclusions, a narrative of the vocational motivation stands out when entering to study pedagogy, the fear of professional burnout, the abandonment of the teaching career and the questioning of the standardization of teaching work, by promoting a logic of technification of the pedagogical task."

In Chile, punitive control policies such as the Safe Class Law (Ley Aula Segura) have been adopted. A key actor in the public debate is the Chilean Teachers’ Union, due to its potential impact on new public policies on the issue. Objectives: The aim of this study was to reconstruct the subjective theories of school violence and school climate presented by the Chilean Teachers’ Union after the COVID-19 pandemic, in its public discourse broadcast on the web news. Methods: Based on a documentary study, a case study design and qualitative methodology, embedded in the FONDECYT project No. 1231667, titled “The social construction in Chile of school climate and school violence after the return to face-to-face education,” web news (N = 36) were analyzed in which the Chilean Teachers’ Union explains school violence and school climate after the pandemic. Results: We found subjective theories that explain the meaning of school violence and school climate, and external factors associated with the serious deterioration of these educational dimensions after the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we obtained a set of measures such as inclusive policies, curriculum, participation in the development of educational policies, and refunding public education that teachers propose to solve these phenomena in the future. Discussion: In the context of a union that has historically considered public policies to be non-participative in their formulation and distant from the schools’ reality, these findings have important implications for understanding the arguments of the Teachers’ Union about the need to improve mental health and working conditions as crucial elements for addressing school climate and school violence."

In Chile, the teacher professional development system is incorporated within the teaching career, associating economic recognition with the outcome and performance of the teachers. This system, based on an accountability model, does not consider teachers’ trajectories as situated and collective learning. The objective of this investigation is to describe and analyse catalysts and barriers in the professional development of teachers within in the context of a high stakes’ accountability model. A qualitative study was conducted, in which 30 teachers were interviewed from a narrative approach. The content analysis identified catalysts as the possibility to reflect on their own practice and be recognized through economic incentives. The barriers identified related to limited validation and decontextualition of teacher evaluation, and teachers questioned punitive consequences and the lack of a training approach. These results show a need for professional valorization and structural change for continuous improvement outweighs issues of compensation."

Using qualitative methodology with a narrative approach, 12 in-depth interviews were performed with teachers who participate in different political organizations: professional associations and national, regional and/or school unions. The results show a high valuation of the teaching organization as a validated mechanism of political pressure and participation, associated with social struggle. Adherence to the professional association — College of Teachers — allows the formation of a collective subject that, by also participating in other organizational instances, modulates the social identity of critical teacher. Finally, there is evidence of the need to move forward in new investigations that can rescue the experience of organization of those marginalized voices in a school culture that often individualizes protest and organized action."

Although the discussion among citizens, parliamentarians and researchers has oscillated between a security approach and a democratizing approach to school coexistence, it is still pending to identify how school coexistence is conceptualized and measured in the questionnaires that accompany the national standardized test of the Educational Quality Measurement System (SIMCE). Given the above, we sought to understand this conceptualization and explore the indicators of students and parents in relation to the School Coexistence Indicator reported to each establishment. A mixed sequential qualitative (documentary analysis) and quantitative (secondary analysis of the SIMCE 2014, 2015 and 2017 databases) sequential design study was conducted. The findings show the existence of a narrow conceptualization of school coexistence linked to order, safety and discipline. For their part, the indicators for students and proxies are significantly different from each other. Recommendations are presented for public policy aimed at broadening the construct, revising the weightings, disaggregating the indicator by educational actor, and reporting the results of the evaluation by dimensions."
2506,2,"TITLE: A struggle for translation: An actor-network analysis of Chilean school violence and school climate policies | KEYWORDS: Actor network theory; quality assurance; school climate policy; school violence | ABSTRACT: In the last six years, Chile has carried out major reforms in school climate policy. However, these reforms are tied to two different realities that conflict with each other: a formative reality, which promotes a school climate of local decision-making and the improvement of school performance; and a punitive reality, which prioritizes improvement in the school climate through accountability protocols and regulations. We used Actor-Network Theory to describe the network of actors that underlie these realities. We analyzed key documents and conducted active interviews with actors responsible for the design and implementation of these policies. Results show that the assembled network enacts an accountability reality by means of the Law on Assurance of the Quality of Education, with key devices and s-objects performing the network. However, this enacted reality is at odds with a logic of school improvement that is still defended by the Ministry of Education, an actor that is no longer the main source of translation in the network. These results are discussed in light of the so-called “global triumph” of New Public Management through the dissemination of specific instruments that bring together subjects and objects in enacting the reality of accountability."
2507,0,"TITLE: Educational identity and policies of accountability: The case of Chile Identidad docente y políticas de accountability: El caso de Chile1 | KEYWORDS: Chile; Commitment; Standardization; Teachers; Vocation | ABSTRACT: Accountability policies in Chile are based on a quality education measurement system that includes standardized testing with high consequences, and different threat, punishment and seduction systems for schools that do not improve their academic results. In this context, the identity of teachers is defied. This study sought to analyze the identity of teachers working in the chilean municipal system in the context of accountability policies in this sector. We conducted 22 focused interviews and 4 focus groups with teachers and other educational actors from four educational centers whose socio-educational vulnerability index (IVE) was higher than 75%. The results of the content analysis indicate a standardization of the teaching work, which brings as a consequence both a technification of their identity as well as ways of responding through vocation and professional commitment, despite a discredit of the profession. This perception is shared by the students and their families, who confirm teacher's perception of low social recognition."

The loss of respect for their authority due to this devaluation is confronted through strategies with multiple approaches and consequences, which shows how the teaching role has a profound impact on school coexistence. This study looked for describe and analyze meanings and strategies regarding teacher respect, and its relationship with school coexistence. A study based on Grounded Theory was reached out, interviewing teachers, students, families and school personnel. The content analysis showed a diversity of meanings of teacher respect, and a continuum of strategies that are located in two poles: obedience-authoritarianism, and recognition-appreciation-closeness. The results are discussed around the current policies, the context of socio-educational vulnerability in which the teachers of this study work, and the consequences that these strategies have for a harmonious school coexistence."
2509,0,"TITLE: Teacher education and high stakes accountability: The case of Chile Formación inicial docente y high stakes accountability: El caso de Chile | KEYWORDS: Linguistics; Mathematics; Professional careers; Teacher education | ABSTRACT: Chile is the oldest quasi-market educational model in the world, leading to an Accountability based Educational Policy impacting on a system of professional development focused on the individual and merit-based. This context has promoted an initial formation based on these very principles. The high rewards accountability has led to the division of knowledge based on high or low risk, on the basis of contents measured by standardized national tests, bearing consequences over the teachers imparting these subjects and on their initial formation. Through a qualitative study, the profiles of graduation of the professional careers of Linguistic Pedagogy and Mathematics Pedagogy of every public university in Chile are analyzed. Results show an over-evaluation of these fields of knowledge and disciplinary domains, an emphasis on social adaptation of teachers, exceptions on these being quite marginal. These results are discussed regarding the need of an integral initial formation of teachers, as well as their role as intellectuals."

However, different logics of understanding and intervening in SC underlie these legal bodies. In order to account for the contradictions and critical nodes of instruments that conform Chile´s SC public policy, we performed a documentary analysis of laws and other key documents. Using content analyses, we identified four critical nodes: contradiction between declaration and measurement of quality of education; explicit arrangements for institutional sanctions, which contrasts with ambiguity about institutional supports; contradictory understandings about SC; and differential treatment for public and private schools. We discuss the possibilities of promoting a democratic SC in a policy environment that is highly oriented by accountability."

This study seeks to understand the work of the inspectors working for this new government body. By preparing a qualitative design of a single case study, in-depth interviews were carried out with all of the inspectors working for a Superintendencia's regional office. The findings reveal tension between the work of inspecting and assessing, calling into question the inspectors' role and professional performance. This tension is dissipated through negotiation strategies within the regional inspectorate and with the schools. School community policies analyzed through the prism of accountability produce punitive atmospheres and initiatives as ways of improving a harmonious environment within schools."
2512,2,"TITLE: School and community factors involved in Chilean students’ perception of school safety | KEYWORDS: community; school climate; school safety; school violence; students | ABSTRACT: Identifying and understanding predictors of school safety perceptions is important due to its consequences for students. However, it is not clear what school-related factors most contribute to explaining students’ perception of school safety, and how they relate to community-related factors such as neighborhood safety. The purpose of this study was to understand the factors associated with Chilean elementary and middle school students’ perceptions of school safety. We used a sample of 5,455 students from low socioeconomic status public schools, and analyzed the predictive value of peer physical and verbal victimization; teacher and school staff victimization; teacher's social support; and perception of safety in the students’ neighborhoods on perceptions of school safety. Findings showed that although different forms of school violence, particularly peer physical victimization and physical and sexual victimization from teachers and school staff, contribute to students’ perception of school safety, the highest contribution came from students perceiving their neighborhoods as unsafe. In contrast, teacher social support contributed to increased levels of perceived school safety. We discuss the need for school-based interventions that address physical victimization and engage teachers in prosocial and less punitive approaches to foster a positive and safe school climate, and in fostering school–community partnerships."
2513,2,"TITLE: Critical analysis of the Chilean law of school violence Análisis crítico de la ley de violencia escolar de Chile | KEYWORDS: Discourse analysis; Law; Public policy; School violence | ABSTRACT: In 2001 Chile enacted the School Violence Law, after three failed attempts by the legislature. We present here the results of an analysis of this Law, based on critical documentary analysis. Results indicate the exercise of disciplinary power and the prescription of a hierarchical oversight by adult school personnel. There is evidence of techniques to divide individuals before a normalizing punishment, whereby the student is pictured as subject of punitive action, with faults scored with consequences that may go all the way up to the exclusion from school and society. School community life is conceived as a situational variable that inhibits violence. Adult school personnel are held responsible for it, making co-construction invisible and thus also making invisible the joint responsibility of students and legal guardians. The discourse has the effect of making criminal law rationality prevails over pedagogical rationality, diminishing the school's formative function."
2514,0,"TITLE: Chilean preservice teachers and reading: a first look of a complex relationship | KEYWORDS: Motivation; Reading; Teacher education | ABSTRACT: Two pillars of the curricula for primary education and early childhood education in Chile are, respectively, the formal teaching of reading and the promotion of the pleasure of reading. These two objectives depend, in part, on the relationship that teachers themselves establish with reading. Previous studies have been critical, suggesting that teachers seem to act as “false readers,” endangering the formation of new readers. Under this premise, this research investigated the reading life of future teachers who are trained, among other things, to mediate subsequent learning, as well as the acquisition and development of committed readers. The study focused on the importance of reading, preservice teachers’ motivation to read different types of texts, reading habits, and actual reading done during 1 year. The research participants were 365 prospective Chilean early childhood (n = 164) and primary education (n = 201) teachers, who responded to Likert-type and open-ended questions. In line with previous studies, we observed teachers’ high reading valuation but low effective reading praxis. Regarding the importance of reading, we observe reading utility as a first dimension while “enjoyment” or “connecting with my history” are the least valuable dimensions. The implications of these findings for initial teacher training—and especially the role of children’s literature in this framework—are discussed."

In this regard there are several proposals. One holds that part of the central systems within the framework of the theory of modular Jerry Fodor. However, Asa Kasher raises a hypothesis based on Fodor modulates architecture, but it gives a character to the modular least some aspects of pragmatic interpretation. In this work we argue that both proposals are incorrect due to inconsistencies with the empirical findings on pragmatic processing. Rather, we support a hypothesis based on the massive modularity of mind, where evolutionary considerations led to the emergence of a pragmatic sub-module that is part of a more general theory of mind module."

This article presents an experience of mediation through the assessment of six digital reflective portfolios from future Chilean teachers at a University of Chile. This potfolios were developed during the academic years 2022 and 2023. The assessment of the portfolios was conducted considering frameworks on digital literacies. The objective of creating portfolios was to showcase the digital literacies of pre-service teachers and present experiences of literature mediation that integrate the pedagogy of multiliteracies. The digital literacies present in portfolios are expressed through internet language, such as the use of memes, gamification, and itineraries thar reflect a multimodal design. The digital platforms used are those recommended for educational field. The experiences of literature mediation, as showcased in this portfolios, incorporate aspects of the digital literacies of future educators. Reading is mediated through cultural and digital expressions known to their students rather than solely through literary texts. In conclusion, there is a need to create training opportunities that raise awareness among future teachers about their integration into mediation processes that empower student. This approach aims to address the challenges posed by literary reading in schools."
2517,0,"TITLE: Approach to the transmedia profile of teachers in training for the mediation of literature Aproximación al perfil transmedia de docentes en formación para la mediación de la literatura | KEYWORDS: digital literacy; mass media; multiliteracies; reading; teacher training | ABSTRACT: In recent times, reading has undergone substantial changes: does not read the same nor in the same way. The appearance of transmedia narratives has changed the way fiction is created, diffused and read. These narratives can improve the literary learning in young readers and expand the concept of literature at the same time. This proposal aims to approach the transmedia profile of teachers in initial training, in a context of literary education, in order to identify what their skills are in this area, how they have learned to develop them and what training needs they reveal, as well as the perceptions they have in relation to the digital fact and formal education. A study with a quantitative approach, with a non-experimental descriptive design, has been carried out through a closed-question questionnaire, to 86 participants. The data collected was processed through the SPSS Statistics program. The results show how the majority of future teachers affirm that they learned transmedia content production skills informally, but they highlight the need to be trained in interpretation, reflection and evaluation of transmedia content in formal contexts of learning. Finally some proposals and challenges are included."

Chilean program’s literary corpus consists of mostly classics and teaching them requires various strategies. Novice teachers have to teach this type of literature when they start to work in a school, and they have to fulfill a series of requirements that make their mediation complex. Considering this problem, our aim is to analyze the reception of a digital educational hypertext on a group of six Spanish teachers in Santiago de Chile during the 2017 academic year. The purpose is to find their needs, perceptions, and beliefs related to the mediation of this literature through digital use on secondary classroom. Methodological approach used has a qualitative focus on a Grounded Theory systematic design. The instruments applied were interviews, stories of reading life, and a digital multimodal hypertext designed for this purpose. Resulting categories were consolidated through content analysis. Findings reveal that when these novice teachers take on their institution’s mediation practices, they are apprehensive with using digital means to teach literature and their incipient teaching practice deepens their digital educational literacy lack. It is concluded that their relationship with literature and their perceptions to teach it affect mediation and interaction with educational hypertext, hence, reading identity and multimodal digital hypertext should be taken into consideration in basic teacher training"
2519,0,"TITLE: Academic writing strategies in university students from three disciplinary areas: design and validation of an instrument | KEYWORDS: academic writing; higher education; instrument; strategies; students | ABSTRACT: It is acknowledged that writing strategies are highly important not only for their usefulness in the process of text production but also for their value as a learning technique, as they involve the use of cognitive and metacognitive operations. Various international studies have validated scales to measure their use and have helped characterize expert and non-expert university writers. However, regarding specific strategies in Spanish as a mother tongue, further research is still needed in the context of higher education students. This study aimed to develop a standardized measurement instrument to identify university students' use of academic writing strategies according to disciplinary area. The sample consisted of 290 students from the Humanities and Social Sciences, Health Sciences, and Engineering from a regional university in Chile. A Likert-type scale was applied whose design was based on a thorough review of successful instruments from different parts of the world. The results indicate that the developed instrument is appropriate for higher education contexts and across different disciplinary areas."

This article explores second language learners' perceptions of feedback as a teaching and learning strategy. In second language teaching, it is necessary to know learners' previous knowledge and experiences regarding how they receive feedback, since this practice has an impact on the improvement of writing. To this end, in this research, an online questionnaire was distributed to 202 participants taking an English course to ask them about: types of feedback received, preferences regarding feedback, effectiveness of feedback and experiences with feedback. Analysis of their responses, quantitative and qualitative, shows that participants have preferences about how they expect feedback to be given, although these are not consistent with what theory suggests as effective. In addition, participants argue that their experience with feedback is related to a rather normative correction in which teachers focus on attending to microstructural aspects; therefore, students' view of textual quality is linked to normative processes. These aspects are important to address in the development of writing classes for second-language learners."

The methodology is qualitative with an exploratory scope and is based on a sample of 20 first-year journalism students from a Chilean university. Two instruments are applied: 1) making an informative text and 2) a think-aloud protocol when rewriting their texts. The results show that when student review and rewrite their texts, they embrace their professors’ feedback and can even assess their texts on their own. It is observed also that there is a relationship between feedback comprehension and the improvements students can make. It can be concluded that the use of cognitive techniques allows improving the understanding of student metacognitive processes when revising and rewriting their texts."

The methodology used is qualitative through a case study that surveyed ten professors from different disciplines at a university in the Chilean city of Concepción. A semi-structured interview is applied to conduct a content analysis with the support of the Nvivo version 12 software. The results show that there are differences in the teaching of writing according to disciplinary area. However, there are also similarities between the shortcomings detected in students and the professors' expectations about writing. The professors surveyed concur that various aspects of student writings are deficient, including the discursivesemantic and the composition process. It is concluded that such deficiencies are observed in different disciplines, suggesting that they constitute a transversal issue in higher education."

The surveyed sample is composed of 104 participants, 52 journalism students from the Biobío region (Chile) and 52 professional journalists. The approach of the study is mixed and the analysis methodology applies a lexical availability model. The results show that the available lexicon of first and fifth year students is similar, revealing a poorly specialized lexicon. Journalism students view writing as a process of expression, communication, and transmission of ideas. In contrast, professional journalists have greater specialization than journalism students since they show use of sources and linguistic precision. It is concluded that the applied lexical availability model shows mental lexical changes in the sample surveyed and reveals the link between lexical availability and academic writing proficiency in journalism."

Writing is a complex skill, even more so, if the student does not handle the generic structure of the institutionalized practices imposed on Higher Education. Purpose. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of direct and metalinguistic focused written corrective feedback (WCF) on information structuring connectors. Methods. This quantitative study compares focused WCF effectiveness in 39 subjects who are divided into three groups: the first one is the control group, which did not receive feedback, the second is the experimental group 1 that was corrected through direct WCF and the third one corresponds to experimental group 2 that received feedback through metalinguistic cues. Results. The findings indicate that WCF is effective for the experimental groups. There is a significant decrease in the number of errors of information-structuring connectors in experimental group 2, while experimental group 1 shows a reduction, but without statistical significance. As for the control group, it did not present improvements. In addition, the development of writing tasks corrected through metalinguistic WCF strategies led to textual cohesion improvement with the accurate use of connective devices. Conclusions. It is important to reflect on the use of focused feedback as part of the writing process, firstly, because writing cannot be taught without reviewing a student's writing, and secondly, considering that focused feedback supports the noticing of errors and decreases teacher correction time."

We use a gender perspective to investigate the structural and power configurations affecting women, as well as an intersectional perspective given the complex and dynamic configuration of the main axes of inequality that impact the experiences of female academics. Technically, we reviewed secondary sources, especially indexed journals. Substantively, we highlighted the articulation of gender and academic regimes as a mechanism of subjection, turning universities into spaces that produce and reproduce gender inequalities."

The premise at the base is that these experiences are configured from the co-occurrence and articulation of a series of social relations, which configure particular experiences of work and life. An intersectional and gender perspective is adopted to recognize and problematize these co-occurrences and complex configurations. The methodology used was qualitative. In-depth interviews and observations were carried out in the homes of the workers. One of the main findings refers to the interweaving and mutual conditioning between class and gender relations, which subject female workers to the home, and the double performance of productive and reproductive tasks."

The operations of these enterprises have not had a beneficial impact on the area. Rather has been confronted by a dual predicament: temporary work and low wages. As well, the environment is threatened as the agricultural frontier extends into the foothills of the nearby mountain ranges. In addition, there is evidence of increased land concentration and control of water on the part of the agribusinesses, to the detriment of the livelihoods of small producers. The loss of land and water is the other face of a peasant proletarization process that is ultimately functional to the agribusinesses needs for financial and human resources."

Beyond thoroughly scrutinizing these immigration enforcement changes, it also examines their underlying motivations, as well as their consequences and paradoxes. In this regard, the chapter explores legal and policy arrangements implemented in the 2010s, which gave shape to a markedly managerial model in which removal practices took centre stage, specifically focusing on the expeditious deportation of so-called “criminal aliens” - in a crimmigration fashion. In addition, the chapter examines recent changes in the field of immigration enforcement, which have resulted in the increasing consolidation of a punishment model, in which criminalized noncitizens are prevailingly incarcerated, rather than deported. Finally, the chapter reflects on the ambivalences surrounding migration control and shows the main challenges of the Chilean criminal justice system in dealing with criminalized noncitizens."
2529,9,"TITLE: Heterogeneous borders: Migrant workers in Northern Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: If we consider borders as heterogeneous migration management apparatuses, Chile stands out by having strikingly Janus-faced border policies, which are extremely open and tolerant with regard to capital and commodities flows, but closed and almost obsessively exclusionary for allegedly risky immigrants. These bipolar and contradictory policies are especially evident in the North of Chile. On the one hand, this region has been a free trade zone since the mid-1970s. On the other hand, it has been a privileged site for the implementation of security-based border protection plans (such as the so-called Northern Border Plan). These two dimensions of border policies have various consequences on the ground. They reinforce the deportability of migrant workers coming from Bolivia and Peru. Additionally, they enable and at the same time mask the exploitative conditions endured by the noncitizens working in this free trade zone."

This paper argues that the literature has reached an impasse. I argue that overly ‘alternative’ readings conceptualise Alternative Food Networks (AFNs) as a more embedded form of economic exchange, while neoliberal readings represent them as a case of marketisation. This paper systematically reviews AFNs literature and contends that a deeper engagement with Polanyian geographies enables a more nuanced approach to evaluating alternatives and their socio-political significance. Analytically and normatively, ‘alternatives’ need not be radically ‘other’, nor seen as having been co-opted by the neoliberal order."
2532,5,"TITLE: The elderly and social protection | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter analyses the social protection needs and responses for old-age people living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In particular, it assesses policy responses for economic security, the challenges for healthcare systems on the rise of non-communicable diseases, and institutional and funding options for the expansion of long-term care systems. It introduces the primary debates concerning the provision of social pensions as a response of irregular labour trajectories and contributions to social insurances, followed by initiatives to reduce the costs that a family should afford for access to appropriate treatments. Lastly, the provision of long-term care is still far enough of the coverage standards in LMICs, in terms of funding, personnel, and adequacy of the supply-side. To conclude, social protection for old-age people is dealing with new and emergent problems, in the context of rapid demographic ageing."

In Chile, interactions between design and craft have increased significantly since the 1990s due to new national and international cultural policies. Efforts have been made to safeguard tradition or induce innovation through professional design to promote craft products and mediate between local and global values. This study examines the tensions in design-craft interactions, unpacking the hegemonic and paternalistic design approaches that often overshadow artisans’ innovations. Using historical and ethnographic analysis, this study focuses on Pomaire, a village renowned for its pottery tradition and cultural significance that has faced criticism from the Chilean cultural establishment for a perceived loss of tradition, with institutions favouring specific cultural expressions and modern design over artisans’ strategies. This research highlights the frictions between design and crafts in pursuing innovation and development, showing how institutional frameworks influence the recognition, valuation and commercialisation of artisanal production. It also contributes to our understanding of the power dynamics between designers and artisans, emphasising artisans’ agency in shaping their traditions amidst socioeconomic changes."

In order to unpack this perspective, we present how their poetic exploration of ontological and epistemological questions about Latin/South America led to their performance of the Travesía de Amereida (1965), a radical poetic journey oriented around crossing and being crossed by the continental interior lands, and to the subsequent invention of the epic poem Amereida (1967). By examining the different Acts performed during the Travesía and analysing excerpts from the poem, we establish how the School situated actions together with the tropes of the unknown, or not-knowing, and the Interior Sea, as original ways to critically confront and question the coloniality imposed upon and still present in the continent. Concomitantly, we stress how this geo-poetic perspective grounded within the School generated a radical turn and delinking of the academicist episteme in design, which provides stimulating perspectives not only for design studies developed in the region but also for the field of cultural studies."

This study aimed to analyze academic emotions and their prediction of university adaptation and intention to drop out. Methods: The study was quantitative, explanatory, and cross-sectional. A total of 295 university students participated. Academic emotions were assessed with the short version of The Achievement Emotions Questionnaire, adaptation to university life with the reduced version of the Student Adjustment to College Questionnaire, and intention to drop out with three items designed to measure this variable. Results: Differences were identified in the emotions experienced during classes and study by students according to the year of entry. We found that males report experiencing emotions such as enjoyment and hope more during evaluations. Discussion: Generally, students report positive emotions in their academic experience. Positive emotions predict adaptation to university life and the intention to study."

This work is an ethnographic study based upon systematic observations of daily life within an educational space. An example is presented in which the practices of care and social interactions in a spontaneous activity during recess, which involves protecting an insect, are described. The findings demonstrate that the cultural value of respect underpins the activities performed by the girls. The presence of synchronous, collective organization, flexibly assembled and coordinated through non-verbal forms of communication was observed. The findings are discussed taking into account the LOPI model and the Mapuche educational model, reinforcing the ongoing repertoire of cultural practices learned inside of the family and community space."

However, multiple barriers at the national and global levels still hinder the effectiveness of this engagement. Based on ethnographic research, this article analyses how non-state actors from two organisations−Ecos and the Chilean Indigenous Collective on Climate Change−perceive their participation in national climate governance. We conducted thirty-six semi-structured interviews with participants of two groups committed to climate action, one led by civil society organisations and the other convened by the state and composed of Indigenous Peoples leaders, and also engaged in participant observation. Although their motivations are diverse, all share the common goal of addressing socio-ecological inequalities through responses that emerge from their territories. However, these groups show that both national climate change policy and the international climate governance scenario continue to consider the participation of non-state actors as marginal, sym-bolic, and instrumental."

These changes can significantly impact communities living in close interdependence with their territories, such as Indigenous Peoples. Furthermore, these impacts are often entangled and reinforced by other ecological and social processes that affect how communities organise themselves. Drawing from ethnographic research complemented by the life story of a Pewenche woman, this article analyses the intertwined effects of climate change and state policy on the knowledge and seasonality of the Pewenche People in the Southern Andes, Chile. As a result of extensive exploitation of the territory, the implementation of development programmes and the current impacts of climate change, the Pewenche are facing numerous changes that directly affect the rhythms and frequencies that have historically shaped the seasons while impacting their activities, livelihoods and traditions. Their transhumance cycles have been affected, and their economies and calendars must adjust to the new rhythms imposed by state policy. The multiple seasonalities that come into play affect how the Pewenche identify themselves, construct meanings about social life, and position themselves vis-à-vis the state. A reflection on what it means to be Pewenche today has been opened. The bewilderment calls for action and policies that recognise the value of traditional ecological knowledge in fostering resilience and maintaining cultural identity, can respond to the changes and, at the same time, maintain the balance."

Factores que limitan la adaptación transformadora al cambio climático en Lonquimay, Chile | KEYWORDS: climate change; Indigenous Peoples; local adaptation; local impacts; transformation; transformative adaptation | ABSTRACT: Recent studies show that Indigenous Peoples can contribute to transformative adaptation – the reduction of long-term vulnerability by profound and system-wide changes of the factors and paradigms that construct it. However, the factors that constrain communities’ actions, and thus their contributions to such transformation, have yet to be addressed in depth. This article analyses the transformative potential of local adaptations to climate change in Pewenche communities living in Lonquimay, southern Chile, through the framework of the three spheres for sustainable transformation. Through 20 semi-structured interviews, three focus group discussions, and 75 individual and 74 household surveys, we found that although the Pewenche try to respond to climate change impacts, existing power dynamics and structural inequalities embedded in the national political and economic system implicate that their responses are mainly short-sighted and aimed at generating transformations in the practical sphere. Some of their strategies even reinforce capitalist structures and unsustainable external dependencies. The barriers the Pewenche face highlight the urgent need for us, as a society, to address the root causes of inequity that produce vulnerability and limit the transformative capacity of Indigenous communities in the first place."

Una revisión etnográfica de la experiencia chilena | KEYWORDS: Chile; climate policy; ethnography of the state; Indigenous Peoples; participation | ABSTRACT: Indigenous Peoples gain prominence in global climate change debates. Nevertheless, their involvement in national climate governance remains marginal. This article analyses the consideration of Indigenous Peoples’ participation in the Chilean climate governance through an ethnography of the state conducted between 2017 and 2020. A documentary review of national climate policy between 1995 and 2020, participant observation and 41 semi-structured interviews were conducted. The findings show that, although recent progress, Indigenous Peoples’ participation does not meet the standards of intercultural participation. Nor are there mechanisms in place to enable collaboration and to position Indigenous Peoples as agents in the face of climate change. The Chilean case illustrates the type of recognition given to Indigenous Peoples in international climate policy, and therefore its analysis allows for the identification of barriers to effective collaboration. As long as these barriers remain unaddressed, an increase in Indigenous Peoples’ vulnerability is at risk. We also lose the opportunity to promote the institutional transformation processes necessary to respond to climate change. More efforts are needed at the national level to enhance Indigenous Peoples’ participation in the UNFCCC."

It is based on qualitative research whose main methodological techniques were participant observation and in-depth interview. The text draws on the approaches of decolonial and Indigenous feminisms to account for the different tensions expressed in the political trajectories of these women, linked to issues such as gender, class and their urban Mapuche identity. The article reveals that the political participation of indigenous women is heterogeneous. However, something that characterizes it is their work in the formation of networks and the search for alternatives, both in autonomous and institutional spaces."

The questionnaire design is based on a literature review. The Delphi technique is applied for content validation and intentional sampling is employed. Thirteen experts in the field of initial teacher training and inclusive education participated. Three iterations are conducted over four months. The results show the theoretical analysis associated with the authors, which presents the fundamental competencies required by an inclusive teacher. They also show the rounds process, leading to the final version of the questionnaire. In conclusion, the Delphi technique is confirmed as a valid tool and the profile of an inclusive teacher is determined to be comprehensive."

The methodology is qualitative and first and second order content analyses are applied. The total sample consists of 26 universities, 11 public and 15 private. The length for teacher education degree programs ranges from eight to 10 semesters. The results show that these programs’ components demand a global inclusive training proposal. Diversity is observed, but some universities only incorporate it in a few curricular activities. Therefore, updating teacher-training programs with human and material resources is imperative to develop these degree programs fully. In conclusion, educational institutions in charge of training new teachers have a duty to double-down on their efforts to incorporate educational inclusion, transversally and decisively, in the initial training and education of teachers."

For this, a cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out in 341 writing tasks, made up of 70,635 words. The main results show that level A2 produced 248 placements and level B1, 216. Consequently, this type of placements considered as elementary decreases in intermediate levels to give way to the acquisition and learning of more complex placements. These results suggest that from the first levels of Spanish proficiency the teaching of placements by ELE teachers is made explicit."

For this, a corpus was built consisting of its editorials in the period in which the three were published. At the same time, in the period that extends from 1987 to 2011, the years in which a change of ownership of the Executive Branch in Argentina occurred, although not necessarily through an electoral process: 1989, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2011. The methodological approach that guides the research is discourse analysis. Two categories of analysis are identified: the social representations of the discursive tradition, on the one hand, and of the Argentine Church, on the other.

Una propuesta descriptiva a través de 6 casos de migración mediatizada | KEYWORDS: Mass Media; Migrations; Social Imaginaries; Social Representations; Symbolic Structure of Adjustment | ABSTRACT: In this study, we propose a descriptive analysis of qualitative nature to establish elements of convergence on certain discourses around migration from one of the concepts raised by the sociologist Manuel Antonio Baeza: symbolic adjustment structure. The irruption of new discourses and ideas about migrations is determined from its dissemination on the media and its impact on intersubjectivity. The mass media act as transmitters of social meanings, providing representations of reality that emanate from the socially shared imaginary. Thus, this proposal is interested in the relevance of the concept of “symbolic adjustment structure” for the investigation of migration from the fields of social significance-representations and imaginaries-conveyed in the press. The main objectives of the study are the detection of representations and imaginaries and the proposal of the symbolic structure of adjustment to explain the migratory social reality. This qualitative article focuses on six cases that have been dealt with on media platforms. A sample of news selected from Latin American, North American, and European written communication media and agencies was analyzed through the operationalization of the framing theory by analysis with MAXQDA and content analysis. The findings show that the symbolic structure of adjustment in relation to migration is constituted from an imaginary of fear and interiorizing of otherness; at the same time, these imaginaries nurture social representations that relate immigrants with negativity, problems, and irregularity."

To do this, a theoretical and reflective work is deployed with the aim of clarifying the three social meanings established here: social imaginaries, social representations, and discursive re-presentations. At the same time, it seeks to present a taxonomy in planes of meaning, corresponding to the particularities and fields of action of social imaginaries (deep plane), social representations (middle plane of transition) and discursive representations (superficial plane). This epistemic work, which contributes to the conceptual clarification of the three notions discussed, offers theoretical support for future research and a new way of approaching social meanings."

It is a cartographic study, and as such, it considers those approaches, methodologies and results that are more relevant, which allow a ""state of the research"" to be sketched out. It is not, therefore, an exhaustive signing of each paper or thesis to which it can be linked with the field indicated, due to the large volume of products associated directly or indirectly with the so-called ""social imagery"". Semi-structured questionnaires were applied to researchers in the area, research progress was reviewed and the most cited scientific articles were analyzed, allowing a content analysis to be applied. It was observed that the authors and theories with which they work are diverse and propose a conceptual crossing that extends to the methodological plane. It is concluded that imagery and social representations have become a good tool to understand reality and that facilitates research questions about the past and present of the relevant and the everyday."

We systematically reviewed 82 bibliographic sources published between 2000 and 2020 and analyzed them in light of a critical and feminist perspective employing a qualitative content analysis. Based on our analysis, we characterized old age from the main paradigms related to the design of public policies for the elders in the region: the need-based aid policies, active aging, the rights-based approach, and the gender approach. We also note the need to incorporate an intersectional guideline to public policies for older age that recognizes the heterogeneity in the aging process. Finally, we reflect on the challenge of building locally situated perspectives that address the inequalities that characterize Latin American territories."

Studies carried out between 2010 and 2021 on the aging experiences of older people with disabilities, members of the LGBT community, migrants, and Indigenous peoples were reviewed. The literature review was guided by the SALSA (Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis) method. The results were analyzed by group, showing central themes for each one: for the disability group, limitations in old age as generators of deterioration and decline, making social participation impossible; for the LGBT group, the weight of social norms that restrict the expression of dissident sexual and gender identities; for the migration group, the intersection with the theme of care and the ambivalences linked to a binational life course; and for the Indigenous group, the tensions between the worldview of First Nations people and the cultural changes impacting their social role. Transversal discursive axes were identified in the corpus, highlighting the unequal and exclusionary old age that many people experience at the same time as the capacity for agency, reinvention, and resistance that these elderly people manifest in their daily practices."

The data considers the period of 22 days since the creation and spread of the hashtag, which took place 5 days into the 2019 uprising in Chile. This paper follows a corpus-based critical discourse analysis that examines the most frequently used adjectives, that is, predication strategies, that characterise the politician, as well as their (de)legitimating function through the identification of van Leeuwen’s legitimation strategies. Results showed that what started as gendered aggression evolved towards a focus on social class and political stance due to the politician’s characteristics and those of the sociohistorical context where the aggressions originated. Furthermore, it was found that the politician’s anti-democratic values were used to justify abuse against her, presenting it as reasonable."

In this context, women began to organize themselves in public spaces to improve their living conditions in different spheres. This article analyses the contribution of Amanda Labarca to the organization of the first feminist institutions in Chile (1910-1922). It looks at this from a cultural-historical perspective to understand the implications that such women’s organizations had on the country’s progress at the time, drawing on both primary and secondary sources of evidence. The findings show that Labarca played a leading role in the then incipient Chilean feminist movement, as materialized by her leadership in the creation of the Círculo de Lectura in 1915. She also played an active role in various women’s groups that evolved into academic, cultural, and political organizations that were consolidated between 1930-1950."

The reference to administrative acts raises a series of questions regarding the role of these norms in the configuration of the criminal offense and the extent to which the criminal norm can be determined by the content of said administrative act. This problem cannot be adequately addressed without a reflection on the way in which criminal law interacts with norms and evaluations from other areas of the legal system. Based on a critical analysis of these arguments, this paper provides an alternative explanation regarding the basis and scope of this relationship."

However, the analysis of unemployment insurance (UI) in developing economies with large informal sectors is in its infancy, with few papers providing solid empirical evidence. This paper therefore makes several contributions: first, it applies Chetty’s 2008 landmark work on UI to a transition economy (Chile) and shows that the moral hazard effects expected by policy makers, who designed the system are minimal, while liquidity effects were entirely neglected. Second, it demonstrates that it is not enough merely to quantify effects such as moral hazard, but to understand their causes as unemployment generated by moral hazard or liquidity constraints has different welfare implications and should therefore result in different policies. By means of an RDD, this paper analyses the Chilean UI system using a large sample of administrative data, which allows for an extremely precise analysis of how the system works, thus providing invaluable empirical lessons for other countries."

2558,0,"TITLE: Feeling like ‘the ham of the sandwich’: The contested professional identities of school-based early childhood educators in Chile | KEYWORDS: early childhood educators; professional identities; school-based early childhood settings | ABSTRACT: Present-day early childhood educators face the challenge of producing their professional identities in highly neo-liberal contexts, negotiating contested discourses on professionalism, education quality and the overall purpose of early childhood education. While it has been suggested by critical scholarship that the early childhood workforce responds to these challenges by developing a unified professional identity, the author contends that particular contexts of practice (such as schools) and the schoolification of early childhood education may produce fragmentation within the workforce. This is crystallised in the figure of the school-based early childhood educator, whose professional practice lies somewhere between that of a kindergarten educator and a schoolteacher. As school-based early childhood education is not perceived as proper early childhood practice by kindergarten educators, school-based educators struggle to identify with this group of practitioners. Drawing on a psychoanalytically informed qualitative study with early childhood educators, the author discusses some of these tensions and proposes the notion of liminal identity (an intermediate space of becoming where identities – among other possibilities – may be examined and reimagined) as a starting point for the exploration of this emergent type of professional subjectivity in the context of an increasing provision of early childhood education in school settings. The author calls for a destabilisation of oversimplified understandings of the relation between educators and their contexts of practice, and the acknowledgement that educators experience and respond to the struggles of the profession in diverse and complex ways."

This leads to a highly feminized composition of early childhood education workforce, in which, despite the recurrent prochildhood discourses, the job of early childhood educators is understood as easy and instinctive that does not require professional training. This is part of an epistemic injustice regarding the patriarchal valuation of knowledge and practices of the profession. It is crucial, from a gender perspective, to deconstruct these discourses anchored in the educational level and examine the symbols, experiences, positioning and exercise of educators in their professional role. The article is a theoretical-reflective essay that aims to analyze the dilemmas of the notion of professionalism at this educational level and develop a proposal from a feminist perspective of the ethics of care."

Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s theoretical framework and building on relevant scholarship focussed on HE decision-making and choices, it introduces two dual-headed conceptual tools which allow a grasp of relevant differences between social classes: firstly, channelling micro-practices and pushing micro-practices; and secondly, horizons of reference and horizons of potentialities. Through analysing forty-six semi-structured qualitative interviews with pupils from thirteen different secondary schools, this study shows that HE aspirations in the dominant class are experienced as the natural pathway towards university; in the intermediate class, the possibility of HE is taken as a demand of society; while for those in dominated positions, aspirations are rather influenced by uncertainties regarding the future."

Here, we review the results of our studies generated at field trials, and we discuss the crop response to different sources of nitrogen fertilization, as well as the response of cacao to Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium (NPK) interaction. Ammonium sulfate significantly increased yield and fat seed in cacao compared to calcium nitrate and urea. Moreover, leaf nutrient movement during the productive season is described, finding substantial differences among elements and their leaf stages. We also discuss the effect of decreased solar radiation on growth and physiological traits. Mesh was used to reduce solar radiation. Shaded plants significantly reduced stomatal conductance; however, no significant effects on growth and foliar nutritional content were found, but there was an evident genotype effect. Although ammonium sulfate acidifies the soil compared to other N sources, its application improves yield, suggesting crop adaptation to acid soils, typically those of the Amazon region, and ammonium affinity. On the other hand, shade in the Amazon region conditions can alter physiological traits but does not affect plant growth, suggesting acclimatization to radiation modification."

The emergence of new, low-cost communication channels and the speed of social networks put pressure on these agencies’ key role in satisfying local markets and audiences. This article seeks to understand how international news agencies adapt to these new models and processes in Chile. Based on 16 semi-structured interviews with professionals from the most important agencies with offices in Chile (AP, Reuters, AFP, EFE, and Xinhua), the results of this article show an undermined professional status due to the casualization of correspondent work and even its dismantling, findings which are consistent with previous studies in other contexts. However, this article identifies local particularities of this work that navigate between the tensions of a political economy and professional roles in a scarcely studied journalistic culture, marked by the flexibilization and precariousness of working conditions. In this way, correspondents verbalize the dismantling of their status (unknown), their working conditions (precarious), and their professional boundaries (multifaceted)."

Current research has paid little attention to this problem at the local level in non-Western and peripheral media systems. By qualitatively analyzing six case studies of local news digital media in Chile, this article explores the connection between digital media business models and territory. The main findings suggest that the territorial dimension is most visible in media sustainability, community-building, and journalistic value. A single analytical model for both national and local media may be inadequate; therefore, a contextual and comprehensive approach to each media ecosystem is suitable to better understand media business models."

El periodismo chileno en la serie de ficción audiovisual “Bala Loca” (chilevision, 2016) | KEYWORDS: chilean transition; journalism; public space; television fiction series | ABSTRACT: Journalists, photographers, war correspondents, or media owners are attractive characters for audiovisual fiction. Television and streaming platforms have portrayed them as heroes or villains, as well as constructed audiovisual imaginaries about iconic cases (such as Watergate or abuses in the Catholic Church in the US) or as a cog in the wheel of power elites. However, both the production and analysis of this type of work focuses on mainstream industries, such as Hollywood or some European countries. We know less about the audiovisual portrayal of journalism in audiovisual productions for television or platforms in Latin America. The analysis of the Chilean series for free-to-air television, Bala Loca, allows us to explore the imaginaries -simultaneously complementary and contradictory- about journalism and the media in a post-dictatorial and neoliberal society. Then, this article contributes to better understanding this type of audiovisual productions in similar contexts. This reading is anchored in audiovisual and cultural studies and in qualitative methodologies focused on the production (its narratives, representations, characters, and dramatic arcs, as well as its aesthetic features) and the world of reference with which the series dialogues. At these trends’ intersection in problematizing journalism and its fictional and visual representations, this article analyzes the types of journalists and journalisms built up and rearranged within the Chilean series Bala Loca based on its communicability strategy. On one hand, its closeness and/or distance with the world it refers to; that is, Chile during the post-dictatorship from 1990 to now and how it is understood. On the other hand, it refers to the type of narrative and audiovisual resources through which these strategies are constructed. Therefore, journalism appears as heterogeneous in Bala Loca. Nonetheless, it has a strong historical referentiality, incarnates the market orientation of the profession inherited from the dictatorship (1973-1990) and illustrates the lack of public service of contemporary journalism in Chile, both in a symbolic and a material sense."

Drawing upon literature about mediated representations of women in politics, gendered digital violence, and intersectionality, this study explores how Twitter users portray indigenous women leaders who were elected as representatives for Chile’s Constitutional Convention. We use a mixed-methods approach based on a manual content analysis of tweets (N = 6,000), aimed at comparing the main attributes associated to indigenous and non-indigenous women Convention representatives in users’ tweets, as well as the valence of these tweets and the engagement of Twitter users, in two time points–the inaugural and the closing days of the Convention. This is complemented with a qualitative thematic analysis focused on tweets directed toward Mapuche women (N = 3,352). Our findings show that indigenous and non-indigenous women’s capacities were discussed by Twitter users, and although both groups experienced online hostility while serving for the Convention, indigenous leaders received negative messages notoriously based on their ethnic background: tweets were mostly positive at the beginning of the process, but became more negative by the end, suggesting a narrative arc that went from an ephemeral moment of symbolic reparation to the restoration of prejudices and stereotypes."

Drawn from an analysis of 17 long-form stories aired by the two main television shows on current affairs in the country, we show that in-depth reporting on Chilean television was chronicling some of the most acute environmental issues since 1990s. Indeed, almost 13 hours of footage assembly a visual memory of conflicts in a society fueled by an extractivist based economy. It is noticeable a geographic diversity when covering the environment, as well as when covering waste production and pollution. Despite a relative diversity in sources, there is a sharp unbalance on gender representation. This article addresses the much-needed research on environment and communication while most of these studies pay attention to industrialized nations. It also contributes to building a situated knowledge considering the specificities of in-depth journalism in South America."

EL CASO DE LA SERIE RAMONA | KEYWORDS: authorship; Chile; fiction; history; Series | ABSTRACT: Relying on a qualitative methodology combining narrative and visual analysis, this article discusses the Chilean television series Ramona (Wood Producciones, 2017-2018). Collecting data through a reception diary, a close viewing of the twelve episodes of the show, and highlighting key features of its conditions of production, we argue that Ramona contributes to better understand Wood's work and characterize its authorship (regarding issues, aesthetics, and narrative). Wood's authorship has been studied by analyzing his films but not his television's productions. The analysis also demonstrates that Ramona inserts History (and it is embedded on it) through its visual grammar and by using references operating as nostalgic clues. Within such paths of reading, Ramona contributes to build up Chilean memory and identity and to better comprehend nostalgia's role in contemporary television fiction. Finally, despite its very local remarks, Ramona also evokes larger processes common to Latin American's contemporary history, such as rural-to-urban migration, the lack of housing, the urban poverty, the emergence of masses (sujeto popular), and grassroots political movements."

The Parliament took three years in discussing the reform and the media (re)produced a debate feed by feminist and human rights organizations, pro-life and pro-choice activists, and political players, and congressmen and presidential representatives. This article thematically analyzes the photographs published in ten Chilean online outlets throughout a year. We organized the images into categories in attempt to understand the role that photographs have in influencing public opinion, constituting ideal audiences. Relying upon the material analyzed, we concluded that the images are not neutral, but create truthfulness, and contribute to establishing a social memory that reinforces patriarchal order, which is hegemonic in the national imaginary."

The field in Chile seems to be expanding, with stable funding, stronger institutionalization, and an increase in better trained researchers. However, this development shows many paradoxes: Despite the valuable insights recent studies in communication have provided to better understand the Chilean communication landscape, they are, rather, applied research, testing global or international theoretical frames to local problems in communication. I argue that the institutional, political, and economic constraints have strongly shaped the possibilities of expanding contemporary communication research in Chile, particularly regarding its theoretical contributions. Therefore, current Chilean communication research seems a work-in-progress project, far from its substantial contributions to the international field in the 1960s and 1970s."

Considering the process of mediatization of politics, it is concluded that these journalistic texts are aimed at people who are already part of the political world, as such a kind of ""political manual"" is emerging, which teaches, cautions and shapes these people. In addition, the photographs constitute the configurating anchors of sense to provide complementary information to the traditional journalistic level, but also in key reading, emphasizing the focus of the note to simplify it to a metaphorical or metonymical level. In short, politics is treated as a subject geared towards specialists and has an exclusive character."

We also assessed the degree to which these indexes are appropriate for measuring media freedom in democratic countries. We concluded that these instruments-with their focus on violence against journalists and government constraints on media-are more appropriate for assessments in nondemocratic countries than for understanding the subtle problems of democracies, often related to the media ownership structure, media's dependence on advertising, self-censorship, and the scant presence of citizen voices. The instruments examined reduce freedom of expression to its negative dimension, freedom from government interference, and ignore positive freedom that is the universal right to free speech."

The study also analyzes differences between the quality press and the popular press, as well as between different news topics, providing empirical evidence about the ways in which media orientation and journalistic beats can shape journalistic performance. Our results indicate that, overall, the disseminator role is the most commonly used in Chilean news, followed by the entertainment and civic roles. The watchdog, service, and especially the loyal-facilitator roles were, in turn, almost absent. The data also show ""that the presence of the analyzed dimensions of professional roles in news content depends on both the media orientation and the journalistic beat. While the infotainment and disseminator roles are more influenced by the orientation of the media-elite versus popular-the watchdog, service, civic and loyal-facilitator roles are more influenced by the main topic of the story."

The figures show the salaries of Chilean journalists are low in relation to other media professionals and compared to other professions. Pay satisfaction levels also are quite low. Nevertheless, the results indicate that salary is one of the two aspects journalists give more importance to in their work. The study also demonstrates that professional experience, level of hierarchy, region, job satisfaction, working hours, the type of journalistic medium and having multiple jobs are the factors that have the greatest influence on the salary of Chilean journalists."

By examining the political, economic, social, cultural and technological factors that have defined the development of journalism in Latin American countries, and specifically in Chile, we propose both widening and redefining the aspects that have to be considered in order to analyze media systems in a comparative fashion, including the reality of new democracies. © 2013 Communication&Society/Comunicación y Sociedad."

Two competing conceptual explanations are tested: the dominance of political structures, levels of press freedom and the size and concentration of media ownership vs the predominance of political cultures and political parallelism. Although the study provides some evidence in favour of the second scenario - overall in terms of the institutional roles supported by the journalists - neither of the two explanations can fully account for the differences between the countries. Meanwhile, the epistemological and ethical views of the journalists seem to be trapped in contesting terrains of ambiguity, where organizational, media routines and individual factors override country differences. © The Author(s) 2012."

The objective of the study was to analyze the development of the self-efficiency of teacher candidates during their education. We hypothesized that the sense of efficiency reported would become stronger as candidates increased their exposure and participation in field-based experiences throughout the program. The results show a fluctuation of the self-efficiency among the training semesters, with a dissimilar behavior of the different factors of the efficiency evaluated. Explanations might be given about the results, opening the door for future interventions aiming at strengthening the sense of efficiency of the teacher trainees."

It discusses how organizational behavior was missing from early retention theory and what changes have occurred since early retention theories and calls for attention to organization behavior concerns were raised. The chapter includes recent literature about the effects of organizational behavior framings on practices that have been linked to student persistence utilizing Berger’s summary of five organizational frames and their relationship to undergraduate student persistence within higher education. It summarizes existing multidimensional organizational frameworks that can be adopted to promote student success. Collegial organizational behaviors influence students’ intentions to persist by promoting a caring culture within the university.

IMAGEN E INSTITUCIONALIDAD DE LA CIENCIA. LA ICONOGRAFÍA POLÍTICA DE LA COMISIÓN NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIÓN CIENTÍFICA Y TECNOLÓGICA (CONICYT), 1967-2018 | KEYWORDS: Conicyt; history; image; political iconography; science; technology | ABSTRACT: For 51 years, the National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (Conicyt) designed policies and instruments to finance and promote scientific research in Chile (1967-2018). This work was the central axis for the development of the political understanding of the production of scientific knowledge in the country. This article presents a historical and panoramic interpretation of this institutional understanding and its respective sociocultural valuation of scientific knowledge production in Chile. For this purpose, we propose an iconological analysis of the six main corporate images of Conicyt, used to symbolize the identity and organizational mission of the institution. We focus the attention on the scientific motifs that compose these images and base our interpretation on the historical analysis of institutional documents, official publications, interviews, and debates on science policy in Latin America. In particular, we argue that each image articulates a political iconography that contains the main expectations and understandings of this institution regarding knowledge production in Chile. Furthermore, we show that these iconographies correlate with the central political changes between the different governments that succeeded each other in the country. Finally, we argue that these political iconographies allow us to distinguish two types of institutional understanding of scientific knowledge, which have remained in tension throughout the history of this public institution."

From an ethnographic approach, we analyze an experimental design in the cognitive neuroscience of perception to describe how standard epistemological criteria for knowledge production take place in concrete scientific spaces and practices. We explain in detail that scientific creativity emerges from a liminal space of epistemic forces that is enabled by heterogeneous social conditions and disciplinary expectations of the scientific community. Finally, by describing this case study we advocate for a more ecological and situated notion of scientific creativity to understand knowledge production processes and practices in the Global South."

Working conditions have become more precarious and the pressure for competition and productivity has intensified, according to research. The purpose of this article is to understand precariousness as an organizing axis of the academic work experience and its relationship with labor subjectivity. Based on the discursive analysis of 60 interviews with male and female academics in different working conditions, we describe academic staff dispositions concerning the uncertainty and instability of work in higher education. The main findings of this work point out that precariousness grids uncomfortable complicities with academic culture central aspects, such as vocation, meritocracy and excellence. At the same time, the analysis shows subjective dispositions and informal collective practices to manage uncertainty and generate stability in work teams. Through this work, we hope to contribute to understand the way higher education policies have transformed university, as well as the effects on the labor subjectivity of academics."

The chapter critically address the construction of the new 'others' in public schools with high enrollment of children of migrant backgrounds in Santiago de Chile. The chapter delves into institutionalized school practices that respond to the ideology of control, to regulate, discipline, and normalize children. The chapter proposes the concept of school practices of pluriverse senses-thoughts in order to speak to the ecology of knowledge (coexistence of diverse knowledge and cosmovisions, ancestral traditions, beliefs, aesthetics, etc.), to resist traditional monoculture in schools and promote a paradigm shift in school education in the 21st century, in Chile and Latin America more broadly."

While the developments of international human rights law have long presupposed the state as its architect, object, and the very condition for its operationalization, nowadays there have been decisive steps towards extending the purview of international human rights beyond the state by institutionalizing them as a normative baseline for the operation of a wide range of global governance regimes. This raises a crucial question: what happens to human rights when they are extracted from their constitutive presumptions? This introductory chapter dwells on this question and tension to elaborate an overall framing for the present volume. Drawing upon the century-old jurisprudence by Santi Romano and Maurice Hauriou, the chapter suggests that this crucial question can be productively approached by tracing the modes of relevance that human rights law has gained in diverse global governance contexts—as the several contributions to this volume illustrate. This century-old jurisprudence nonetheless also entails a theory of crisis. Their insights can largely explain the legitimation crisis that international human rights law is currently experiencing and what is required to overcome it."

What is the place and role of human rights law within these orderings? The present volume moves beyond merely apologetic and sceptical views of human rights in global governance, by showing that the answer to this question is inevitably varied and nuanced. It does so through a set of in-depth studies of several global governance regimes based on diverse theoretical and methodological approaches, including historiography, institutionalism, actor–network theory, political economy, and doctrinal analysis. The volume thus serves as a contemporary reflection and set of arguments on how to study and productively think about human rights in complex governance settings that conveys a refreshing contribution to human rights theory, the law of global governance, and transnational legal studies."

This edited collection connects to this debate. Yet, it shifts the focus from the currently predominant public law focus to investigating European and EU private law and to connecting to literature and research on transnational law. To that end, it proceeds first conceptually by introducing and giving shape to the notion of a “European Transnational Private Law” through four conceptual contributions by the editors. Secondly, it focuses on several sectors (finance, taxation, investment, consumer law, labour law) and topics (climate litigation, global value chains, non-discrimination) to trace sector-specifically the role of EU private law in relation to transnational legal ordering."

2607,-1,"TITLE: The Private Administrative Law of Technical Standardization | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The nature and place of technical standards has remained an enigma for EU law and legal thought, despite their ubiquitous part and growing importance in market-building processes within and beyond Europe. The significance and intractability of this enigma has been heightened by the landmark Fra.bo (2012) and James Elliot (2016) judgments of the ECJ. These judgments have prompted contradictory positions regarding the publicity and justiciability of technical standards among European legal scholarship and even between the European Commission and the European Parliament. The enigma and these contradictory positions have recently reached the ECJ again through the Stichting Rookpreventie case currently under review by its Grand Chamber. Drawing upon a reconstructive analysis of these and other relevant legal sources concerning technical standardization in Europe, this paper surmounts these seeming contradictions by advancing a new account of these legal developments. Contrary to the mainstream positions nowadays in tension, the article argues that these judgments have reaffirmed the New Approach and the distinctive place of technical standardization organizations in the European legal order while avoiding dysfunctional modes of judicialization. It has done so by acknowledging the techno-political character of technical standards and aptly delineating institutional competences between the government and the judiciary throughout technical standardization processes. To guide future legal thinking and reasoning on these processes, the paper recasts these legal developments through the idea of a 'private administrative law' as signifying the way that EU Law has transformed the nature and place of technical standardization in the internal market and as an eventual means for the global reach of EU law."
2608,-1,"TITLE: After Governance?: The Idea of a Private Administrative Law | KEYWORDS: Administrative Law; Competition Law; Economic Law; Legal Institutionalism; Neo-Classical Legal Thought; Police Powers; Private Ordering; Private Regulation | ABSTRACT: A panoptic overview of current governing practices evidences an expansive role of private regulation in a significant range of crucial public policy issues. Whether at the domestic, regional or global levels, such a phenomenon has increasingly become perceived as a conundrum, if not an overall crisis, for modern paradigms of legal and political authority. Building upon the array of case studies that the phenomenon has already elicited, this paper advances four interrelated arguments. First, descriptively, it contends that the administrative state has experienced a large-scale transformation due to the proliferation of a varied, multifaceted and fast evolving range of private regulatory practices. Second, methodologically, after mapping the way these private regulatory practices have been conceptualised in post-national legal theories, it conveys the importance of moving beyond the state of the art by adopting a phenomenological approach to contemporary legal orderings. Third, drawing upon comparative analysis of competition law, it distinguishes two broad models that have emerged to address the private regulation phenomenon: (i) the private ordering model, predominant in the US; and (ii) the private police powers model, predominant in the EU, which, I claim, could be productively understood from a doctrinal perspective as an emergent private administrative law. Finally, at a normative level, I conclude positioning such a private administrative law model as a distinctive conceptual framework to reflect upon the place, role and the very significance of law within a landscape of contemporary political economies characterised by an expanding topography of private regulators."
2609,-1,"TITLE: Voyaging through standards, contracts, and codes: the transnational quest of European regulatory private law | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Drawing upon the experience of travelling into foreign places as a guiding metaphor, this chapter argues that any analytical venture seeking to map the external effect of a domestic legal field entails a reflective facet that is usually expressed in the very terms and parameters that have been selected to orientate the examination. On this basis, the chapter proceeds in three steps. First, it situates the analytical endeavour of studying the external dimension of European regulatory private law (ED-ERPL) within the context of a perceived legitimation crisis of the EU and its legal order, to query about the overall meaning and significance of this endeavour. By interconnecting the various chapters in this volume with previous instantiations of the ERPL project and broader EU legal scholarship on the topic, second, it sketches the idea of a private administrative law as a conceptual framework that could productively integrate the understanding and assessment about how EU law is shaping the exercise of private regulatory authority through standards, contracts or codes. Finally, to emphasize the reflective facet regardingforthcoming ERPL voyages into foreign regulatory places, the chapter concludes by outlining some immanent analytical, methodological and normative challenges that are already looming on the horizon."

Using mixed qualitative methodologies, this research explores the spatial and non-spatial causes of this injustice, and examines solutions presented by Key Independent Organizations addressing the issue in London. The analysis problematizes how inequitable social conditions may constrain young women’s design preferences, potentially leading to solutions that perpetuate gendered behaviours with detrimental outcomes. This study provides a point of reference for future initiatives addressing the problem and adds to the growing discourse surrounding inequality in public space."

Recognising the key actors and the critical moments within the rescue coordinating organisations is crucial for diagnosis, data collection and deliberation of people’s transfers to safer places. In Chile, decision making around these processes involves mainly three government ministries. The Ministry of Social Development collects information about people and families affected by the emergency; the Ministry of Housing and Urbanism compiles housing data and allocates transitory or definitive housing benefits for the affected families; and the Ministry of the Interior which, through the National Service for Prevention and Response to Disasters (SENAPRED), elaborate plans and coordinates public and private resources to manage the emergency. At the time, other groups join the coordination response: volunteers, fire units, police officers, civil society groups, and insurance companies, among others. The article explores the institutional and technical complexities involved in the first response after earthquakes in Chile (e.g., data collection, systematisation, analysis, and decision making)."

Normalizing medical entities is challenging, especially for languages other than English, where lexical variation is considerably under-represented. Here, we report a new linguistic resource for medical entity normalization in Spanish. We applied a UMLS-based medical lexicon (MedLexSp) to automatically normalize mentions from 2000 medical referrals of the Chilean Waiting List Corpus. Three medical students manually revised the automatic normalization. The inter-coder agreement was computed, and the distribution of concepts, errors, and linguistic sources of variation was analyzed. The automatic method normalized 52% of the mentions, compared to 91% after manual revision. The lowest agreement between automatic and automatic-manual normalization was observed for Finding, Disease, and Procedure entities. Errors in normalization were associated with ortho-typographic, semantic, and grammatical linguistic inadequacies, mainly of the hyponymy/hyperonymy, polysemy/metonymy, and acronym-abbreviation types. This new resource can enrich dictionaries and lexicons with new mentions to improve the functioning of modern entity normalization methods. The linguistic analysis offers insight into the sources of lexical variety in the Spanish clinical environment related to error generation using lexicon-based normalization methods. This article also introduces a workflow that can serve as a benchmark for comparison in studies replicating our analysis in Romance languages."

One of the more important gaps in recreational fishing management is the availability of a methodological framework that would make it possible to identify and assess areas that are suitable for developing this activity. The purpose of this research is to propose a methodology to evaluate areas with the best potential for the development of recreational fishing. The methodology is based on Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis (SMCA) and was applied in the hydrographic basins of the Valdivia River and lake Ranco in the Los Ríos Region in the south of Chile. The application of the SMCA methodology made it possible to select six areas with a high potential for recreational fishing, which share suitable characteristics in terms of their assessed attributes: (a) landscape, (b) water quality, (c) biological yield and (d) navigability, among others. The SMCA methodology made it possible to conduct a comprehensive valuation of the natural resources, assessing not only the optimal conditions for recreational fishing but also environmental aspects such as landscape quality and accessibility, which are highly valued and essential to sustain recreational fishing activities. Thus, it is possible to provide support both to the objectives of economic development regarding recreational fishing and the goals of protecting and managing the natural environment."

This study’s findings inform not only the factors under which collective capabilities had not yet been developed for this NGO, but also the ontological and epistemological grounds on which Mapuche participants built these understandings. These considerations are of central importance for participatory research interventions if the ultimate goal is to promote meaningful and transformative social change among indigenous communities at local levels. This new epistemic production is a promising way forward to promote cross-cultural conversations between the CA and indigenous realities."

One of them was composed of self-organized citizens, NGOs, and Chilean exiles in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). This movement was a response to affected individuals facing the lack of immediate measures and policies of the FRG’s government towards exile and human rights violation victims in Chile. This article offers a cartography that traces key locations of such solidarity network: places where solidarity events took place, where the subjects involved reside, and their transits; with a special but not exclusive focus on the state of Baden-Württemberg, in the federal south. Considering the historical moment when this took place–Cold War scenario: Germany divided between the two ruling blocks–the cartography shows how this movement was a way of subverting that geopolitical order. This work, therefore, is a new contribution to the studies of solidarity and, at the same time, it links those studies with the field of STS, by presenting a cartography as a visual dispositif that documents the imbrications of solidarity, affections, politics, culture, Germans, and Chileans on a given territory."
2616,10,"TITLE: The Right to Access to Justice as a Key to Understand the Right to a Fair Trial in Civil Matters | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: In this chapter it is argued that based on the findings of the research on how due process is applied in practice in non-criminal matters, the right to a access to justice is a basic right which procedural fairness entails. Either a process-based or an outcome-based theory on procedural fairness presuppose access to a court in a meaningful way. Later, it is explained why such an understanding of procedural due process is consistent with the common use of due process as a legal institution in both the international and national jurisdictions studied in the previous chapters. Finally, I analyze the role played by the flexible and the checklist models under this conception based on the right to access to justice."
2617,-1,"TITLE: Why Civil and Criminal Procedures Require Different Theories on Procedural Due Process | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: In this chapter I argue that civil justice needs to escape the shadow of criminal justice. Although due process, both in criminal and non-criminal matters, shares a common theoretical core based on the concept of procedural fairness, they differ in important respects. Based on a model designed between purpose and parties’ relative position of power in the legal procedure, I argue in civil matters procedural fairness not only requires procedural rights in order to ensure accurate determination of fact as proxy for a quality outcome, but also to ensure a legal need has been satisfied, a dispute solved, a right has been protected. Procedural due process, in this regard, and as an inherent element of it, requires also access to the legal procedure and the capacity to maintain it until the end. In this sense, a procedure would also be unfair, no matter how accurate it might be or protective of procedural guarantees, if it is too costly or ineffective to be useful."
2618,7,"TITLE: The Crisis of Civil Justice. Criticism from the Access to Justice Movement and the Reform Movement in Latin America | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: In this chapter, I will provide an account of the idea of the crisis of civil justice in comparative civil procedure literature and from the access to justice movement, claiming the need for a more accessible civil justice. The idea is first to introduce the problem and then to explain why facing this crisis requires a better understanding of the requirements of due process in civil procedure. As I will explain in the second section, this is problematic because providing effective access to justice is a fundamental obligation of the State. Moreover, an effective protection of this right is important to maintain legitimacy of the judicial system, and ultimately, the rule of law. Finally, I focus on the situation of Latin-American and briefly describe the reform efforts urging for a more accessible civil justice in this region."
2619,10,"TITLE: Modern Conceptions of Procedural Due Process and the Right to a Fair Trial in Civil Matters | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter describes a long and winding road on the Supreme Court case law in non-criminal matters, into what might characterize as a modern conception on procedural due process. It begins by describing the context that marked the transformation of the traditional approach followed by the Supreme Court into the current approach in non-criminal matters. In this regard, it focuses on the Due Process revolution as an attempt to broaden the protection of procedural due process and to search for a test to determine what is the procedure that is due once the clause is triggered beyond criminal law. Then, it describes how the case law led to the Mathews v. Eldridge test, the current approach used by the Court, and the debates that have arisen in the last decades regarding, class actions, statistical adjudication and arbitration. It also briefly addresses the right of access to a court and its relationship with the right to a due process. Finally, it explores some possible explanations and provides some future research question regarding the question on why the constitutional doctrine in civil matters has been much more recent and thinner than in criminal law issues."
2620,10,"TITLE: Preliminary Exercise of a Comparative Perspective. Different Approaches on How the Right to a Fair Trial Has Been Applied to Common Legal Needs | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Based on the existing research on unmet legal needs and an hypothetical case scenario, this chapter compares two jurisdictions to show how different conceptions on the right to a fair trial might have an important impact on the design and functioning of a civil procedure, particularly from the point of view of access to justice. In this regard, the chapter begins by exploring the concept of unmet legal needs and the tradition of studies that have identified some common trends in this regard. Based on the findings of the first section, I have created a hypothetical scenario to compare two jurisdictions, the State of California and Chile. First I provide arguments to justify why this is a workable comparison, and then I analyze both from the point of view of the applicable substantive law, constitutional provisions on due process, and the legal procedure involved."

With this purpose, I use an empirical mixed method approach to study its case law over a sample of 303 cases identified using the HUDOC search engine of the ECHR. I have analyzed this case law using to set of variables. One group of variables applied to capture basic data to better describe the case, and other to identify and operationalize the ideal model described in Chap. 1. Finally, this chapter describes what I have called a concrete analysis of effectiveness as the main approach used by the ECHR to decide over the right to a fair trial in civil cases."
2622,-1,"TITLE: Origins of the Due Process Clause. The Magna Carta Until Its Incorporation in the American Bill of Rights | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter explores the historical origins of procedural due process. A study of the origins of this provision in the Magna Carta until its introduction into modern constitutions and other legal instruments will facilitate an understanding of what fair trial requires in non-criminal matters in general, and in civil proceedings in particular. Although I will narrow the scope of my research to non-criminal matters, part will refer to due process and its criminal justice origins. That is inevitable given that from the beginning the due process clause was an essential tool against the abuse of criminal prosecution and for that reason, most of its development was centered on guarantees for the accused. However, as I will explain, the implications for civil justice were there from the beginning. My intention is to show how it evolved in time until modern conceptions."
2623,10,"TITLE: A Brief Comparison Between Both Regional Systems | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter is not intended to provide a purely comparative analysis but to describe how the right to fair trial in non-criminal matters is understood in each regional system. Nevertheless, I think there are important findings to highlight by looking at both systems. The main finding is that there are differences in how each international tribunal conceives the requirements of due process over civil or non-criminal matters. By reading only the text of both clauses, article 8.1 of the American Convention and 6.1 of the European Convention, they might seem superfluous and slight differences. However, by studying how the case law had interpreted and applied them to different dimensions of the right to a fair trial and to specific procedural elements in each international tribunal, it is possible to identify results that differ and have important consequences. In fact, these differences, reflect different positions on the continuum created by applying my two models approach. In the first section I describe some of the similarities and differences I have found between both regional systems. In the following section, I provide some preliminary thoughts or explanations for these differences. In this regard, I will not try to identify causal relationships between these factors and my findings but to suggest some future research paths."
2624,10,"TITLE: Due Process as a Subject of Special Jurisprudence. The Checklist and Flexible Models of Procedural Due Process | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The answer to the question of which procedure is provided by the right to due process may have a critical impact on how accessible the civil justice is. With this purpose, in this chapter, first I describe procedural due process as a complex jurisprudential concept and, second, I introduce the analytical framework I will use in what follows with the purpose of studying how procedural due process it is conceived in different jurisdictions: the checklist model and the flexible model. Using an ideal type approach to explain different conceptions of the right to a fair trial from a practical perspective, it will prove to be useful to move to an analysis with normative character on how to reconcile the requirements of procedural fairness with social demands for justice, as expressed by the access to justice movement."

With this purpose, I use an empirical mixed method approach to study the case law of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR). I do so by analyzing the 19 cases of the IACHR dealing with legal issues fitting my operational definition of civil matters, from 299 decisions on the merits as of August 2019, and complementing the former with Advisory Opinions of the court and the thematic reports of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, to support the study of the court’s case law."

With this purpose, I analyze the answers provided by two regional systems of human rights protection, using an empirical mixed method approach to study the case law of their two main tribunals, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). This chapter focus on the methodology used to study their case law, beginning by describing an operational definition to distinguish civil cases from those criminal or punitive in nature. Then I describe the variables I applied over a databased comprising the 19 cases I was able to find from the IACHR and 303 decisions from the ECHR."
2627,-1,"TITLE: Introduction | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The right to a due process of law is a complex concept for jurisprudence theory. History, tradition, normative provisions, reality, philosophical roots, and mandated authorities, to name a few variables, makes this institution a complex one. As an underlying assumption of this book, during the design of legal proceedings, decision-makers are mandated to establish and provide safeguards for the requirements of fairness. Such requirements, as a normative demand on how the State must treat individuals, are expressed not just in the procedural guarantees afforded to them, but also in the question of the access they should have. This is the key idea that is intended to be further developed in this book. How to understand due process and its requirements in civil matters has a critical impact on the design of a civil procedure to provide access to civil justice."
2628,-1,"TITLE: The Path of Procedural Due Process into the American Constitution. Scope of Application | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The historical development of the due process clause and the political context by which it was incorporated in earlier American documents and further declarations and constitutions explains the general focus on criminal matters. This focus on criminal matters might explain why even early commentators saw the clause as limited to this field of law. However, as explained in this chapter, there is a connection between the due process clause in the American Constitution and civil procedure. Two approaches are provided in order to support to this argument. First, the debates over the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment, and the Seventh Amendment on civil jury trial. Second, I describe the period from the early case law of the Supreme Court until the “Due Process Revolution”. I will show how procedural due process were forged in the American Constitution while proving that at its origins it included non-criminal as well as criminal conceptions."

Furthermore, it outlines the main explanatory models of historical linguistic change (grammaticalization, construc-tionalization, lexicalization, pragmatization, and discursive traditions) and shows how they can be applied to the study of lexical units and patrimonial structures of the Chilean variety. Lastly, it reflects about the possibility that the historical study of chilenismos results in a proposal for a Historical Dictionary of Chilean Spanish."
2630,-1,"TITLE: Territorial Fantasies, Sexual Nuances, and Savage Energy: Orientalism and Tropicality in Eugène Delacroix and Johann Moritz Rugendas | KEYWORDS: Delacroix; Orientalism; Romanticism; Rugendas; South America; Tropicality | ABSTRACT: In 1822, the German Romantic painter Johann Moritz Rugendas undertook his famed three-year journey across Brazil. Later, between 1831 and 1846, encouraged by Alexander von Humboldt and other Romantic artists, he would make a second trip through Mexico and South America. In 1832, Eugène Delacroix started a six-month journey to Spain and North Africa as a part of a diplomatic mission. Both artists profusely translated their travels into words and rich images of tropical America and the Orient. Their paintings and illustrations of remote lands and people became milestones in their respective careers while being prime examples of how Europe viewed and perceived the rest of the world in the nineteenth century. In hindsight, they were not only mere agents and promoters of two crucial aesthetic trends of that time: Orientalism and Tropicality but the embodiment of two ways of seeing and imagining the Others. This article places these two artists against each other, contrasting the set of ideas and cultural preconceptions resting behind a sizeable number of paintings, drawings, and illustrations of their Eastern and South American experiences. The central argument is that Tropicality and Orientalism were comparable phenomena based on similar tropes and assumptions. It brings forward recurring themes of Rugendas and Delacroix’s works, such as the eroticisation of female bodies and the linkage between South America and the East with everlasting ideas of violence, adventures, and savageness to prove such an equivalence."

Nevertheless, accessing quality education involves navigating a lengthy journey and making decisions that become more challenging when choosing between inclusive or special education. The objective of this article was to explore the challenges and supports identified by caregivers of students with disabilities or special educational needs, as well as what adaptations they and their environments have had to incorporate for the full development of the children under their care. By employing a qualitative methodology, we conducted eleven semi-structured interviews and three ethnographic observations. The results emphasize the proactive role of caregivers in assuming administrative functions within the school community. However, the most notable aspect was their capacity for adaptation and reconceptualization regarding disability and normality, sometimes conflicting with those in their family environments and their own beliefs. This provides evidence of an innovative adaptation involving the reshaping of expectations and conceptualizations that impact educational trajectories."
2632,0,"TITLE: Graphogame intervention as a tool for early diagnosis of reading difficulties in Spanish-speaking children with developmental language disorder | KEYWORDS: developmental language disorder; early diagnosis; GraphoGame; oral comprehension; reading difficulties; reading fluency; reading predictors | ABSTRACT: GraphoGame is a computer-based game that trains grapheme-to-phoneme associations and has been shown to benefit reading acquisition in different languages and countries. In transparent languages, such as Spanish, learning grapheme-to-phoneme associations is of great importance when learning to read, and GraphoGame can help children at risk of developing reading difficulties overcome their struggles. Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) are at high risk of developing reading difficulties, and they are therefore an interesting target group for a study on the effects of using GraphoGame as an intervention tool, as well as a tool for early diagnosis of later reading difficulties. Using generalised linear mixed models, this article explores the progress made in GraphoGame and reading-related skills by children with DLD – with and without comprehension difficulties – and their typically developing (TD) classmates in kindergarten or first grade. Fifty-nine children were included in the current study (16 TD and 43 DLD; mean age = 6.4 years, SD = 0.7 years). By testing children before and after six weeks of GraphoGame intervention, changes in their performance at letter recognition, pseudoword recognition and phonological awareness are studied. In addition to the differences due to oral language skills (expressive and receptive), how the children perform in GraphoGame and whether the progress in the aforementioned reading-related skills is predictive of reading status in second grade (good or poor readers) are examined. After six weeks of GraphoGame intervention, all children improved at all of the assessed reading-related skills, regardless of the test (letter recognition, phonological awareness and pseudoword recognition). Additionally, the children with DLD with comprehension difficulties made less progress in GraphoGame than the other two groups. The same was found for the children who were classified as poor readers in second grade: none of the poor readers reached the highest levels of the game. Finally, performance at the first level of GraphoGame mildly correlated with reading fluency, as assessed one year after the intervention. Future studies should consider larger populations, as well as the long-term effect of interventions such as the one studied here."

Inclusive education has been promoted in recent decades as the optimal method of educating in diversity. However, in Chile, access to quality education remains a major challenge for students and their families. In this article, we explore the experiences, motivations, and main factors in making early educational decisions by families and caregivers of children on the autism spectrum. In particular, using six semi-structured interviews conducted with families and caregivers of children, we study the process of initial entry into the educational system, including parents’ perceptions and knowledge of the access routes to it and the facilitators and barriers present for their incorporation. The results indicate that, from the very beginning, the information available social and family attitudes, may hinder children’s access to the available care and education system, with a generalized demand to strengthen social and institutional support networks. In general, and as may be expected, educational decisions, trajectories, and expectations are interdependent and evolve with the experience of caregivers and children in the educational system and their families."
2634,0,"TITLE: The paradoxes of inclusion: cognitive and socio-emotional developmental trajectories of deaf and blind primary education students in mainstream and special schools | KEYWORDS: cognitive development; inclusion; inclusive education; sensory impairment; socio-emotional development | ABSTRACT: Introduction: Students with special educational needs (SEN) have historically found participating in the regular education system challenging. Since the 1990s, inclusion has been considered the optimal strategy for their development. However, the effects of inclusive education on deaf and blind students are still little studied. Methods: In the present article, we report the results of a longitudinal study on the cognitive and socioemotional developmental trajectories of 23 deaf and 29 blind primary education students attending mainstream (8 deaf and 10 blind) and special schools (15 deaf and 19 blind). The study was conducted in Santiago de Chile between 2018 and 2019. Results: Our descriptive results suggest that deaf students attending special schools perform better on most of the variables studied. For blind students, those attending traditional schools generally perform better than those attending special schools. However, in the case of socio-emotional variables, blind students attending special schools tend to show fewer problems. However, almost all of the indicated differences are not statistically significantly different. Discussion: We then discuss the need to consider the characteristics of each group of students with SEN when defining an adequate educational system for their optimal development."
2635,0,"TITLE: Social education for global justice Éducation sociale pour une justice globale Educação social para a justiça global Educación Social para la Justicia Global | KEYWORDS: Capitalism; Global Competence; Global Justice; Human rights; study case | ABSTRACT: Global Justice Education is an educational approach that seeks to develop a critical understanding of global issues such as poverty, North-South inequalities, or the climate crisis, and to foster active citizenship participa-tion in the search for solutions to these problems. It is a theoretical/practical proposal that has gained relevance in higher education, as it promotes the development of global competence and fosters the development of skills such as reflection, empathy, conflict resolution, and awareness of the global interdependence of human beings. Although social education and global justice education share objectives, there are few experiences that integrate this approach into the training of future social educators. This article systematically reviews a subject in the Social Education degree program at the University of Barcelona that introduces the Global Justice Education approach. To this end, a case study was conducted on the subject and the reflective and practical work of the students, analyzing 99 didactic units carried out during the period 2016-2022. The conclusions indicate that students achieve a creative and contextual-ized appropriation of the objectives of Global Justice Education, while the approach presents a great transformative and emancipatory potential for the practice of Social Education."

Caceres’s speeches as leader of the Honduran Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organisations (COPINH) between 2009 and 2016 are analysed through the lens of three key topics: Agency; Resistance strategies; Grassroots-indigenous Feminism. The methodology used in this paper builds on Sociological Discourse Analysis (SDA) and highlights the structure of discourse based on categories such as the context of production and its interpretation as a social practice. The study’s findings lead to the idea that Caceres’ discursive position embodies the junction between indigenous resistance and Feminist agencies, which is to say the grassroots defence of land and body as a response to the capital-life crisis and the commodification of common goods. The paper also questions Neo-Liberalism’s hegemonic narrative as it showcases subjective proposals forming part of resistance to colonial capitalist power. These subjectivities are expressed in practices based on ‘commons’, care, reciprocity, community life linked to nature, and the priority given to life’s reproductive cycle."

However, the theoretical foundations of EpJG are under construction and weakly articulated with practice. Therefore, this paper develops a conceptual framework of education and global justice and presents a documentary analysis of the main reflective material arising from the practices and experiences of the entities. In this context, a proposal for emancipatory education is observed that aims to provide insight into global ecology and interdependence, analyze the factors and causes responsible for inequalities in the world, and support critical educational innovation and the balance of knowledge. However, the proposal has certain limitations and requires addressing emerging issues to continue moving forward in these processes of change."

In this context, the implementation of distance education has had multiple consequences for teachers (Villalobos Muñoz, 2021) and, particularly for women, who must make their teaching function coexist with domestic and care work, complicating the already difficult reconciliation of work and family. On this basis, the aim of the article is to analyze, this article aims to analyze, from a gender perspective, the precarious situation experienced by early childhood and primary education teachers in Chile and, in addition, to know how this situation has worsened in the context of the pandemic. To achieve this objective, a qualitative study was carried out based on semi-structured interviews with nine early childhood and primary education teachers from the Province of Valparaíso. The main results indicate that the already precarious working condition has been aggravated by the lack of material, technical and procedural resources with which they face online teaching. On the other hand, the blurring of borders between the paid world of work and care, as part of the consequences of teleworking, has generated a physical and emotional overload for teachers. Finally, they realize that the management of educational authorities and schools during the pandemic is seen by those interviewed as inconsistent with reality, both by Chilean teachers and students."
2640,14,"TITLE: Mining, development and unequal regionalization in subnational Latin American contexts | KEYWORDS: Development; Environment; Inequality; Mining; Region | ABSTRACT: Territorial planning based on the use of nature is a problem that needs to be addressed in Latin America since it reaffirms the extraction and export of minerals as a development strategy and exacerbates economic dependence on natural resources. The objective of this research is to study mining on an intranational and interregional scale from a territorial and environmental approach to evaluate the relevance of functional regionalization plans that seek to reduce inequality and protect the environment. The mining sector's productive indicators and other social, demographic and environmental indicators were analyzed using official data for the period 2010–2020. The application of territorial planning instruments - such as functional regionalization - promotes the creation of corporate territories that benefit mining companies to the detriment of the population and the territories they inhabit. Uneven development prevails on an inter-regional scale, leaving some regions excluded, impoverished and environmentally depredated. More comprehensive policies are needed to face the processes of territorial inequality and the subsequent reconfiguration of power, so the inhabitants of the territories can make effective decisions on how to lead a dignified life while prioritizing the productive activities that contribute to this objective."

It proposes that, by approaching digital artworks from the politics of the commons, it is possible to recognize a series of subversive practices that involve diverse agencies, cosmotechniques and values of use to the global north, in the context of a digital world increasingly normativized by surveillance capitalism, neo-extractivism and the primacy of exchange value. Through the analysis of diverse works gathered in archives of Latin American digital literature, I seek to recognize the patterns related to common practices, in order to understand what differences and contributions these works propose as Latin American situated works, especially with respect to the displays of reappropriation of common goods contained in language, disputing conceptions of alternative times to capital through collaborative exercises of production, promotion of use value over exchange value or denaturalization of languages of dispossession along with their contradictions and historical modern violence."

It does this through three axes: the first is multidisciplinary, including historical, anthropological, sociological, and pedagogical, to account for varied aspects of the Chilean intercultural education. The second is the consideration of multiple indigenous peoples, analyzing students’ groups or indigenous peoples, such as the Rapa Nui, Aymara, or Mapuche. Finally, the book has a multilevel perspective that recognizes that educational policy involves different actors, from the central government to local communities. The book incorporates study material enriched with the experience and analysis of different perspectives and methodologies of its authors, being useful for understanding intercultural education in the country. It is a versatile resource for understanding this topic, as well as a support for the development of programs and policies."

With the marketization of schools in the US and abroad, teachers’ professional identities are changing. However, we know little about how teachers negotiate—and renegotiate—their professional identities during the job search in contexts with school choice, such as charter schools. This study uses qualitative interview data from 46 teachers in San Antonio, Texas, where over 25% of students attend charter schools. Our findings illuminate the job search as a critical juncture where teachers evaluate their professional identity as they make choices about the sector —charter or traditional public school—and/or school organization they prefer. In particular, the choice context legitimated flexibility and fluidity in teachers’ professional identity as teachers moved between sectors to find jobs, even if the school did not align with their personal or professional values. We also found that employability and teachers’ perception of the j ob market played an important role in how teachers strategically presented their professional identity on the job search. Findings offer implications for teacher education and teacher workforce policies."

An approach from the paradigm of scheduling under explorable uncertainty | KEYWORDS: optimization; scheduling; standarized test; Test-taking strategies | ABSTRACT: In this article, we adopt the paradigm of scheduling under explorable uncertainty to explore test-taking strategies to solve standardized tests in terms of maximizing the correct questions answered. From this approach, a test taker considers a number of questions and has the possibility to read in order to obtain the difficulty of the question. Later, he/she has the option, for example, to answer the question or to skip the one that seemed difficult and read the next question in the test. Specifically, we state the problem definition by considering two test-taking strategies, formulate and implement a mathematical model, and generate computational experiments in order to determine the dominance of one strategy over another. The results show that the dominance depends directly on the design of the test and the maximum time to perform it, so knowing these parameters allow us to provide algorithmic insights to address this problem."

In the process, this estimation must be computed in the middle of the year, and therefore, the reduction of the impact of error in the estimation face to uncertainty is a desirable goal. In this work, we propose an easy-to-implemented robust estimation method, which is based on the formulation, implementation, and integration of a set of mathematical models that target the minimization of the maximum estimation error. The obtained results show that the proposal obtains a better estimation than the current MINEDUC estimation model, providing an efficient alternative of robust estimation method for the decision makers in the process, exposing insights to be considered in the future."

In the last months of 2019, a popular anti-neoliberal revolt was marked by social protests, violent and nonviolent civil disobedience and political upheaval. Feminists, specifically from the collective Coordinadora Feminista 8 de Marzo (C8M), became central during this period. They not only participated in the organisation of protests and artistic interventions but also helped to install and advance feminist ideas in mainstream public debate. Based on qualitative interviews with feminist activists, conducted between February and April 2021, this article identifies three strands of feminist political ideas that were predominant during and after the popular revolt: 1) autonomism as anti-neoliberal organising; 2) the resurgence of the idea of political-sexual violence; and 3) the link between neoliberalism and the precariousness of life. Following these three strands, this article argues that what occurred in Chile was a feminist revolt, understood as the potencia to transit from concept-building to demand-making in order to push forward feminist horizons as a central political idea."

2651,5,"TITLE: My Home Quarantine on an App: A Qualitative Visual Analysis of Changes in Family Routines During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Chile | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; Everyday Life; Mobile Application; Multimodal Methods; Visual Analysis | ABSTRACT: This article presents original findings from a longitudinal qualitative study on changes in individual and family life associated with safety and health measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in three regions of Chile. We developed a methodological approach based on multimodal diaries in a mobile application, in which participants submitted photographs and texts to express changes in their daily lives under residential confinement. Content and semiotic visual analyses show a significant loss in instances of collective recreation, partially compensated through new personal and productive activities performed at home. Our results suggest that modal diaries serve as potential tools to capture people’s perceptions and meanings as their lives go through exceptional and traumatic times. We assert that using digital and mobile technologies in qualitative studies could allow subjects to actively participate in the co-construction of fieldwork and produce quality knowledge from their situated perspectives."

Based on a review of statistics, reports and specialized literature, various factors that contribute to the increase in irregular migration are identified, such as regional instability, Venezuelan displacement and its context of forced mobility. This paper focuses on three policies implemented in Chile: the restriction to change status within the country, the modifications to the visa system and the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The central hypothesis is that the measures adopted have not reduced irregularity, but rather have increased denunciations of entry through unauthorized passages, contributing to the precariousness of migrants and hindering their inclusion in Chilean society. Methodology: The methodology of the article is based on a qualitative documentary analysis, which systematically examines relevant documents to identify factors influencing the increase of irregular migration in Chile, using an analytical-synthetic approach to obtain a deep and broad understanding of the situation. Results: The study concludes that migration in Chile post-2018 faces challenges derived from regional and international factors, especially the Venezuelan diaspora. Chilean migration policies, including status restrictions and visa modifications, have increased the irregularity and vulnerability of migrants. In addition, the lack of comprehensive statistics on irregular migration is highlighted, which prevents a better understanding of migration dynamics, which subsequently has an impact on the precariousness of journeys."

This situation has intensified amid increasing regional forced mobility due to various barriers to accessing the asylum application process and requirements imposed by regulatory changes aligned with migration governance policies. By employing the notion of a humanitarian frontier, the study examines processes of selectivity and differentiation marked by affiliation with certain nationalities. Methodology: A mixed qualitative analysis was conducted, including statistical review, document analysis, and examination of management practices related to forced displacement. The study explores two cases that illustrate how the state has restricted the recognition of asylum. Conclusions: The findings reveal that Chile employs selective state management differentiated by nationality, prioritizing the protection of certain migrant groups that align with the classical definition of a refugee. This approach is linked to the non-recognition of other diasporas experiencing forced mobility. Originality: This paper examines the state of asylum in Chile by connecting it to the concept of a humanitarian frontier, aiming to reveal how state protection intertwines with the control of mobility."
2654,-1,"TITLE: Expedited removal of foreign persons in Chile: An analysis of its application Reconducción de personas extranjeras en Chile: Análisis de su aplicación | KEYWORDS: expedited removal; expulsion; Human mobility; irregularity; migration | ABSTRACT: Expedited removal is a legal figure in force in Chile since 2022, enabling the immediate return of foreigners caught entering the country by circumventing immigration controls or under an enforceable order of expulsion, abandonment, or entry ban. This article, based on statistical analysis, shows that by January 2024, over ten thousand removals had been executed, mostly involving Bolivian nationals, with a focus on certain nationalities predominantly in the northern region of the country. A high rate of refusal by Bolivia is also observed, particularly in cases involving Venezuelan nationals, who account for the most reports of unauthorized border crossings. Consequently, it is concluded that this measure fails to prevent irregular entries and, instead, exacerbates the precariousness of migratory journeys."

This figure involves the immediate return of individuals caught trying to enter Chile by evading immigration control or using false or adulterated documents or documents issued in the name of another person. The reconduction poses procedural risks, and the lack of in-depth studies on this figure highlights its novelty. It is concluded that reconduction without prior jurisdictional intervention could compromise Inter-American human rights standards, especially regarding essential procedural guarantees such as access to justice and due process."

Twelve medical professionals were interviewed. After qualitative thematic analysis, the categories ""Attachment in tension"" and ""The other, the black, and the bad"" emerged. The medical discourse emphasizes questioning individuals carrying blackness, based on a racial fiction towards Haitian women.

It is argued that these measures result from a migration policy that combines securitization, economization, and false humanitarianism, with negative migrant selectivity at its core, evidenced in juridical-administrative practices and irregular entries of Venezuelan and Haitian citizens. Through three fundamental critiques— decisions not based on evidence, exceptional legal treatment, and governmental incapacity to coordinate a multilateral response—this work contends that the increase in irregularity since 2018 is not solely attributable to the Venezuelan crisis itself but also to the State’s response to displacement over the past decade."

Based on a qualitative methodology of documentary analysis of specialized literature, statistical material and reports, it is observed that, despite the increase in forced displacements, the Chilean State has granted refuge to a small number of child and adolescent applicants, most of whom have not been granted a response, which is particularly worrying considering the serious crisis affecting Venezuela. It is evident that the scenario has worsened, since in recent years there has been a substantial increase in the entry of children and adolescents through unauthorized crossings, particularly Venezuelan nationals. In view of this situation, the main responses generated by the Chilean legal system are analyzed, as well as the correspondence of the measures adopted with respect to international standards on the migration of children and adolescents. It is concluded that, although there are efforts by the Chilean State to provide protection to children and adolescents in the context of forced mobility, they are insufficient in light of the principle of the best interests of the child."

These measures have been accompanied by a commitment to the militarization of the northern border and the mediatization of expulsions, along with a rhetoric that dichotomizes displacements into positive/negative, according to their administrative situation, thus conditioning the rights of migrants. This paper examines, from the paradigm of migration governance and through a documentary analysis, the Chilean migration policy from 2018 to 2022, investigating from a qualitative and exploratory approach the main measures implemented and the rhetoric used. It is concluded that in this presidential period a policy has been intensified that, through a human rights narrative, restricts certain flows, increasing irregularity and the precariousness of the crossings, consequences that contradict the premise of “orderly, safe and regular migration” on which the government administration is based. This dynamic has been strongly expressed in the Tarapacá Region, a territory that has become the epicenter of the migratory situation."

This study estimates the differential effect of the pandemic on girls' and boys' mathematics achievement progress from Grades 6–10 in Chile, where extended school closures took place. To this end, we analyzed data from a national standardized test (N = 415,046 students) using multilevel models. The gender gap in mathematics achievement gains increased significantly to the detriment of girls during the pandemic. The widening of the gap was larger in high-SES schools. These findings underscore the gendered nuances of socioeconomic advantage within the Chilean school system."
2661,5,"TITLE: Inequalities in learning loss during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile: the significance of school effectiveness | KEYWORDS: Covid-19 pandemic; Global South; inequalities; Learning losses; school effectiveness | ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic-associated learning losses were unequal across school subjects and sociodemographic groups. This study posits that these losses are also heterogeneous based on pre-pandemic school effectiveness, that is, the value schools added above the expected students’ learning based on their socioeconomic background. Using national-scale standardized mathematics and reading test scores, we compared learning losses between 2013–2018 (pre-pandemic) and 2022 at the school level in Chile and examined how they varied according to an indicator of schools’ pre-pandemic effectiveness. Schools with high effectiveness underwent the highest pandemic-driven losses, especially in mathematics. These losses were more pronounced as schools reopened later and students’ post-pandemic attendance decreased. Educational policies should adjust to this heterogeneity. While high-vulnerability, high-effectiveness schools require support to mitigate the pandemic’s effects, low-effectiveness schools must enhance their capacity to foster student learning beyond these impacts."

Based on a series of studies using ISSP data, the present paper proposes a multidimensional measurement framework for meritocratic beliefs. This framework distinguishes, on the one side, between perceptions and preferences and, on the other side, between meritocratic and not meritocratic aspects. In the first study, we test the multidimensional framework for meritocratic beliefs using the ISSP 2009 inequality module through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) techniques. After identifying the advantages and some limitations of ISSP items for a multidimensional operationalization of meritocratic beliefs, in a second study, we suggest a modified set of items that better taps the different dimensions of meritocracy. We examined the measuring properties of this new instrument using a sample of Chilean adults (N = 2,141). Based on these results, we recommend improvements in measuring meritocratic beliefs in cross-national studies."

Constraints included successive reforms of the national curriculum, a resource-poor and high-surveillance education culture, and a low-priority culture of professional learning. Strategies enacted to sustain teacher agency included identifying ‘pockets of possibility’ to realise authentic chemistry education for all, developing trusting relationships with students and proactively nurturing their own professional development. These strategies have the potential to enhance the practice of teachers and teacher educators, and to inform a reorientation of policy away from high-stakes accountability."

Chile has a neo-liberal model for development and many ecological problems, which involve social and environmental injustices and an overvalue of economic growth for development. Building on the three pillars model of sustainability of interconnections among the environment, society and economy, this research aims to find out how Chilean chemistry teachers understand sustainability and its integration into teaching chemistry. Data was collected through in-depth interviews with ten teachers and an attempt to highlight teachers’ voices about what is possible to do and the impacts of connecting chemistry education and sustainability in the context of a country with a free-market approach to development, such as Chile. Findings indicate that teachers focus on using resources and environmental protection when explaining sustainability and do not relate it to political and economic implications. Teachers confirmed that sustainability integration into education promotes paramount values for living in society and foundational skills for citizenship education, such as critical thinking skills. Nevertheless, teachers focused only on personal actions and attitudes toward sustainability."

Employing a qualitative multi-case study, we conducted a total of 35 semi-structured interviews with these 25 novice teachers working in highly vulnerable schools in the Metropolitan Region of Chile. Drawing upon the literature on teacher resilience and the teacher-student relationship, we carried out a comparative analysis of the two groups. The findings reveal two significant connections and one tension: a positive connection between the student figure and the resilient novice teachers’ identity; another positive connection between professional identity and the pedagogical relationship prioritized by resilient teachers; and a tension between the pedagogical relationship prioritized by resilient novice teachers and school leadership teams’ definition of pedagogical work. These findings show how the teacher-student relationship represents the driving force of novice teachers’ pedagogical work and resilience, an essential element that persists despite the abrupt changes generated by the pandemic. Implications highlight the significance of conducting further research on relational aspects of novice teachers’ resilience and strengthening it through institutional support systems."

TThis research aims to identify the individual aspects that, added to the pedagogical work and the context in which it is developed, contribute to strengthening teacher resilience in beginning teachers. Method. Regarding methodology, this is a qualitative study of multiple cases that includes eleven beginning high school teachers working in public schools. Interviews and audio messages via the WhatsApp platform were used, which were submitted to content analysis. Results. The results show that the teachers’ main difficulty is the students’ low performance, a situation that they face from the renovation of their teaching practices in terms of didactic and evaluative aspects. The teachers interviewed share a positive vision of their students’ abilities, professional autonomy, a high commitment to student learning, a similar perspective of the meaning of their work, and their social contribution. These shared aspects contribute to a positive bond with peers and the development of collective innovations within collaborative work. Conclusion. The conclusions of the study establish the moral commitment to the teaching of teachers and the contribution of pedagogical innovation in increasing their sense of achievement, as well as the need to generate institutional conditions that allow strengthening the resilience of beginning teachers, providing them with appropriate conditions and opportunities for collaborative teaching work to consolidate professional learning communities."

El sistema Tianxia como vínculo clave entre China y América Latina | KEYWORDS: China-Latin America relations; international relations theory; Tianxia system | ABSTRACT: After the end of the Cold War, the reordering of the international system led to the emergence of proposals for global governance that were broader than those determined by the West. In this context and in China, the Tianxia system has gained notoriety as an alternative to non-Western theories of international relations and as a new framework for global governance. This article aims to analyse this system in terms of the development of Chinese foreign policy, testing its conceptual applicability in the relationship between China and Latin America through interregional cooperation, understood as a conceptual and theoretical framework of international relations that has led to progress being made in terms of dialogue and mutual knowledge. Latin America has been inserted in the Tianxia system through the Belt and Road Initiative, which is based on the contemporary reinterpretation of the Tianxia order: the Chinese concept of how the world should be organised based on a tax system, which established an international hierarchical order that brought many peoples to the Chinese imperial court."

The literature on COPs is limited and almost exclusively based on multilateral environmental agreements. The article departs from this scholarship to show that COPs are now present in different areas of international law and to discuss some of the ways in which these bodies influence the conventions that establish them. In particular, it considers how COPs affect the content and the implementation of their parent treaties. The article focuses on the bodies established by four treaties selected as case studies: the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; the Convention for the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions; the Convention on Cluster Munitions; and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Based on the examination of the normative decisions adopted by these organs, the article argues that COPs' activities (i) specify and develop the content of their parent treaties by setting procedural and substantive standards that states parties must meet to comply with their obligations; and (ii) support the implementation of their parent treaties by seeking to strengthen their social and political position, facilitating the adoption of measures by states parties. COPs pursue this second goal by building momentum in favour of the implementation of their treaties, stigmatizing their adversaries, and connecting their conventions with established international legal narratives."

This study analyzed 33 videotaped, one-on-one dialogic reading sessions implemented by 14 Chilean preservice early childhood educators and children aged 1 to 6. In total, 1289 sequences were examined for adherence to the PEER structure (prompt, evaluate, expand, and repeat), prompt type, and rate and length of children’s answer. Results showed that, on average, PSECEs executed sequences of 1.75 steps, with only 5% of all sequences reaching the final step. Furthermore, the study investigated the types of prompts employed by PSECEs. Notably, 69% of the prompts included questions, with wh-word-initiated questions comprising 46% of the total questions. Within this category, 16% were classified as high-challenge. Merely 7% of all prompts featured high-challenge questions. Children’s response rates were notably higher for prompts containing questions compared to other types of prompts, as well as for those containing wh-questions compared to other question types. Moreover, children’s answers were observed to be longer in response to prompts including high-challenge questions in contrast to other prompt types. Implications of these findings and future lines of research are discussed."

Drawing insights from literature and expert feedback, a new 10-item Likert scale instrument was created, capturing three facets of reading engagement: behavioral, social, and cognitive (Lee et al., 2021). A sample of 534 low-income 8th and 9th graders from Santiago, Chile, was used to assess TRRES's reliability for educational settings. Face validity was confirmed through expert reviews and exit interviews. Internal validity was rigorously assessed with Item Response Theory (IRT). Specifically, a polytomous Rasch model confirmed a unidimensional construct. For reliability measures, Expected A Posteriori (EAP) and Cronbach's alpha were used, resulting in very high reliability (EAP = 0.83; alpha = 0.96). To increase TRRES' practical use among teachers, a 3-item version (TRRES-A) was evaluated following criteria of being short and easy to use, yielding high reliability (EAP = 0.79; alpha = 0.87). Results highlight TRRES-A as a short, practical, and highly reliable screener for measuring reading engagement through adolescence. The initial 10-item version, suitable for qualitative purposes, complements the shorter version's practicality. Limitations include the TRRES's constrained sensitivity in distinguishing students with low levels of engagement, emphasizing the need for fine-grained analyses that yield this type of finding and inform stakeholders' decisions when choosing an instrument. Findings suggest valuable applications for educators, researchers, and policymakers seeking nuanced insights into reading engagement among adolescents."

However, a significant portion of Chilean adolescents engage in limited reading. Notably, male students tend to exhibit lower levels of reading motivation compared to their female counterparts, with declining reading self-concept over time. To address this challenge, this study explores the impact of a 9-month-long pilot reading program aimed at increasing students' reading motivation and volume in an all-boys rural school in southern Chile (N = 120), guided by Self-Determination Theory and adapted from Atwell's reading workshop. The program included four pillars: access to high-interest print books, 90 min per week of in-class independent choice, and peer interactions around reading. t-Tests showed a significant increase in students' reading volume but not in their reading motivation. Nevertheless, multiple regression analyses revealed that, when controlling for students' pre-program reading motivation, achievement, and volume, post-program reading motivation and time allocated for independent reading were significantly associated with the number of pages read during the program. Implications for practice and future research avenues are discussed."

Secondary data analysis was used to examine a sample of almost 330,000 Chilean adolescents. The results of multilevel regression models revealed that parents' reading motivation and frequency were significantly and positively associated with adolescents' reading motivation, even after controlling for their classmates' and their own previous reading achievement. Furthermore, the negative and significant association found between students' reading motivation and their socioeconomic status was smaller in effect size than that of parents' reading motivation and frequency combined. The implications and limitations of these findings are also discussed."

The results tend to support the initial hypothesis of the existence of a structure that reflects the stratification system. Hake Artisan fishermen are socially mobilized under this structure and are classified into three different strata, differentiated by: years of experience in the sector, school level, income level, capital property type and territorial ownership or residence. In smaller measure, differences with respect to the aspirations, employment expectations and commitment of Hake Artisan Fishermen with the job were observed. These being cross characteristics of each stratum in the culture of the sector."

Millions of learners worldwide experience mathematics nowadays as an inescapable tool of cognitive abuse and punitive selection. Most traditional teaching thwarts natural human cognitive resources. Problem . We would like to contribute to alleviating the aforementioned cognitive abuse, sharing the insights afforded by our exploration of enactive and metaphorical approaches to learning and teaching, inspired by E (embodied, enactive, extended, embedded, ecological)-cognition. We aim at understanding mathematical thinking processes and practicing an experimental epistemology of mathematics, not just prescribing actions to be undertaken in the classroom Method . Our theoretical scope is E-cognition. Our main research method is based on enactivism (enaction à la Varela) including metaphorical analysis, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews. Moreover, we discuss illustrative examples of learning activities related to random walks and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art & Mathematics), particularly physics and art (dance and choreography). Results . Embodiment, enacting and metaphorising make a dramatic difference in mathematics learning processes. Learning activities related to random walks and deterministic dynamical systems enacted through dance and choreography can play a significant antidotal and remedial role against cognitive abuse in the teaching of mathematics. Beneficial insights are triggered, for students, teachers, and mathematics educators. Implications . We suggest new horizons for research and practice in mathematics education informed by E-cognition and metaphorisation, with an antidotal and therapeutic effect against cognitive abuse in teaching. Further research is commendable on the often-stressful transition process from an abusive and repressive education to a more open enactivist education, which could use micro-phenomenological interviews among other techniques. It could involve scaling up our experimentation, particularly with prospective and in-service teachers. Limitations are related to the small number of students and teachers hitherto involved. Constructivist content . Our research aims at developing a radically enactivist mathematics education inspired by Varela's enaction."
2681,-1,"TITLE: Innovation in perspective: The role of creativity and open innovation in B2B, B2C, and B2G business models | KEYWORDS: Business models; Creativity; Innovation; Open innovation; SMEs | ABSTRACT: This study explores how creativity and open innovation practices (inbound and outbound) influence product innovation and innovative performance in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Chile, using B2B, B2C, and B2G business models as moderating variables. Through empirical analysis based on a sample of 536 SMEs, we applied structural equation modeling to assess the relationship between creativity, open innovation practices, and their impact on product innovation. The results reveal that creativity significantly impacts product innovation and outbound practices, while inbound practices do not directly affect product innovation. Additionally, it was found that product innovation substantially improves the innovative performance of SMEs. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how specific open innovation practices and creativity can be leveraged to enhance innovation in SMEs. Adapting these practices should consider the particularities of different business models to maximize their effectiveness."

However, the constitutional process that Chile experienced during the years 2020 to 2022 has exposed them to a different type of uncertainty that affects them differently depending on gender. This exploratory research aims to analyze how this process has generated such uncertainty and affected the perceptions of entrepreneurs, especially in relation to the changes proposed in the new constitution. The study sample includes entrepreneurs and SME executives, with a special focus on gender differences and perceptions of institutional uncertainty. The main results reveal that the constitutional process has generated concern and uncertainty among entrepreneurs, especially due to the proposed changes in social and economic rights. A greater susceptibility among female entrepreneurs stands out, which can be explained by domestic obligations and gender barriers in access to resources. Furthermore, a decrease in confidence and perception of stability in the business environment is observed, especially during the period of constitutional debate. The results of this research can help the evidence-based dialogue between the public and private sectors regarding the effects that uncertainty arising from institutional change processes has on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs’ decisions."

On the basis of 40 interviews with presidents and vicepresidents of two important employers' organizations, and applying a generational approach, it can be seen that there are significant differences in terms of their positions on this issue. The research reveals a discursive rupture in the positions of the business elite, which corroborates a distancing from the unrestricted support for the violence of the military regime, and a condemnation of it associated with a strong generational imprint."

In this respect, the scope of this interview deals with general and specific aspects of the (post-)Marxist tradition, but with an accent on the uses and abuses of the notion of hegemony, given the discursive nature of the approach in question. Thus, along with reviewing a diversity of political matters, Laclau’s notion of hegemony creates a space from which to think about the mixtures of populism."
2685,-1,"TITLE: Noxious deindustrialisation and extractivism: Quintero-Puchuncaví in the international division of labour and noxiousness | KEYWORDS: Deindustrialisation; energy transition; environmental justice; extractivism; imperialism | ABSTRACT: This article examines the paradox of ‘noxious deindustrialisation’–employment deindustrialisation in areas where significantly noxious industries are still operating–in the context of an extractivist economy in the Global South. Analysing the copper-centred industrial area of Quintero-Puchuncaví (Chile), we argue that a key element shaping patterns of local noxious deindustrialisation is the mode of insertion of the affected area in the international division of labour and noxiousness. The latter refers to the global socioecological hierarchy constituted by interconnected differentials in technological capabilities, wage levels, and environmental degradation. In countries marked by extractivism, the simple closure of polluting industries deepens the dependence of their economies on rent-bearing primary product exports, while the permanence of such industries often results in the perpetuation of ‘sacrifice zones’, where communities are exposed to severe noxiousness while receiving only meagre benefits in return. In our view, tackling the ecological crisis requires a more balanced international division of labour, as a step towards decommodifying production and nature. Without transformations in this direction, the current attempts at an energy transition risk provoking an unsustainable deepening of extractivism and inequality."

To do so, a qualitative, biographical-narrative design was used, with the participation of four female principals. The authors used semi-structured interviews with a narrative orientation to collect the information, which covered the different stages of their trajectories. The data were processed through an inductive thematic analysis. The findings revealed six common topics in their biographical trajectories: family support, personality characteristics, leadership, academic/professional excellence, interpersonal skills, and vocation. The author concludes that the biographical capital of female principals plays a fundamental role in the identity construction of their leadership, especially from a gender-sensitive perspective."

To assess students’ attitudes towards research, the attitude towards research scale was developed (EACIN). This study addresses three gaps regarding this instrument: inconsistent latent structure, lack of comparison between available versions, and absence of gender invariance analysis given previously found gender differences. We analyzed data from 358 Chilean undergraduates, assessing the different version’s dimensionality, reliability. Results revealed inadequate fit indices for all EACIN available versions. Consequently, we proposed a new solution through exploratory structural equation modeling, EACIN-23 (or the Attitude toward Research Scale, ATRS-23), with a three-factor latent structure (replicating a previously found latent structure by the scale authors) and acceptable to good goodness-of-fit. The ATRS-23 demonstrated adequate to optimal factor loadings and good reliability. Moreover, it achieved scalar invariance across genders and demonstrated excellent criterion validity. This study provides a reliable and valid psychometric version of the EACIN, capable of accurately measuring and predicting attitudes towards research, including discriminating between students with and without intentions for postgraduate studies and research careers. Given that the ATRS-23 is only available in Spanish, we provide its English version. These findings have significant implications for undergraduate education and scientific research training."

Through a qualitative methodology using semi-structured interviews, the study highlights that girls and adolescent females face extreme vulnerability in situations such as pregnancy, sexual exploitation, and other forms of aggression. Despite these challenges, strategies of agency are also identified along their journey, often involving travel with adults in relationships marked by unequal power dynamics. The interviews emphasize the urgency of prioritizing care for pregnant adolescents at border crossings, improving intersectoral coordination to provide comprehensive support, and rethinking public policies and programs from a gender perspective."

A cross-sectional design was employed in which a questionnaire was administered to 374 South American immigrants of legal age, and who had been living in Chile for more than one (1) year. Descriptive analyses along with an analysis of variance were carried out to identify possible statistically significant differences between groups. The main results indicate that the socio-demographic conditions associated with greater discrimination were: being a Venezuelan national; being a woman; living alone; and relating mainly with immigrants of a third nationality. The implications of the results are discussed and suggestions are made for future research considering the migrant population residing in this region."
2690,0,"TITLE: Stuart Hall and the Introduction of Althusser in Cultural Studies: A Thinker of Difference | KEYWORDS: difference; ideology; Marxism; overdetermination; structuralism | ABSTRACT: This article focuses on Stuart Hall’s reading of Louis Althusser’s main theoretical works. Since the early 1970s, Hall has undertaken a critical confrontation with Althusser’s ‘structural Marxism’, rescuing those useful concepts to think cultural difference and identity, without failing to criticize his ‘superstructuralist’ interpretation of Marx. However, what Hall will retain as Althusser’s most important contribution is, above all, his theory of ideology. In this context, I follow an idea formulated by Hall that could be read as summarizing the theoretical and political scope of Althusser’s contribution to Cultural Studies: ‘he enabled me to live in and with difference’. By complicating classical interpretations schemes in the Marxist tradition, Hall’s Althusser may be read as a ‘thinker of difference’ who opens up a whole research program to reconsider class conflicts as traversed (or ‘overdetermined’) by gender, racial or colonial conflicts."
2691,6,"TITLE: Is moving the solution? Evidence from a social housing demolition program in Santiago, Chile | KEYWORDS: demolition; neighborhood attachment; policy; Residential mobility; social housing | ABSTRACT: In 2013, a social housing demolition program was implemented in Santiago, Chile. The program was voluntary, and residents were required to apply collectively. This article employs mixed methods to explore the decision-making processes of residents who stayed and those who moved. Residents resisted the negative narratives of their areas, demonstrating alternative ways of thinking about the neighborhood, and expected to move close-by, although to different kinds of units. Other residents recognized the negative effects of high turnover, including insecurity and distrust, and were willing to leave. Their experiences provide insights to reflect on the reach of mobility programs."
2692,-1,"TITLE: Does residential mobility affect educational outcomes? Evidence from Chile | KEYWORDS: demolition; Housing; planning; residential mobility; vouchers | ABSTRACT: There is mixed evidence about the effects of residential mobility on children’s educational outcomes. In 2013, the Chilean Ministry of Housing implemented a social housing demolition programme, which focused on projects with severe structural and overcrowding problems. Residents from demolished buildings received a subsidy to relocate. In this paper, I conduct a two-way fixed effects analysis and mediation analysis to explore if residential mobility during school years affects attendance and grades for children who moved with this programme, compared to those who were eligible but did not move. Using data for the 2012–2018 period, I find that moving is associated with a decrease in attendance, but the decrease is reduced if the distance between housing and the school is less than 1 km. Moving is not associated with a change in grades, but attendance is, and acts as a mediator between moving and grades."

Postcolonial theories, in this sense, have longed enriched a criticality committed to the deconstruction of Western ways of knowing by interrogating and dislocating mainstream notions of science, modernity, and identity. Still, it seems necessary to engage in a discussion about how it would be possible to carry out research with a post-colonial perspective on current identity formation scenarios strongly marked by new pathways of social mobility in the Global South. This paper focuses on two contributions to postcolonial thought: 1) multiplicity, 2) and concrete study analysis. In it, the authors seek to share their experience designing a complementary qualitative framework underpinned by these terms that serve to translate and contextualize the model of Community Cultural Wealth (Yosso, 2005) as applied to developing global education research about immigrant students and their emerging educational pathways in relatively new pathways of social mobility in South America. By drawing on lessons learned from the ongoing research built on the testimonios of Latin American students and their mothers in the northern region of Chile, the authors share analytical strategies that deploy post-colonial perspectives to complement the content and narrative analysis normally deployed in ethnographic educational methods. Finally, this paper contributes to the ongoing discussion about fractures, expansions, and openings within post-critical educational investigations regarding methodological aspects; postcolonial thought contributes to the reinvention of new ways of thinking about cultural diversity in education."

This article draws attention to the generation of racializing discourses, particularly towards the Haitian immigrant population in Chile, in (a) mass media, which mainly focuses on radio, television, and newspapers such as Radio Bíobío, Chilevision, and La Tercera newspaper, and (b) government policy, as articulated in the 2018 executive order “Plan Humanitarian Orderly Return” (PHOR). After delineating the historical background of recent Haitian migration to Chile, authors deploy Critical Discourses Analysis (CDA) of two powerful cases of popularly mediated racializing discourses reflected in media coverage of (a) the case of a Haitian woman, Joane Florvil, who died soon after taken into police custody on a wrongful charge of abandoning her infant in 2017 and (b) the racially inflected 2018 executive order PHOR which overwhelmingly targeted Haitians for “voluntary deportation”. Authors consider headlines, article coverage of institutional agents and minority subjects, and state-generated documents. Informed by postcolonial thought, the study discusses current expressions of racialized boundaries in the Chilean media focusing particularly on the disciplining and regulation of migrants based on the idea of order."
2695,0,"TITLE: Bullying and training: the perspective of university professors in physical education and sport | KEYWORDS: coaches; harassment between equals; physical activity; teachers; training; university | ABSTRACT: Bullying is a social problem in sports and physical education (PE) classes. This means PE, physical activity (PA), and sports professionals need to receive specific training in order to prevent, identify, and respond when bullying occurs. With that in mind, university education should offer content that helps these professionals gain the tools and skills needed to deal with the issue. The aim of this study was to determine university professors’ perceptions of education on the topic of bullying in Elementary Education with a major in Physical Education (EEPE) and in Exercise and Sports Science degrees (ESS). The study was based on a focus group (FG) with participation of researchers with expertise in bullying who teach university classes within the EEPE or ESS degree. The data were analyzed via thematic analysis using the Atlas.ti® version 9 application. The main results showed that the groups of experts reported little training on the topic of bullying among the students in the aforementioned degrees and noted a lack of training among the university professors in terms of including bullying content within the courses. In conclusion, these results may help broaden knowledge about the lack of training and the need to include bullying content in EEPE and ESS degrees."
2696,0,"TITLE: Capoeira as a critical pedagogy tool in physical education: from a continuing professional development program to the classroom | KEYWORDS: Capoeira; coeducation; critical pedagogy; interculturality; social justice | ABSTRACT: Background: In this globalized world with a predominantly Eurocentric/androcentric approach to physical education (PE) teaching, there is a need to broaden school curricula from a critical, decolonizing approach. Capoeira is a manifestation of Afro-Brazilian popular culture combining dance, fight, and play that has historical links to slavery. Because it is removed from the hegemonic culture of sport and physical activity, it can be used to develop critical pedagogy through movement and corporeality. Teachers, however, must be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to implement this critical approach in their curricula. A team of researchers at the National Institute of Physical Education of Catalonia (INEFC) developed a continuing professional development (CPD) course to introduce PE teachers to the history and potential of capoeira as a socio-critical pedagogical tool. Purpose: To explore the opportunities and challenges that capoeira brings as a pedagogical tool for addressing social issues as perceived by PE teachers who took a CPD course on capoeira (Capoeira-CPDC). Methodology: This study was divided into two phases: an initial phase analyzing the TTC on capoeira as a pedagogical tool for PE taken by 12 PE teachers and a second phase analyzing the transfer of knowledge by a primary and a secondary school teacher from the same school who participated in the course. Data were collected via participative and non-participative observation with analysis of diary entries made by the lead researcher-teacher educator, the 12 teachers who participated in the Capoeira-CPDC in phase 1, and the two teachers who incorporated capoeira into their PE classes in phase 2; answers to the course feedback form; and transcripts from a semi-structured interview held with the two teachers who taught capoeira. Results: The Capoeira-CPDC and subsequent incorporation of capoeira into primary and secondary school PE classes showed a wide array of benefits and limitations that this practice can offer in terms of addressing social justice, interculturality, and coeducation issues. The socio-critical pedagogical model employed in the Capoeira-CPDC, which focused on both the technical aspects of capoeira and the historical and cultural significance of the movements involved, fostered active-reflective thinking among the participating teachers. Certain challenges, however, were observed in the second phase of the study, in particular difficulties dealing directly with the subject of slavery in PE classes, a romantic-assimilation-based vision of physical activity and sport as an intercultural tool, and gender-role stereotyping by teachers. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of capoeira as a pedagogical tool for addressing social justice, interculturality, and coeducation issues from a socio-critical approach. It also highlights potential difficulties in the classroom and the importance of addressing social justice issues in PE teacher CPD courses and facilitating tools to work on cultural diversity and gender belief systems."

One of the existing approaches corresponds to a five-year university degree. School mathematics is among the various subjects that make up the formative plans for careers. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to characterise the knowledge for mathematics teaching offered by the course syllabuses related to school mathematics in the initial education of prospective special education teachers. Design: This research is framed within a qualitative approach from a descriptive and interpretative perspective. Specifically, a non-interactive qualitative approach was used. Setting and Participants: Thirty-one subject syllabuses from 12 universities of the Council of Deans of Chilean Universities were analysed. Data collection and analysis: The syllabuses were analysed through a content analysis that combined concept-driven and data-driven development and was carried out sequentially. Results: The results show that the content knowledge focuses on numbers and operations from a procedural and definitional perspective. On the other hand, pedagogical content knowledge focuses on the design of interventions. Conclusions: We conclude that knowledge for teaching mathematics in special education needs to include mathematics educators in the discussion about what knowledge special educators should have."
2700,10,"TITLE: The Internal Morality of Criminal Law | KEYWORDS: criminal law; criminal theory; morality; philosophy of law | ABSTRACT: — According to a popular picture, criminal law lives up to the demands of its internal morality when its norms have counterparts with the same content in morality—when it conforms to what we call the mirror principle. This article argues that the popular picture must be redrawn by relying on a second principle, which we call the instrumental principle. Criminal law conforms to the instrumental principle when the existence of its norms helps to prevent or ameliorate moral wrongdoing. Our argument is that the instrumental principle forms part of the internal morality of criminal law, and supplies a justification for criminal laws that depart from the mirror principle. We further suggest that criminal law’s internal morality is asymmetrical: though departures from the mirror principle are sometimes justified by the instrumental principle, departures from the latter are not justified by the former."

2705,0,"TITLE: Caring leadership in early childhood education in Chile: tensions from a highly gendered context | KEYWORDS: caring leadership; early childhood education; gender; Professionalism | ABSTRACT: Educational leadership at early childhood education (ECE) has been extensively studied. However, evidence from Chile is still scarce. As with many parts of the world, the ECE workforce is very female-heavy and Chile is no exception to this. This situation presents an intriguing context for leadership studies as particularities of a gendered role for women as leaders in Chile has not been a matter of analysis. Leadership in ECE includes a sense of vocation or ‘passion’ for children’s care, development, and learning, called caring leadership. This concept highlights an ethical component, interpersonal relations and a concern for the well-being. This article presents the findings of a three-year study involving 12 women leaders in ECE who established a Professional Learning Community. They were interviewed throughout the research. Findings reveal three tensions. Firstly, leadership is associated with a maternal role, perpetuating gender stereotypes. The second tension addresses the dynamics of personal connections within ECE teams in terms of asymmetry or horizontality. The third tension arises from the significance of caring as a crucial aspect of working in ECE education. These tensions underscore the need for a critical analysis of leadership in ECE, as gender considerations may overlook the complexity of the leaders’ role."

A relational analysis in educational centers in Porto Alegre (Brazil) and Barcelona (Spain) La profesionalización docente frente a los retos sociales y educativos contemporáneos. Un análisis relacional en centros educativos de Porto Alegre (Brasil) y Barcelona (España) | KEYWORDS: Professionalization; Social transformation; Teaching practice | ABSTRACT: Neoliberal policies, the lack of professional recognition and social problems such as inequality and the need for greater justice and social equity deeply affect teaching professions in different parts of the world. These dynamics erode the autonomy of teachers and limit the possibilities for pedagogical innovation. Within this framework, this article addresses these issues in two territorial settings: Porto Alegre (Brazil) and Barcelona (Spain). The objective has been to understand how teachers face the contemporary challenges of professionalization, but specifically to analyze the relationships between educational policies (agenda-setting), local contexts (enacting) and effects on professionalization; the practices, meanings and tensions attributed to the profession. This investigation is framed in a multiple case study design, centered on analyzing experiences in educational centers in Brazil and Spain, through the collection of qualitative data through meetings, visual maps, interviews, a discussion group, surveys and documentary analysis. Data analysis is based on a thematic content analysis strategy, organized around three predefined dimensions: context; visions about the role of profession, school; tensions facing the challenges of the teaching profession. In both contexts, it is observed that the teaching profession is crossed by shared challenges, such as the lack of social recognition and the need for psychosocial support. However, community patrons also emerge who highlight the importance of collaborative networks and their efforts to build a more democratic and transformative education. In conclusion, the need to articulate policies that promote well-being, continued training and a teaching career and strengthened professional development as part of justice and social development is highlighted."

This article aims to provide evidence on families' perceptions of the trust they place in schools in the care of their children or wards when using this type of digital resources or media, and the possible implications of this for children's rights. Drawing on a quantitative methodology that included the application of a questionnaire to families with children enrolled in a public school in Catalonia (n=1,639), we shed light on a wide range of perceptions around the use of digital educational platforms. While some participants value the usefulness of these platforms during the pandemic, others express concerns related to data privacy and the possibility of discrimination and cyberbullying. It is concluded that there is a need to stimulate further research focusing on the key role of families in addressing the ethical and social issues arising from digitisation in education."

The research objective behind this article was to analyse the concerns of school students in obligatory primary and second‑ ary education in public schools within the Autonomous Region of Catalonia (Spain) together with the opinions of their families regarding the use of digital platforms offered by large technology companies (BigTech) in schools. This is a mixed design study, consisting of eight discussion groups with pupils (n=56) and a questionnaire issued to 2, 330 family members. The results show that both students and families are concerned about the lack of knowledge surrounding the data they generate when using these digital platforms, and their effect on democratic school governance and the reproduction of gender stereotypes. In conclusion, the study suggests it is nec‑ essary to create greater critical awareness among children, adolescents and families at all socio‑economic levels, particularly in those who are most vulnerable."

RESPONSABILIDAD Y JUSTICIA INSTITUCIONAL EN UNA SOCIEDAD PLATAFORMIZADA | KEYWORDS: Digital platforms; Educational innovation, datafication; Educational innovations; Educational technology; University | ABSTRACT: The use of digital platforms by the university communities to produce knowledge, research, teaching, and management has not only intensified but it has also diversified since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a context where higher education and the use of digital technologies are increasingly intertwined, universities can take advantage of this unplanned hiper-digitalization event to explore fundamental questions about learning and researching in a post-digital landscape. This article is the result of an exploratory study based on a co-design and virtual ethnography, analyzing the attributes and foci of 31 ""data research center"" in universities from 16 countries. Although the centers analyzed have different profiles and approaches, they all investigate the intensive use of data and its political-social implications, with a special interest in the fair and ethical use of data for administrative, research, and pedagogical activities. As result, this work provides 20 proposals, grouped into 4 dimensions of possible institutional areas of development for universities. These proposals aim to contribute to the critical analysis of how higher education institutions can play a central role to face the growing relevance of advanced data systems in our societies."

We highlight at least four functions that need to be consolidated: (a) Data awareness, (b) Multi-disciplinary research capacities, (c) Data monitoring, and (d) Ombudsman services. We examine what institutional capacities are needed to understand, adopt, or confront the increasing challenges of an ‘algorithmic education’ and how these abilities could contribute to navigate an education landscape that faces profound transformations."

Revuelta social en Chile: ¿una contrahegemonía política que impugna el relato neoliberal? | KEYWORDS: counter hegemony; cultural change; democracy; neo-Liberalism; social movements | ABSTRACT: On the 18th of October 2019, Chile began undergoing the biggest political and social upheaval since the one that ended the Pinochet dictatorship. This upheaval slowly gave way to a process of impeachment of the traditional institutions of The State. This paper looks at the political dimension of the ensuing social revolt and its scope in the constituent itinerary agreed on the 15th of November 2019. It seeks to answer the question of whether the great mass movement was the expression of a political counter-hegemony challenging the Neo-Liberal order. To this end, it draws on the main theoretical currents questioning the fit between democracy and Neo-Liberalism, especially Chantal Mouffe's ‘agonistic’ proposal of the populist moment. In practical terms, it analyses, on the basis of past political and electoral behaviour, two cleavages that could be identified with the emergence of the populist moment, that of elite/people and parties/independents. From the analysis of the electoral data of the last thirty years and related to the results of the 2021 election of the members of the Constituent Convention, it is concluded that political weariness was reflected in the two cleavages defining the populist moment. In addition, there was a strengthening of the various political forces that saw themselves as anti-Neo-Liberal."

Faced with this challenge, higher education institutions must address fundamental questions about learning in a postdigital landscape. This chapter explores how universities have created or adapted research centres to deal with data generation in their day-to-day activities. Although the centres analysed in this chapter have different profiles and expertise, they all seek to better prepare higher education institutions to cope with the datafication of society manifested in different ways (e.g. digital inclusion, artificial intelligence, privacy, ethical use of data, etc.). Based on a co-design and virtual ethnography, this work is structured in two phases: (1) identification and analysis of 31 websites affiliated to university datafication centres and (2) selection and deepening on four core dimensions of work of these centres. These comparative results highlight global trends, research agendas and priorities, but also illustrate the need to move towards a more multidisciplinary approach, understanding data not only as “tools” but also as “subjects” with an increasingly economical and symbolic power."

Análisis del Caso Español | KEYWORDS: Digital transformation; Educational technology; Mobile phone; Pandemic; Schools | ABSTRACT: In front of the Covid-19 pandemic, multiple educational contexts experienced a sudden and accelerated digital transformation. But this impulse is not new. Public and private initiatives in this direction have been designed and experimented with in Spain for years. In this sense, the role and use of mobile phones in the classroom has been a key and controversial aspect. The aim of this paper was to analyse the complexity of the digital transformation of schools based on the extensive, universal and controversial use of mobile phones by secondary school students. Based on qualitative research, nine active interviews were conducted with relevant actors in the field of educational technology in Spain. With the evidence, a discourse analysis was carried out where, based on the generation of consensus and agreements, the participants' statements were grouped into four categories. As a result, it is affirmed that in order to consolidate the digitalisation of educational centres and promote an adequate use of mobile phones in the classroom, it is important to: have appropriate technical elements and infrastructure; adequate educational regulations; strengthen the role of the school; and build new pedagogical models."

This phenomenon, intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, needs to be understood and analyzed by different perspectives and actors to find answers that allow for more sensible and secure use of these tools in educational contexts. In this scenario, this article explores the narratives on the protection of the privacy of users of digital platforms in schools and the protection of children's rights by the main actors in the educational field. The qualitative study is based on 14 interviews with key informants and analyzes their positions and statements concerning the use of commercial digital platforms in schools, the management of data, children's rights and the right to privacy. The results of this research shed light on the discursive tensions between the different educational actors around the entry of digital platforms of technological corporations in public schools."

This article presents the results of a study aimed at identifying and analyzing the main aspects that create tensions in the discourse of three stakeholder groups regarding the use of commercial digital platforms in schools in Catalonia, Spain. Through qualitative research, in-depth interviews were conducted with six school directors, four representatives from the public administration, and three representatives from major technological corporations. Subsequently, a relational discourse analysis was carried out, allowing the results to be categorized into the following three areas: (1) services and products of commercial digital platforms; (2) uses of commercial digital platforms in the education system; and (3) management and use of data by commercial digital platforms in the education system. The results highlight the need for greater involvement of the public administration to ensure a safe use of these digital resources in schools and to protect the rights of children."

In this article we identify some of the tensions that the intensification in the adoption of digital educational platforms has brought to light in the school and family environment. Based on a mixed methodological design, which included six in-depth interviews with school principals and a survey of 2112 families, we analysed the positions of the school community and families on the use of digital educational platforms in public schools in Catalonia. The results reveal conflicts linked to the ""need"" to adapt to a post-digital reality in which adopting critical -minority- positions is perceived as a threat to the free development of professional practice and to equal access to education. At the same time, the results underline the role of teachers in the deepening of critical and reflective positions that make it possible, also for students, to question naturalised forms of work and interaction."

Resistencias y vincularidades en la experiencia escolar del estudiantado chileno | KEYWORDS: ""Bonds""; Counter-hegemony; Neoliberalism; Resistances; School; School experience | ABSTRACT: This article aims to analyze how in school daily life students produce the reality through practices and relationships that contest the structuring principles of the neoliberal educational order. When these practices materialize, they recreate alternative ways for students of constituting themselves as subjects and setting social 'bonds', opening the possibility to build a ""presentist"" praxis for a kind of lived or experiential counter-hegemony. To support these propositions, a narrative-biographical approach research was carried out with 30 Chilean high school students from different socio-economic groups (SEG) The results show that -although differently for each socio-economic group-, the experiential counter-hegemony is manifested through two main expressions: resistances and 'bonds'. The articulation of these two, as we will discuss later, can serve as a support for the emergence of a hidden counter-curriculum with a transformative orientation."

Shadowing is a relatively new ethnographic strategy in Spanish-speaking academic environments, that precisely emerges in order to highlight the importance of the observation of specific contexts and communities for educational research. Thus, the objective of this article is to show the main characteristics, possibilities, and limitations of shadowing for educational research. From a qualitative approach, a literature review of 37 scientific articles describing and reporting results on its use has been carried out. The reported findings are organized into three categories: (1) its origin, application areas and characterization, (2) experiences and uses of the strategy and (3) its ethical-pragmatic implications. Additionally, some final reflections on its usefulness and validity for generating localized educational knowledge are raised."

Globally, Zoom has faced several concerns to do with privacy, encryption and unauthorised calls. This study explores how different South American countries govern the use of commercial platforms in education systems and to what extent they alert their citizens from the potential risks. The analysis focused on public education institutions from eight countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay) and how they reacted (or not) to protect student and teacher privacy at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. The questions of this ethnographic study were: How public institutions of South America reacted when the privacy risks of Zoom were made known? Where did they put their emphasis? What lessons can be learned? This chapter is of special interest for education policy makers interested in understanding the opportunities of digital technologies but also the unintended consequences. This study underscores the necessity to revise and adjust the current regulations and the importance of transforming the existing institutional capacities to effectively execute digital governance."

Insecurity and recomposition of possibilities in the current political-pedagogical context Pedagogías de la precariedad en el orden educativo neoliberal. Inseguridad y recomposición de las posibilidades en el actual contexto político-pedagógico | KEYWORDS: agency; critical literacy; education; Neoliberalism; precariousness | ABSTRACT: The aim of this article is to analyse how neoliberal principles in education create a state of precariousness. The question that will guide the problematisation and the argumentation of the work is: What is the «status» of precariousness in the current order and how does it manifest itself - expressly or inadvertently - in the contemporary educational field? In order to address this question, a theoretical-analytical exercise has been carried out based on a review of relevant literature on the relationship between neoliberalisation and education. As a central hypothesis, we propose that the processes of precarisation constitute an objective necessity for the expansion and reproduction of the new neoliberal order. In addition, this order requires the production of a specific type of subjectivity that normalizes «precariousness» as a new historical condition, producing a particular notion of subjectivity and agency. The intersection between objective needs and the production of a particular subjectivity is produced in the cultural space through «pedagogies of precariousness». The installation of such pedagogies in formal education systems will be verified through the analysis of three predominant figures: the entrepreneur, the apprentice of competences and the teacher as technician. Finally, it is analysed how a «pedagogy of possibilities» could be opposed to «pedagogies of precariousness», enabling other forms of educational relations and new political-pedagogical horizons."

These institutions all offer “online education” with diverse institutional, technological, and pedagogical processes. However, a fundamental element has to do with the experience of the students, and how they adapt to the educational model of the online university in which they are studying. In this article, we present the main results of the case-study developed in one of the most historical and relevant virtual universities in an international context. We have explored and analysed the process of adaptation to the educational model by the student body, and their perceptions of their interactions with the pedagogical, institutional, and technological elements designed to support their learning. Qualitative and quantitative methods are used to gather and analyse the data. From 1715 students who participated in the survey and the perceptions of 30 students individually interviewed, the results show positive evaluations regarding the integration and adoption of technological competencies, and also, that the online education generally serves as a responsive model to the emergent needs of the learner. However, the results also show that students have important concerns regarding the pedagogical and institutional support provided."

Nostalgia for physical presence and the massive digitalization of teaching and learning processes have generated a set of uncertain challenges that should be faced once the crisis is overcome. This article is the result of a study which sought to identify the main issues and challenges regarding the meaning of the school experience in the era (and after-era) of COVID-19. Based on a hermeneutic approach and a qualitative methodological proposal based on co-design, the results of the analysis of interviews conducted with 21 experts from Argentina, Australia, Chile, Spain, France, England and Venezuela are presented. Among the results, a total of 40 emerging issues about the school and its meaning in the pandemic are proposed. We conclude by recognizing the urgency of revaluing the school as an educational, socializing and transforming institution that generates spaces of encounter, care, critical literacy and exchange."

Among the measures adopted to achieve such equity is the creation of a State Guaranteed Student Credit (SCSC) as a tool to finance university studies. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of this policy, both in the configuration of the current university market and in the perception of its “beneficiaries.” Through a mixed methodological approach, which included documentary review and individual interviews with students who were beneficiaries of the SCSC, three dimensions of analysis were generated. The results show the existence of complex interfaces between the educational reality, public policy, and the experience of students. In effect, while a look at the objectivity of the system demonstrates the neoliberal support and reinforcement of the “bankarization” of educational financing, the perspective of the beneficiaries is that the SCSC represents a unique opportunity to access higher education."

From a qualitative approach, and based on a comparative documentary study, an integral vision of the scenario of policies and instruments of public action for the schooling of foreign students was built in both contexts. The results show more contrasts than similarities. Among the differences, the different configuration processes of these actions are highlighted, where the evolution of the migratory phenomenon and the characteristics of their political and educational systems influence. They also contrast the areas addressed by these actions and the ways in which inclusive education for foreign students is materialized. The most relevant similarity is the incorporation of inclusive education and intercultural education as central approaches of both educational systems and of the actions in favor of the schooling of these students. The value of the comparative study lies in the extensive and in-depth look at the development of educational policies and public action instruments to address the accelerated flow of migrants in school systems."

The global pandemic of Covid-19 is accelerating the expansion of digital platforms in education. Google is the technology corporation that, through Google for Education, is leading educational innovation through its digital platforms. In this context, the objective of this article is to analyze innovation in educational practices and teacher training through Google's digital platforms. From a qualitative approach based on the implementation of a digital ethnography and a technography, eight Google websites related to teacher training and data have been analyzed in depth. The results of the study show that, through the Classroom API (1) new techno-educational control processes are being generated, (2) new extractive dynamics of data and (3) new relationships are forming with the technology industry. Alongside this, it is observed that teacher training for techno-educational innovation in Google is based on pyramidal professional development, through teaching certifications, and on ""Google educational communities"" that are self-formed and expand the tools and market logics of this technology corporation."

This unprecedented situation has led to multiple challenges in the host countries in terms of managing the social integration process of migrants. The situation has particularly affected minors, with the consequent impact on local education systems. Within this context, the MICREATE project — Migrant Children and Communities in a Transforming Europe (HORIZON 2020–822664) — emerged, whose main objective is to identify and meet the specific needs of children and young migrants related to integration into the host societies via school. The research is being conducted using a mixed methodology with a child-centred approach in order to avoid the assumptions with which adults tend to think about integration. In this way, we seek to create a space that enables them to express their interests and experiences. This project, which will last three years, is expected to enable us to rethink integration policies and strategies by generating new knowledge and promoting new solutions for education institutions and policies."

The results delve into the shortcomings and tensions of public policies for social inclusion, identified by policymakers, management teams, NGO directors and researchers from across the country. The analysis reveals that educational policies leave in the schools' hands a whole series of challenges that must be solved to promote the students' social inclusion. However, schools cannot assume many of these challenges, as their resolution is not within their reach. The paper points out key issues that must be urgently addressed from policies, especially in relation to inter and intra-school and inter-school segregation, resource management and the consolidation of a sustainable and coordinated network of educational actors."

This work aims to explore the relationship between education and digital technology in an interrogative way through the characterization of a series of areas and questions that require routes of reflection, work and research beyond the question about the didactic material in education. It is part of the pedagogical reflection and seeks to provide elements that allow identifying future itineraries, paradoxes or research problems. The qualitative methodological procedure was participatory co-design in three non-sequential work phases: discovery, ideation and prototyping. As results 5 fields are presented: epistemological, purpose, content, didactics and evaluation. The construction of educational meaning of technology implies attending to these problematic nuclei of pedagogical representation to think about technology with all its potential, but also with all its dilemmas. Rather than closing the analytical focus, here it seeks to open reflective spaces to face the challenge of legitimation"

All education in the 21st century is digital education in that the use of networking, text and image creation and editing and search and retrieval of information punctuates the life of almost every teacher and student. However, the context of distance education - where all the interactions are mediated, creates a unique and heightened context of digitalization. This paper focuses on two questions: (1) What aspects have not been completely satisfactory in the transit and transformation that education has undergone, from its more traditional, campus-based conception, towards its new configuration marked by the continuous use of digital technologies and environments? (2) What are the future challenges that distance education must deal with to support sustainability of this teaching model? From a theoretical and interpretative analysis, based on the review of relevant articles and documents on distance education, some critical dimensions (limitations, shortcomings and future challenges) the use of digital technologies in distance education is identified and subsequently analyzed. These dimensions evidence how the initial (sometimes excessive) promises of digital technologies in distance education has not (yet) been fully reflected in reality."

The relevance of digital devices and associated indicators are used as proxies to measure the development of societies today. In that context, both top-down and/or bottom-up technology in education initiatives seek to promote different forms of incorporating digital technologies in educational contexts. There are many successful experiences around the world to implement digital technologies in school contexts. However, it is critical to analyze the mismatch between the expectations and the reality but also to enquire how to provide better evidence and analysis to deepen and expand the knowledge in the field of education and technology from the Top-Down and Bottom-Up initiatives. Keeping that in mind, an international call for papers was launched that finally 14 contributions from 12 countries were included in this special issue. The articles shed light about two important aspects: (1) how good technical solutions cannot ignore the context in which these digital technologies are being used or adopted. (2) how the access to technologies can simply amplify the existing inequalities within a society (as well as between different societies) if additional (in most cases non-technical) components are not being carefully considered."

The cases of emergence and consolidation of podemos in Spain and Revolución Democrática in Chile El partido-movimiento como expresión de la democracia radical. Emergencia y consolidación de Podemos en España y Revolución Democrática en Chile | KEYWORDS: Agonist pluralism; Democracy; Inequality; Parties; Political culture | ABSTRACT: The financial crisis of 2008, whose worst effects were felt in developed countries, reignited the political dispute over ideological hegemony. It showed the dysfunction existing between material and immaterial goods produced by capitalist society, and the citizenry's satisfaction with these goods in consolidated democracies. In Spain and Chile, this dysfunction originated new political movements that sought to represent the old unresolved injustices for liberal democracy, and the new tensions that emerged with and after the economic crisis. This article addresses this process through the comparative analysis of a conjunction of structural and supra-structural factors, in order to understand the emergence and consolidation of Podemos in Spain and the Democratic Revolution in Chile as movement-parties. To achieve this goal, and based on a theoretical framework focused on the premises of radical democracy and agonist pluralism and the characteristics of the party-movement, we explore the socioeconomic, cultural and institutional conditions that may explain the emergence and consolidation of this type of ""political parties."" Based on this analysis, it is concluded that: 1) the emergence of both parties is explained by the material conditions of inequality in both countries; 2) in their origins, the two parties can be clearly defined as movement-parties; and 3) these parties have become an alternative to traditional parties, but within the political regime they are challenging."

Educators, schools and corporations are increasingly driving these initiatives. This article makes the argument that a narrow vision of digital technology, which both ignores the complexity of education and wastes valuable public resources, is becoming an obstacle to significant improvement and transformation in education. Utilising our research and experience in the field of educational technology, this paper problematises the common elision of ‘technology’ and ‘digital technology’. From this basis, we then critically reflect on various common approaches to introducing digital technology in education under the guise of promoting equality and digital inclusion. These include national government-led programmes, more recent trends for local school-led initiatives, and the role of non-formal education initiatives led by corporations/foundations. Amidst the varying surface-level ‘failure’ and/or ‘success’ of these approaches, we point to limited underpinning ‘information and knowledge society’ logics in framing the application of digital technology to education. As such we conclude by considering the educational challenges for future Ed-Tech initiatives."

The article analyzes a critically dimension, such as the scarce link with the environment shown by regional universities in Chile. Through the application and analysis of twenty-four interviews with various incumbent actors, the emergence of new sources of legitimacy with counter-hegemonic potential is confirmed. Specifically, these sources are presented as a theoretical and critical alternative to the neoliberal axioms and principles that shape the tertiary education system in Chile. In the same way, they act in opposition to the processes of State-national homogenization that this system promotes."

Technology has provided solutions to access information, for communication and collaborative work. Blockchain emerges as a technology that can be useful for the development of an evaluation model of individualized learning itineraries in mass university subjects. In this line, the Edublocs project has been designed and executed, an initiative where these itineraries have been designed, incorporating elements of peer learning, team-teaching, PLEs, microlearning, technology-enhanced assessment... The objective of the Edublocs project is to design and implement a system of recording the results of activities through Blockchain that allow the student to follow a personal itinerary, and the teacher-tutor of the subject to carry out a formative evaluation and an accrediting appraisal of their work. The project is well underway in the evaluation of the implementation process. The experience with some elements of the design and the experimental execution in a formal university context during the present academic course, has allowed us to obtain important indications on the viability and relevance of the use of Blockchain in education. These, together with the explanation and justification of explaining the context of its applicability, will be laid out in the broad development of the article."

For this, an in from the premises of radical democracy regarding the construction of the antagonistic other and the notion of party-movement. From this framework is made a comparative analysis of the cases of Podemos and the Frente Amplio, carried out based on four political change dimensions: socio-economic conditions, political-cultural rupture, actions and discourses of hegemonic construction, and solidification of a generational break. Based on this analysis it is possible to verify, although with different intensity, that political and cultural factors existed that allowed to materialize in political parties the dynamics of opposition to the neoliberal social structure of social movements."

In some cases, young people feel that belonging to online communities may serve as a refuge, a safe and stable place, in a modern society where everything else is moving. In this chapter we analyze how a sense of belonging develops for young members of virtual communities, as well as what mechanisms of regulation and self-regulation are adopted by young people actively constructing their identities in online spaces. We draw on the results of an ethnographic case study of Feminismes, a Facebook group with high participation of Spanish youth, aged between 15 and 29 years old. We aim to contribute to the intersection between sociology, education and technology, from the theoretical perspective of belonging, and by drawing upon social theories that approach the changing nature of the late modernity, and new ways of social participation. The results of our study indicate that a shared sense of belonging to a community that encourages personal expression in the face of oppression may make social bonds stronger. Nevertheless, creating safe spaces online also raises some contradictions between feeling free and establishing boundaries, or between promoting social inclusion as well as social fragmentation."

The project was organized in three phases: (1) detection and mapping of virtual communities with high participation of young people between 15 and 29 years old; (2) selection and in-depth study of 7 virtual communities; and (3) creation and distribution of an online questionnaire to calibrate the extension of the phenomenon. The project started with an intentional sampling of 24 virtual communities with high youth participation, which allowed to categorize the particularities of these communities. Building from the results of the first phase of the research, seven case studies were implemented in each community, doing 2-4 semi-structured interviews to the participants and collecting evidences through observations in the virtual environments. The results are presented in this article, specially focusing on four categories: interest to participate, participatory culture, learning dynamics and knowledge expansion. The discussion presents expose how virtual communities have became one of the quotidian contexts of young people, broading their opportunities to learn."

La creación de paradigmas antagónicos a partir del discurso de política pública, el discurso académico y la investigación educativa | KEYWORDS: Crisis of meaning; Politics of meaning; Public policy; Schooling; Schooling experience | ABSTRACT: Since the transition to democracy onwards it has been generated a diagnostic reporting about the crisis of the secondary educational system in Chile. The objective of this article focuses on analyzing the consistency of that diagnostic in one of its main dimension: the so-called ""crisis of meaning"". In order to do that this research examines three approaches related to this issue: discourses from public policies, academia and empirical research. We find that while the first two discourses confirm the critical diagnosis, the conclusions in the empirical research reject this idea. These finding put in perspective the hegemony that an interpretative paradigm has gained in the analysis of the educational system and the difficulties to link the different dimensions in this matter and the process of creation of the educational meaning. To avoid this limitation, this study proposes to highlight the experience of the main participants of the educational system based on a research focused on the relevance of that experience."

El caso de la Universidad regional de Aysén (UAY) | KEYWORDS: Center-periphery policies; Chilean higher education policies; Políticas centro-periferia; Políticas de educación superior chilenas; Universidad y desarrollo regional; University and regional development | ABSTRACT: The analysis of the case of the University of Aysén presented in this work allows us to describe and understand some of the difficulties that regional universities in Chile have in relation with their territory and their impact on local development. This problem, which shows the inequality and weakness of the Chilean education system, appears continually in various national and international assessments. Our thesis is that these difficulties are one of the many expressions of the persistence of a center-periphery cleavage manifested in a territorial insensitivity or centralist paradigm in public policies in Chile, which have been oriented towards homogeneous and centralist responses in response to different needs and territorial realities. This situation happens regardless of the political orientation of the government (democratic or authoritarian) or the pre-eminence of state or market planning as a regulator of the system. El análisis del caso de la Universidad de Aysén, que presenta este trabajo, permite describir y comprender algunas de las dificultades que muestran las universidades regionales en Chile para vincularse con su territorio e impactar en el desarrollo local. Este problema, que evidencia una arista de desigualdad y debilidad del sistema de educación chileno, es una constante en las diferentes evaluaciones nacionales e internacionales. Nuestra tesis es que estas dificultades son una de las tantas expresiones de la persistencia de un clivaje centro-periferia, que se manifiesta en una insensibilidad territorial o paradigma centralista de las políticas públicas en Chile, que con independencia de la orientación política del gobierno (democrática o autoritaria) o la preeminencia de la planificación estatal o del mercado como regulador del sistema, ha tendido a respuestas homogéneas y centralistas para enfrentar realidades y necesidades territoriales diversas."

In order to obtain evidences of the contributions of the programs ""EduCAT 1x1"" and ""EduCAT 2.0"" (the realization in Catalonia, of the ""Escuela 2.0"" program) have been explored and analyzed the teaching practices organized in classroom contexts using models 1 to 1 (1 student 1 computer) throughout the year 2011-12. From the field work, that was carried out in 4 schools in this autonomous community, 3 secondary schools (2 public, 1 semiprivate) and 1 public primary school, we developed 8 cases studies (two cases per center). The ultimate aim of this work was to obtain evidence and interpret the practices associated with the 1x1 models (what does it say and what is their contribution), redefining them, putting them in relation and establishing links to other future research. The results of this research have been organized around: (1) pedagogical appropriation of ICTs as a condition for sustainable innovation; (2) ICT as an enabler for access, organization and the representation of information; (3) the digital books, the on-line recourses and the virtual environment as a carrier of the different proposal of learning; (4) the improve of the process of communication; and (5) the influence of the processes of teacher training in the pedagogical practices in the framework of the 1x1 environments."

In recent decades, Chile’s educational reforms aimed at performance have led to a market-oriented funding and management system, worsening social inequality and segregation. Purpose: The study looked at biology literacy and science attitudes in Chilean secondary school students, considering two aims: 1) to analyse the level of scientific literacy in biology and attitudes toward science posed by secondary school students, making comparisons by gender, age, socio-economic status (SES), and type of school; and 2) to evaluate the relationship between scientific literacy in biology and attitudes towards science. Sample: 612 secondary school students in a central southern region of Chile, took part in the study. Design & Methods: A quantitative method was used to analyse the students’ responses on two validated and adapted instruments; A test to measure biological knowledge (TOSLS) and Likert Scale Science-related (LSSr) to measure attitude towards science. These instruments were administered to secondary students, and descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted. Results: The adapted TOSLS showed significant differences in SES, school type and slight variations by gender and age, although, no illiteracy level in biology was found among the Chilean students. The adapted LSSr showed significant differences concerning attitudes toward science were found in school type, and variations by SES and age, and gender. Also, the correlation analysis shows a weak positive relationship between scientific literacy in biology and attitudes towards science, although of moderate magnitude. Conclusion: This study found that scientific literacy in biology does not necessarily impact attitudes towards science. However, SES and type of school can affect understanding and views of science and its role in society, which aligns with previous findings on social inequality in Chilean education."

A study involving 21 secondary biology teachers in Chile explored their perceptions of scientific literacy programs. Teachers from both private and state schools acknowledged the importance of these programs in enhancing scientific literacy. However, disparities in socio-economic status and school types affected the effectiveness of teaching practices, highlighting inequalities in training and resources. The findings underscore the impact of socio-economic factors and school segregation on teachers’ ability to foster scientific literacy in their classrooms."

The Centre for Industry Education Collaboration at the University of York has run the Children Challenging Industry programme (CCI) since 1996. The CCI consists of components designed to place curriculum science in a real-world context, aiming to improve knowledge about and attitudes towards STEM-focused industry, pupils’ STEM career aspirations and attitudes towards science. Professional development for teachers and training for industry partners are also important elements of the CCI, but they are not the focus here. In this evaluative study, 508 children aged 9-11 from 23 English primary schools in two UK areas, completed pre- and post-intervention online questionnaires in the academic year 2019-2020 to gather quantitative and qualitative data on their perceptions. The quantitative data were compared across different groups and time points, and qualitative data was explored thematically. The data suggest that the CCI generally positively increased children's experiences of science learning, particularly where baseline awareness of industry was low. The outcomes showed that the positive impact of the CCI on attitudes towards science, and knowledge of industry, including STEM careers in industry, was statistically significant."

The aims were 1) to identify how spatial issues are incorporated in social work curriculums in Chile and 2) to compare how this incorporation is made in social work programmes in different higher education institutions. The method was a quantitative and descriptive analysis of the curricula of the totality of the programmes in the country (N = 45). We defined 11 concepts to search: community, spatial concepts (territory, environment, place, space), spatial phenomena (city, rural, housing), and social concepts associated with spatial issues (networks, poverty, citizenship). The results show that community is the most relevant concept. Nevertheless, when viewed collectively, spatial concepts hold similar significance. However, there are noticeable differences in how different higher education institutions use spatial concepts. Professional institutes often overlook spatial concerns compared to universities. We recommend regulating social work education to incorporate a minimum curriculum that addresses these issues. Further research is needed to evaluate course content, references, and scientific publications in Chilean social work."

From the question, How has forgiveness been configured based on literary genres within the internal armed conflict in Colombia (1948-2016)? These pages gather findings based on the journalistic chronicle as a literary expression. For its approach, a qualitative methodological design was used, with a hermeneutical historical approach and documentary research, from which it is initially passed through a reflection on the narration of violence, then gives way to a reflexive construction of forgiveness, and finally, narratives are apprehended about him that have been recorded in the different columns of the journalistic chronicle with the purpose of understanding the configurations that he has had through this literary genre."

In addition to analyzing the presentation and voting of norms related to the Afro-descendant Tribal People, we focus on the speeches of members of the Constitutional Convention regarding those norms. Through a critical discourse analysis, we identify three discursive axes that have framed the support or rejection of initiatives regarding the recognition of Afro-descendants related to the meaning of the legal category ""tribal people"", to the question of preexistence, and to Afrodescendants' ""foreignization.""The article concludes with a discussion of the positions adopted by different sectors of the convention, identifying some imaginaries that entailed limits for the inclusion of the Afro-Chilean people in the constitutional proposal."

The question of the study is: In what way do the activities in the SEAqs designed by PCFI students promote modeling? Based on the legitimation code theory and the perspective of the school scientific activity, a theoretical-methodological tool of a semantic and cognitive nature is proposed for the characterization of 20 SEAqs through content analysis. The conclusions point to the difficulties that PCFI students have when designing SEAqs that promote modeling, as well as to the value of the theoretical-methodological tool which was used to illuminate these difficulties for the teaching of both chemistry and science in general."

A Service-Learning Experience Based on Inquiry | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Raising awareness about the environment through developing critical thinking is essential in a world marked by the complexity of social problems and the need for sustainability. Given the importance of its promotion in teaching–learning, this chapter presents a service-learning experience grounded in inquiry-based learning, focused on Sustainable Development Goal 12, which addresses responsible production and consumption. The chapter delves into the dimension of critical thinking related to the comprehensive analysis of problems, using the example of a latent environmental issue resulting from industrial activity in Chile’s central area. This issue was investigated by 19 Chilean students, aged 15, who visited the polluted area, conducted research and reflected on their findings. The students then shared their research results with their community via social networks. The findings from this experience reveal that students predominantly considered the environmental aspects of the problem, often overlooking its social, economic, political, and ethical dimensions. These findings underscore the need to continue providing students with opportunities to work on the comprehensive analysis of problems, engaging in the holistic analysis of complex issues."

This fact was reflected in the economic surplus created by the taxation on saltpetre’s exportation, which led to one of the more prosperous times in the history of Chile. In fact it created an increment of 800 per cent of the treasury funds a few years after its imposition and was followed by the abolishment of all direct taxation methods in 1891. This circumstance continued for 20 years, after which direct taxation needed to be reintroduced and was followed by the establishment of income taxation in order to cope with the public expenditure. Fast forward to the present-day economic situation of the country, Chile is currently the biggest producer of copper in the world, producing over one third of the world’s total production. Copper accounts for roughly 20 per cent of Chile’s gross domestic product and 60 of its exports, having a strategic relevance for the treasury of the country. However, the future of the mineral’s possibility to provide wealth is uncertain, mostly because of the decline of its demand by the global market, but also because of the increasing costs of extracting it. This is not the first time that Chile has encountered a situation like this, but it still has not created a system to defend its economy from the dependency on commodities. This paper analyses the relationship between the mineral cycles present in Chilean history and the taxation system present in the country, in order to apply it to the latest mineral cycle; lithium."

Little is known about A-PsyCap profiles and their relationship with desirable academic outcomes. This study aims to identify A-PsyCap profiles among Chilean undergraduate students and explore the relationship between A-PsyCap and Coping with Academic Stress and Time Management. A sample of 102 Chilean undergraduate students was considered to achieve these research objectives. A cluster analysis identified four A-PsyCap profiles. The Optimal Profile (P1) scores highest on all four psychological resources; the complementary profile (P2) shows average scores on all four psychological resources; the functional profile (P3) has medium efficacy scores and low scores in hope, resilience, and optimism; and the latent profile (P4) has lower scores on all four psychological resources.. The results explain that these A-PsyCap profiles relate differently to Coping with Academic Stress and Time Management. Additionally, constraints and possibilities for further research are explained."

By showing how state officials hired under flexible fixed-term contracts deal with documents and signatures, I challenge the notion of the indifferent bureaucrat. Rather than portraying state officials as disinterested or indifferent, I illustrate how those in unstable job positions depend on generating an official paper trail to secure ongoing employment.

Based on data obtained after a year of ethnographic fieldwork, this article describes how these technologies, activated through contingent practices and stabilized retrospectively, are used for the movement of resources and as tools to overcome the obstacles posed by a public administration model that It operates through management mechanisms such as labor flexibility, performance evaluation, accountability and competition for resources. Thus, it seeks to reveal the local and contingent circumstances that participate in the stabilization of budgets freed from the conditions involved in their production, and the discretionary tools that officials use to capture and allocate resources."

The method employed was a systematic literature review that contemplates an analysis of empirical research conducted between 2013 and 2022. Databases such as Scopus, Scielo, and Web of Science were consulted, considering both inclusion and exclusion criteria to retrieve the maximum amount of available information. The predesigned search strategy yielded 23 articles for analysis. The results show that the main practices involve the use of scientific questions and classroom workshops, and that most of these investigations occur in North America and Europe. The most significant findings on contemporary visions of science that incorporate the gender perspective. This research describes the challenges related to the methodologies implemented to encourage educational practices from the perspective of equity and plurality in science education, geographical scope and the visions of science and gender present in the studies. Therefore, it is intended to be of value to science teachers and the science education research community interested in the inclusion of the gender perspective in teaching."
2775,10,"TITLE: From the Street to the Courtroom: The Material Bridge Between Law and Everyday Life | KEYWORDS: Chile; courts; domestic violence; legal consciousness; materiality | ABSTRACT: Legal consciousness studies have demonstrated that law manifests in diverse forms and spaces beyond formal institutions, permeating the everyday lives of individuals. However, this growing body of work often overlooks the role of objects and non-human agents in shaping legal experiences. Adopting a micro-sociological perspective, this article bridges legal consciousness and material culture studies by examining how objects mediate the process of problematization—understanding everyday life through the lens of law. Drawing on a judicial ethnography conducted in 2017 in Chilean family courts processing domestic violence cases, we analyze three seemingly mundane objects: a legal text kiosk near the courthouse, televisions broadcasting institutional videos, and magazines in the waiting area adjacent to the courtroom. These objects mark the transition from public to legal spaces and forge connections between everyday life and legality. Our findings reveal that materiality underpins the emergence of legal power, transforming domestic violence into a legal dispute while preserving unproblematic aspects of daily life."

This research explores the role of these reports as ‘legal technicalities’, serving as both products and catalysts of specific social relations and tensions, and reveals an earnest yet unsuccessful effort to establish judicial authority amid poorly conceived DV reform. The article contributes to an empirical, bottom-up analysis of authority construction techniques used in recent widespread judicial reforms in Chile, providing fresh insights into the complexities of institutional changes within these contexts."
2777,22,"TITLE: Legal Consciousness and Judicial Authority: Risk and Gender Inequalities in Domestic Violence Procedures in Chile Conciencia jurídica y autoridad judicial: riesgo y desigualdades de género en procedimientos por violencia intrafamiliar (VIF) en Chile | KEYWORDS: domestic violence; gender; judicial authority; legal consciousness; legal ethnography; risk | ABSTRACT: Domestic violence is a relevant problem about gender; this is manifested, for example, in the creation of long-standing international and national legal institutions to control this problem. However, given the structural nature of this violence and its relationship with patriarchal schemes rooted in society, it is difficult for the mediation of law by itself to result in the total fulfillment of this commitment. This work contributes to a novel and situated understanding of the intervention of legality in gender-based violence in the domestic sphere. The novelty lies in visualizing the notion of legal consciousness as an analytical framework, i.e., how legality sustains its power despite constant failure to fulfill its promises. The ethnographic method was applied to two family courts to discuss this issue. The fieldwork reveals that family courts use the notion of risk to provide preventive measures, which allows intervention in the life experiences of complainants. This is how the promise of control of this type of gender-based violence that is made through law is transformed into action."

Given this context, it is important to assess whether the community’s expectations align with this goal. This article presents findings from a qualitative study conducted in the Nahuelbuta and Costa Araucanía areas, revealing that community leaders and municipal officials view the university primarily as a teaching institution, while municipal managers expect it to contribute research-based solutions to local challenges. From a network governance perspective, it is recommended to develop an “interface” of university-community relations, enabling the expansion of the actors’ mental models regarding the university and the generation of collaborative processes for identifying community needs."

It is intended to show that there is a situation of invisibility and marginalization based on the sex-generic axis that has structural bases and that perpetuate until the present, adopting different modalities and actors. The discussion begins by situating it in the expanded context of Latin America to narrow it down to the specific context of the Chilean literary field. In the last part of this essay, an overview is presented on the controversy that arises in 2019 in the sphere of Chilean feminist literary criticism. This section reflects on topics such as the relationship between writers and the editorial world, authorship constructions, and sorority. It reveals the depth of androcentric paradigms of reading and valuation that continue to demand a certain “morality” and correctness in the construction of the author's figure."

The mill’s advantages to building the Hispano-Creole society are investigated. In the analysis of the particular use of mill technology by the indigenous people, we found that it was used to improve their living conditions, which triggered an adoption in Spanish technology and food and economic structures, which generated an impact because not only coercive ways were used so that the original peoples accepted and assimilated the monarchical power, but there was an interest from indigenous to the new technologies Spanish was installing in the territory."

For the Spanish empire, the main focus is on the trans-Pampean route of the Southern Cone of America (Buenos Aires-Mendoza), the Quito-Cuenca-Guayaquil triangle, and the roads of the New Kingdom of Granada, with its connections with Panama and El Callao. For Brazil, the mill on the São Paulo-Santos route is highlighted. It is concluded that the mills contributed to promoting the regional flour trade and, by improving the supply of transporters in ports, inns, and “tambos, ” they consolidated long-distance trade routes and the exchange of typical regional products."

Theoretical Framework: The theoretical framework is associated with the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Chilean science curricular bases, as well as the didactic management associated with school textbooks. Method: The mixed method is followed, through content analysis, the elaboration of a priori categories, supported by quantitative elements to describe and interpret the data obtained from the analysis of school textbooks. Results and Discussion: The results obtained revealed the presence of activities, still insufficient, that deal with the topic of water in the texts. The highest frequencies of educational activities are found in the fifth and sixth grades. The skills promoted are intellectual capacities (operations to acquire, recover, solve problems and retain different types of knowledge); on the other hand, the skills that demand a process of practice (mastery of the technique or skill), attitudes and habits, such as ways of acting and behaving, are the least promoted. Research Implications: The implications of the study are referred to the methodology of science teaching in Basic Education and the respective teacher training. Originality/value: The results of the study contribute to filling a gap in the literature related to the teaching of water proposed in school textbooks. With this, guidelines are provided to improve the activities suggested in the textbooks, promoting awareness of water, its reuse and conservation."

An instrumental case study is designed where university students solve arithmetic and algebraic problems. Implicative statistics are applied to conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses of student answers. The results show that students use algebraic and arithmetic techniques without mentioning properties of an algebraic structure. In solving non-routine problems, school mathematics techniques are favored and little use is made of properties and concepts associated with a binary operation, typical of university-level mathematics. In conclusion, there should be an implementation of regular instances to promote solving non-routine problems by considering other mathematical domains such as algebra, geometry, and arithmetic."
2791,21,"TITLE: Claims of ownership, claims of dignity: Moral narratives on the right to housing in Chile’s constitutional referendum | KEYWORDS: Chile; constitutional referendum; homeownership; moral economy; narratives; rights | ABSTRACT: In September 2022, Chileans overwhelmingly rejected the draft of a new constitution to replace the inherited from Pinochet’s dictatorship. Existing explanations attribute the failure to a mixture of ill-designed procedures, political dynamics, and ideological distortions and fake news. However, we argue for a different interpretation, emphasizing the collision of normative worlds in the struggle for demarcating rights. Through narrative analysis of social media stories during the referendum campaign, we investigate distinct moral economies around the constitutional debate on housing rights. These reveal a tension between divergent rights claims anchored in the value of “ownership” versus “dignity.” Within these almost irreconcilable normative universes, private property condenses meanings across narratives: the value of personal home-ownership effort and the collective aspiration for decent housing access. While not inherently incompatible, these narratives evolved into polarizing channels through which property became the defining moral boundary that underlies the stories shaping Chile’s constitutional struggle over rights."

This also happens in foreign language learning as improving proficiency is challenging for students and self-regulation has proven effective in different educational levels. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was designed with a treatment and a control group, and pre- and post-test for 70 undergraduate students majoring in English as a foreign language at a Chilean university. A 10-week intervention was conducted to develop self-regulation during emergency remote teaching. Results: Findings revealed that the intervention, as implemented in the study, was successful in improving self-regulated learning, and in participants’ recognizing the practical utility of tools acquired. On the other hand, while the level of engagement remained similar after the intervention, this was seen as a protective effect of the teaching-learning strategy on motivational states. Discussion: This research underscores the importance of self-regulated learning training in higher education to allow for students’ autonomy and agency, as well as connectedness with instructors and peers, especially during the harsh teaching conditions of sanitary confinement."

In this context, this research aims to identify the urban transformation processes involving high-rise densification around a heritage space with dual protection: Historical Monument and Typical Zone of the Civic Quarter, such as the case of the Basilica of the Sacramentinos in the commune of Santiago, Chile. Employing a mixed methodology, the repopulation plan, evolution, and displacement of real estate supply, building permits, land value, and analysis of state and municipal heritage regulations were analyzed. The results show how the neighborhood surrounding the Basilica has been transformed, the regulatory benefits of the Municipal Regulatory Plan, and the physical obsolescence affecting the property, which has contributed to a loss in its heritage value, leaving it as a pathological element segregated from the current urban fabric. Finally, based on the findings, recommendations are proposed for the coexistence of new urban processes and heritage buildings."

Resistencias y perspectivas desde una revisión sistemática de la literatura científica | KEYWORDS: Democratization; Feminism; Gender Equality; Higher Education; Institutionalization; Resistance to Change; Social Change | ABSTRACT: The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent scientific literature on the development of institutional mechanisms for gender equality in higher education, focusing on obstacles and resistances from a feminist institutional change perspective. The PRISMA-ScR method was used to review and select literature published between 2019 and 2023, available in Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The selected articles were analyzed through thematic content analysis, identifying eight key themes: gender equality policies, institutional change, resistance to change, interpretive frameworks, masculine academic culture, policy frameworks, gender mainstreaming, and gender actors. The results indicate that despite the implementation of equality policies and plans, institutional and cultural resistances persist, limiting their effectiveness. These resistances are associated with an androcentric academic culture, limited resources, and insufficient institutional support. Additionally, equality policies are often implemented under efficiency and competitiveness frameworks, reducing their transformative potential. The effectiveness of gender mainstreaming in higher education depends on institutional commitment and recognition of gender as a key dimension of organizational norms. The review concludes that equality policies are necessary but insufficient without sustained commitment and effective monitoring to ensure meaningful, sustainable changes. It emphasizes the importance of addressing gender change in higher education as cultural change, providing insights for future interventions."

Cinema is a powerful educational tool capable of enriching the teaching-learning process by incorporating visual and narrative elements. Methodology: A systematic review of cinema from a didactic perspective and the discourses explaining its knowledge and representations is conducted to identify its didactic contributions. The PRISMA methodology is used, ensuring a literature review that considers several dimensions selected based on the objectives. Results: The collected information shows that cinema facilitates the understanding of complex concepts and fosters critical thinking. However, its integration into the curriculum requires careful planning and specific teacher training. Discussion: Benefits and best practices in the implementation of cinema in educational contexts are identified, highlighting the visibility and pedagogical need to systematize the knowledge that cinema provides in learning processes. Conclusions: Cinema in the classroom requires a systematization that adds value to facilitate the understanding of complex issues that cinema could provide."

Trends that are relevant considering the limited development of social assistance policies in the region during much of the 20th century, creating favorable conditions for the incorporation of groups historically excluded from social protection systems. In this context, the article identifies significant increases in access and coverage when analyzing the percentages of the population receiving different types of cash transfers and, in turn, the contribution of these benefits to reduce poverty gaps, which is particularly significant in the case of the population living in extreme poverty. However, when evaluation the scope and critical points of these social protection expansion processes in terms of the quality of the social inclusion processes, divergent results can be observed. On the one hand, progress is being made in terms of institutionalization and formalization of the region’s welfare architectures, particularly the supply of social assistance. On the other hand, access to social protection is segmented by factors such as class, socio-economic stratum, labor status and gender, which implies conditions of incorporation and receipt of social benefits that are differentiated in quantity and quality."

Design/methodology/approach: This research adopted a qualitative approach, drawing on data collected through 26 semi-structured interviews, the revision of 4 policy documents and 15 promotional videos. The data were analysed thematically, adopting the cultural political economy framework as a lens to guide the analysis. Findings: Findings show that the problematisation of TVET’s perceived value is rooted in the system’s development history and cultural ideas. A communication campaign was one of the means to address this problem. Initial campaign messages appealed to the benefits prospective students could enjoy because of choosing TVET programs. However, later, the message gradually shifted to highlighting the collective benefits for the country, depicting TVET as a fulfilling and valuable education path. Originality/value: This article is the first to critically analyse the reasons for and use of a communication campaign to enhance the TVET’s perceived value in a global south context."

The reliability and validity were assessed through a pilot study conducted with a population of students with intellectual disabilities (ID). The linguistic adaptation was executed according to expert judgments of each indicator: adequacy, coherence, relevance, and clarity. After the scale adaptation, a scale pilot was conducted to explore its technical properties. It was performed in a public school for students with ID. The validity coefficient result was 0.998, while the complete reliability result was α = 0.978. For the reliability subscales, the results were the following: autonomy α = 0.941, self-initiation α = 0.925, self-direction α = 0.970, self-regulation α = 0.804, and self-concept α = 0.935. The results confirm the AUTODDIS scale as a valid and reliable instrument to evaluate self-determination. However, it is necessary to apply this scale to a larger number of students with ID to generalize these results."

This emerging reality has had a profound impact on Chilean society, particularly within public schools where educators have not been adequately prepared to navigate an intercultural environment. As a response to this reality, two distinct strands of literature have emerged in this field: one highlighting the challenges faced by elementary teachers with immigrant students and addressing issues of racism and classism in their classrooms; the other, documenting exemplary practices employed by teachers to establish trustful relationships with their international migrant students. This research endeavors to enhance our understanding of teachers' motivations and practices addressing inequities for immigrant students, with a secondary goal of initiating a dialogue about classism and racism in Chile. Employing a hybrid qualitative methodology that combines case study and grounded theory, this study offers a detailed exploration of the motivations, practices, and representations of Chilean elementary teachers working with international migrant students. The findings concerning Chilean teachers' motivations reveal a powerful sense of empathy towards the life context of their immigrant students and a vocational commitment to teaching. Their efforts focus on the academic domain and extending beyond the school setting through visits to students and their families. Teachers' representations reflect the nuanced nature of racism in Chile, with some educators acknowledging its existence while others vehemently deny it. Additionally, teachers advocate for the development of welcoming protocols and increased government-school support for their new multicultural classrooms. Lastly, the unique characteristics of this group of elementary teachers are presented, emphasizing the necessity for their engagement with critical theories and a profound reflection on significant practices aimed at promoting social justice."

Being precariousness a multi-causal social phenomenon, crossed by factors such as poverty, migration, different types of discrimination and intersections, the proposal made here is that labor law can be, among other causes, an explanatory factor of labor precariousness in formal labor relations, in economic and social contexts in which access to basic goods is not ensured by the State. Pointing out to this purpose, a theoretical proposal is developed which, taking certain categories of analysis from legal studies of national and comparative literature, as well as from sociology, systematizes the elements that make up labor precariousness, finally outlining a concept of precariousness which in turn can serve for a critical examination of labor institutionality."
2803,21,"TITLE: The Chilean Constitutional Process Narrated Through a Spiral | KEYWORDS: Chilean constitutional process; decoloniality; Indigenous peoples; social and environmental justice | ABSTRACT: Building on an intertwined spatiotemporal weaving of reckoning-repairing-reworlding, this article analyses the constitutional process experienced in Chile between 2019-2023. Inspired by the sociology of image as a methodological tool and following a narrative that takes the shape of a spiral, we examine a series of photographs representing different layers in this ongoing process. In October 2019, the largest demonstrations in Chile's history sparked long-brewing demands for social and ecological transformation. The unsustainable pressure pushed political parties to call for a constitutional referendum where the population overwhelmingly voted to overturn the charter inherited from Augusto Pinochet's regime, and so the process of drafting a new text began. Following the rejection of two drafts, the constitutional process is, for now, closed. Yet, we claim that embracing a failure narrative is not only futile, but misleading, and we propose to see these events in terms of their potential for conceptualising and enacting transformative futures. Drawing on decolonial, anticolonial, and Indigenous scholarship, this essay focuses mainly on 2019's uprising and the first constitutional process (2021-2022) examining demands for Indigenous transformation – and the possibilities this case offers resistance movements elsewhere and “elsewhen.”"

It begins with a review of the state of the art, analyzing how feminist movements in Chile have developed strategies of resistance and transformation from the civic-military dictatorship to the present, articulating demands that go beyond gender issues to include critiques of the neoliberal model. The central objective is to explore how Chilean feminism resignifies emotions traditionally seen as paralyzing or destructive, transforming them into political tools that unite communities and strengthen mobilizations. It argues that these emotions do not operate solely on an individual level but intertwine to build resilient collectivities and generate demands for social justice. Through the analysis of emblematic performances such as “Un violador en tu camino” and other feminist performances, the article evaluates how the body and affects emerge in the public space as elements of political transformation."

However, universal principles for ICT integration need to better align with the local realities of teachers and schools for optimal uptake. Using Chile and Finland as case studies, this research summarizes, appraises, and synthesizes literature on teachers’ ICT uses before and during the pandemic. Adopting a ‘glocal’ framework (Manca et al., 2021), the study identifies local and global trends in ICT uses, including potential research shifts that carry implications for both theory and practice. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine Finnish and Chilean teachers’ ICT uses as reported in studies across five databases. The search was limited to peer-reviewed, English-language publications over a thirteen-year period and yielded 26 high-quality papers that were analyzed using meta-aggregation. Findings reveal that the reported ICT uses depended on the research methods employed to study these where qualitative studies documented innovative uses and quantitative studies more traditional uses of ICT. During the pandemic, research shifted to focus more on teacher experiences with Finnish studies highlighting positive ICT-related experiences and Chilean studies negative experiences including teachers’ lack of training and practical issues. Based on the findings, recommendations are given to continue to enhance ICT integration both locally and globally."

The commune is a sacrificial zone marked by the high presence of extractive mining companies. The notion of sacrifice, worked theoretically from different authors, gi-ves rise to the analysis of the sacrificial practices to which women resort to face the effects of sacrifice in their lives daily. In this way, qualitative research is proposed, with a narrative and exploratory approach, carried out through a case study. Based on semi-structured narrative interviews, we inquired into the sacrificial practices developed by the participants of the study. The sample consisted of women, participants of social groups and organizations. The results revealed a series of sacrificial practices, in addition to the habituation and normalization of environmental sacrifice, as well as possibilities of resistance."

It summarizes the antecedents that led to the adoption of this test (PSU) in the early 2000s, aligning it to the secondary education curriculum. After indicating its main intended uses, we identify the most relevant forms of evidence for a test that primarily serves admission purposes. Results show that the tests have adequate reliability and that at least two of them (mathematics and science) have good predictive validity evidence when considering both academic performance and student's persistence in tertiary education. The chapter concludes by identifying challenges for the future admission system that will be established based on the recent Higher Education Law in Chile, which, among other changes, transfers the admission system to the Ministry of Education."

Inspired by international standards on educational measurement and evaluation, this book illustrates efforts that have been made in several countries to validate different types of educational assessments, including student learning assessments, measurements of non-cognitive aspects in students, teacher evaluations, and tests for certification and selection. It gathers the experience of validity studies from the main international assessments in Latin America (PISA, TIMSS, ERCE, and ICCS). Additionally, it shows the challenges that must be taken into account when evaluations are used to compare countries, groups or trends of achievement over time. The book builds on the premise that measurements in the educational field should not be used if there are no studies that support the validity of the interpretation of their scores, or the use made of such tests. It shows that, despite the recognition given to validity, relatively few educational measurement assessments have accumulated enough evidence to support their interpretation and use. In doing so, this volume increases awareness about the relevance of validity, especially when assessments are key component of educational policies."
2814,0,"TITLE: Introduction | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Educational assessments have had a strong development in Latin America in recent years. Almost all countries in the region regularly assess their students' achievement. Several also do so for selection purposes-for example, access to higher education. It is also increasingly common the development of assessments that address teacher performance. Moreover, international assessments have shown great impact, which has led to a sustained increase in the number of countries in the region that participate in and use PISA, TIMMS and ERCE results. The results of these assessments, in addition to the direct use assigned to them according to the declared purposes (training, diagnosis, selection, certification and promotion), conform a fundamental antecedent for judging the state of progress of education systems, as well as for making comparisons between groups (for example, men versus women, and socioeconomic and regional groups), and for estimating trends in educational achievement over time. As a result, assessments have become central tools for educational policy, and strongly influence opinions that the elite and citizens have about the educational system."

The study conducted a factor invariance analysis of six background questionnaires of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) 2011 fourth-grade. The intrinsic motivation scales in mathematics and science were noted to exhibit a higher degree of cross-cultural equivalence, while the self-beliefs scale shows no degree of invariance. These results suggest that the motivation scale is the only one sufficiently invariant for making valid comparisons across countries. Different factors that could affect the cross-cultural invariance are addressed."
2816,0,"TITLE: Evaluating the quality of teaching: can there be valid differentiation in the middle of the performance distribution? | KEYWORDS: classroom observation; teacher evaluation; Teaching quality; validity | ABSTRACT: An important challenge in evaluating the quality of teaching is to arrive at valid distinctions between teachers, particularly in the middle of the performance distribution. This study addressed this issue for the Chilean national teacher evaluation system. Mathematics teachers (N = 51) from the 2 middle adjacent performance categories, and their students, were examined by videotaping classroom practice and coding the videos with the Classroom Assessment Scoring System for Secondary School, measuring students’ perceptions of their teachers’ practices and assessing student learning on standardized grade-level and unit-specific tests. Findings show that on almost all criterion variables, competent teachers outperformed basic teachers, but differences were usually small. Teachers evaluated as competent obtained consistently better results regarding their teaching practices, as assessed by trained observers, as well as based on reports by their own students. However, there was only weak indication of differences between the 2 groups in terms of student learning."

Results showed that religiosity was consistently related to right and conservative ideologies in all countries, except Australia. This relation held across different religions, and did not vary across participant’s demographic conditions (i.e., gender, age, income, and education). After controlling for basic personal values, the contribution of religiosity on ideology was still significant. However, the effect was substantial only in countries where religion has played a prominent role in the public sphere, such as Spain, Poland, Greece, Italy, Slovakia, and Turkey. In the other countries, the unique contribution of religiosity was marginal or small."
2818,0,"TITLE: Basic Values, Ideological Self-Placement, and Voting: A Cross-Cultural Study | KEYWORDS: basic values; ideology; left–right; political orientation; voting | ABSTRACT: The current study examines the contribution of left–right (or liberal–conservative) ideology to voting, as well as the extent to which basic values account for ideological orientation. Analyses were conducted in 16 countries from five continents (Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Oceania), most of which have been neglected by previous studies. Results showed that left–right (or liberal–conservative) ideology predicted voting in all countries except Ukraine. Basic values exerted a considerable effect in predicting ideology in most countries, especially in established democracies such as Australia, Finland, Italy, United Kingdom, and Germany. Pattern of relations with the whole set of 10 values revealed that the critical trade-off underlying ideology is between values concerned with tolerance and protection for the welfare of all people (universalism) versus values concerned with preserving the social order and status quo (security). A noteworthy exception was found in European postcommunist countries, where relations of values with ideology were small (Poland) or near to zero (Ukraine, Slovakia)."
2819,0,"TITLE: Teacher performance and student learning: linking evidence from two national assessment programmes | KEYWORDS: Chile; Latin America; performance assessment; teacher evaluation; validity; value-added methodology | ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the validity of a national, standards-based teacher evaluation programme by examining the relationship between teachers’ evaluation results and their students’ learning progress. We used census achievement data that assessed the same cohort of students at the end of 8th and 10th grade. We applied multilevel modelling and calculated correlations between teachers’ value-added estimates and their results based on the evaluation system’s multiple measures of teaching quality, which include a portfolio of classroom teaching artefacts and a video-taped lesson, a peer interview, supervisor assessments and a self-assessment. Our study finds a medium-size positive relationship between value-added estimates in mathematics and teachers’ portfolio results, while relationships with the other instruments are weaker. Correlations are lower for Spanish, but showing a similar pattern across instruments. We also find significant yet weak relationships between value-added estimates and three of six emerging factors of teaching practice based on the evaluation’s portfolio data."

What might be the source of coherence? We view political values as expressions, in the political domain, of more basic personal values. Basic personal values (e.g., security, achievement, benevolence, hedonism) are organized on a circular continuum that reflects their conflicting and compatible motivations. We theorize that this circular motivational structure also gives coherence to political values. We assess this theorizing with data from 15 countries, using eight core political values (e.g., free enterprise, law and order) and ten basic personal values. We specify the underlying basic values expected to promote or oppose each political value. We offer different hypotheses for the 12 non-communist and three post-communist countries studied, where the political context suggests different meanings of a basic or political value. Correlation and regression analyses support almost all hypotheses. Moreover, basic values account for substantially more variance in political values than age, gender, education, and income. Multidimensional scaling analyses demonstrate graphically how the circular motivational continuum of basic personal values structures relations among core political values. This study strengthens the assumption that individual differences in basic personal values play a critical role in political thought."

The focus is on intended and unintended consequences at the municipal (local) level where the evaluation results are supposed to inform educational policies related to hiring and firing, professional development and recognition. Consequences were examined by conducting interviews with nineteen local education authorities in ten municipalities. Results indicate that the program has achieved partially most of its intended goals, mainly the provision of local reward mechanisms for high-achieving teachers, the support of teachers with shortcomings, the use of evaluation results for local educational decision-making and creating a basis for peer-to-peer collaboration. Important unintended consequences were observed such as questioning of NTES' legitimacy and the resistance of teachers to participate in the evaluation."

We interviewed 57 school leaders in 30 schools across 10 municipalities about effects and uses of the assessment in their schools. Results show that in the large majority of schools our interviewees observe positive effects such as increased teamwork and internal reflection processes based on the assessment results. Reports about effects at teacher level far outnumber institutional effects, and are mixed. In all schools our interviewees report on teachers' negative emotions and work overload due to the assessment process, but also about their internalization of the underlying professional standards. The paper analyzes differences among schools and offers suggestions for the development of large-scale standardized teacher evaluation systems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
2825,0,"TITLE: Consequential validity of the teaching excellence certification program in Chile Validez consecuencial del programa de asignación de excelencia pedagógica en Chile | KEYWORDS: Consequential validity; Teacher competency testing; Teacher evaluation; Teaching excellence certification | ABSTRACT: The goal of this qualitative study was to assess the consequences of the ""Excellence in Teaching Program"", open for teachers of both public and private-subsidized schools since 2002. We interviewed N = 60 school leaders from N = 30 schools; conducted N = 5 focus groups with 35 certified teachers; and interviewed 10 teachers who failed in their application. The main results show that accredited teachers have strengthened their professional self-esteem, and they welcome the monetary incentive; although the burocratic obstacles to receive it lower its value. Social recognition happens more from external sources than the local school community. This could also explain why AEP-certified teachers' best practices do not get disseminated within the local school community. Certified teachers are not seen as a human resource of value for the pedagogical management of the school. Within the conclusions we discuss some of the findings and make recommendations to further the intended program purposes."
2826,-1,"TITLE: Trust in political institutions in Chile: A model of the main components of trust judgments Confianza en instituciones políticas en Chile: Un modelo de los componentes centrales de juicios de confianza | KEYWORDS: Benevolence; Capacity; Chile; Political institutions; Trust | ABSTRACT: Citizen's trust in political institutions is important for democracies. However, there are doubts regarding the nature of trust judgments. We argue that trust judgments concerning political institutions centrally involve the consideration of both the preparation and resources of the institutions that enable it to fulfill its goals (capacity), and the orientation of such goals toward the wellbeing of citizens (benevolence). Results are based on a survey carried out in Santiago, Chile, during 2005 on 996 people. We conclude that both capacity and benevolence are strong predictors of trust and that, beyond the direct influence of each of them, they also have a joint effect on trust judgments."
2827,-1,"TITLE: Forgiveness and reparation in Chile: The role of cognitive and emotional intergroup antecedents | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: In this study our focus was on forgiveness and reparation as 2 major manifestations of the Chilean political reconciliation processes initiated after the recovery of democracy in 1990. Beyond the conceptual differences between forgiveness and reparation, this study analyzes the differential relations they have with important cognitive (victimization, demand for outgroup remorse, and demand for truth) and emotional (anger, collective guilt, and shame) variables involved in the reconciliation process. Respondents were university students who identified with the 2 major political groups originally involved in the conflict (N right wing = 225; N left wing = 264). Overall, results confirmed that forgiveness and reparation were positively correlated only in the case of the group associated with perpetrating political repression. Forgiveness was predicted mainly by the emotional factors (collective anger and guilt) whereas reparation was predicted by a combination of cognitive and emotional factors.

2828,0,"TITLE: Beliefs, Value Orientation, and Culture in Attribution Processes and Helping Behavior | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Two experiments were conducted to investigate: (a) the influence of the “subjugation control over nature” value orientation, a dimension of cultural variation, on attribution processes; and (b) the effect of activation of beliefs associated with this value orientation on attribution processes and helping behavior. In Experiment 1, introductory psychology students were classified as either “control” or “subjugation” oriented according to scores obtained from a measure of the value orientation. Results suggest an effect of value orientation on attributions for a behavioral outcome. In Experiment 2, an attribution empathy model of helping behavior was examined in relation to activation of beliefs associated with the “control over nature” value orientation. This model was tested using Bentler's program for the analysis of structural equations. Results show that beliefs interact with empathy to influence helping behavior. Overall, the two studies suggest the importance and feasibility of investigating cultural factors in models of social behavior even when studies are conducted within a single culture. © 1992, Sage Publications.

2829,9,"TITLE: The Chilean socio-ethno-genomic cline | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Studies of the current Chilean population performed using classical genetic markers have established that the Chilean population originated primarily from the admixture of European people, particularly Spaniards, and Amerindians. A socioeconomic-ethno-genetic cline was established soon after the conquest. Spaniards born in Spain or Chile occupied the highest Socioeconomic Strata, while Amerindians belonged to the lowest. The intermediate strata consisted of people with different degrees of ethnic admixture; the larger the European admixture, the higher the Socioeconomic Level. The present study of molecular genomic markers sought to calculate the percentage of Amerindian admixture and revealed a finer distribution of this cline, as well as differences between two Amerindian groups: Aymara and Mapuche. The use of two socioeconomic classifications–Class and Socioeconomic Level–reveals important differences. Furthermore, Self-reported Ethnicity (self-assignment to an ethnic group) and Self-reported Ancestry (self-recognition of Amerindian ancestors) show variations and differing relationships between socioeconomic classifications and genomic Amerindian Admixture. These data constitute a valuable input for the formulation of public healthcare policy and show that the notions of Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Strata and Class should always be a consideration in policy development."

Our study focused on highlighting potential issues with environmental and technological education, offering opportunities to complement the current Chilean curriculum with an interdisciplinary approach. During a five-week period interspersed through the school semester, 115 underprivileged children in seventh grade from five public schools of southern Chile participated in workshops based on Arduino technology to address current environmental problems caused by global change and anthropization. Surveys were conducted to participating students and included both open and closed-ended questions, which measured attitudes and perceptions towards science and the use of technology in classrooms and daily lives. Surveys were analysed quantitatively with basic statistics and qualitatively by building semantic networks of the relationships between different concepts expressed by the students. Results did not show significant changes in attitudes towards science or technology before and after the workshops but students reported mixed feelings about science. Indifference and fear emerged, coupled with the need for more interactive experiences. Curiosity and enthusiasm also surfaced when students were using new technologies. Since the school curriculum is generally focused exclusively towards the completion of specific curricular aims, highly vulnerable schools in Chile have few opportunities to access interactive, hands-on activities. Low-cost, emergent technologies, such Arduinos, have a high potential for improving student's attitude towards science and technology and their use should be considered when tailoring school curriculum in Chile and elsewhere."
