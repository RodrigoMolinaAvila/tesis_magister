Two methods are used to extract the efficiency from tt¯ events, a combinatorial likelihood approach and a tag-and-probe method. A boosted decision tree, not using b-tagging information, is used to select events in which two b-jets are present, which reduces the dominant uncertainty in the modelling of the flavour of the jets. The efficiency is extracted for jets in a transverse momentum range from 20 to 300 GeV, with data-to-simulation scale factors calculated by comparing the efficiency measured using collision data to that predicted by the simulation. The two methods give compatible results, and achieve a similar level of precision, measuring data-to-simulation scale factors close to unity with uncertainties ranging from 2% to 12% depending on the jet transverse momentum.', 'TITLE: Rhizospheric bacteria from the Atacama Desert hyper-arid core: cultured community dynamics and plant growth promotion | KEYWORDS: amplicon sequencing; D. spicata; rhizobiome; S. foliosa; soil cultures | ABSTRACT: The Atacama Desert is the oldest and driest desert on Earth, encompassing great temperature variations, high ultraviolet radiation, drought, and high salinity, making it ideal for studying the limits of life and resistance strategies. It is also known for harboring a great biodiversity of adapted life forms. While desertification is increasing as a result of climate change and human activities, it is necessary to optimize soil and water usage, where stress-resistant crops are possible solutions. As many studies have revealed the great impact of the rhizobiome on plant growth efficiency and resistance to abiotic stress, we set up to explore the rhizospheric soils of Suaeda foliosa and Distichlis spicata desert plants. By culturing these soils and using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we address community taxonomy composition dynamics, stability through time, and the ability to promote lettuce plant growth. The rhizospheric soil communities were dominated by the families Pseudomonadaceae, Bacillaceae, and Planococcaceae for S. foliosa and Porphyromonadaceae and Haloferacaceae for D. spicata. Nonetheless, the cultures were completely dominated by the Enterobacteriaceae family (up to 98%). Effectively, lettuce plants supplemented with the cultures showed greater size and biomass accumulation. We identified 12 candidates that could be responsible for these outcomes, of which 5 (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Paenisporosarcina, and Ammoniphilus) were part of the built co-occurrence network. We aim to contribute to the efforts to characterize the microbial communities as key for the plant’s survival in extreme environments and as a possible source of consortia with plant growth promotion traits aimed at agricultural applications. IMPORTANCE The current scenario of climate change and desertification represents a series of incoming challenges for all living organisms. As the human population grows rapidly, so does the rising demand for food and natural resources; thus, it is necessary to make agriculture more efficient by optimizing soil and water usage, thus ensuring future food supplies. Particularly, the Atacama Desert (northern Chile) is considered the most arid place on Earth as a consequence of geological and climatic characteristics, such as the naturally low precipitation patterns and high temperatures, which makes it an ideal place to carry out research that seeks to aid agriculture in future conditions that are predicted to resemble these scenarios. Our main interest lies in utilizing microorganism consortia from plants thriving under extreme conditions, aiming to promote plant growth, improve crops, and render “unsuitable” soils farmable.', 'TITLE: Search for new resonances in events with one lepton and missing transverse momentum in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: A search for W′ bosons in events with one lepton (electron or muon) and missing transverse momentum is presented. The search uses 3.2 fb−1 of pp collision data collected at s=13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015. The transverse mass distribution is examined and no significant excess of events above the level expected from Standard Model processes is observed. Upper limits on the W′ boson cross-section times branching ratio to leptons are set as a function of the W′ mass. Within the Sequential Standard Model W′ masses below 4.07 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level. This extends the limit set using LHC data at s=8 TeV by around 800 GeV.']"

This research is a quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional study. To collect the data required, a survey was developed, which was applied to 38 students with disability. The main results reveal a high retention rate of students, who exhibit a positive perception of their inclusion in their university life and also a high level of satisfaction with most of the services provided. Seven out of ten students surveyed recognize having received some sort of education care from their programs to pursue their studies. However, there still exists a lack of connection between the current initiatives developed at the university to support the enrollment and permanence of students. Added to this fact, there is a lack of protocols and training for teachers and staff. In this study it is proposed that the university must establish a management system that defines objectives, strategies and actions that contribute to improve inclusion of people with disabilities.', ""TITLE: Within-school segregation in the Chilean school system: What factors explain it? How efficient is this practice for fostering student achievement and equity? | KEYWORDS: Chile; School system; Within-school segregation | ABSTRACT: This paper analyzes the segregation within schools in Chile, looking at the related institutional factors and the effect that this process has on students' academic performance. To analyze the relationship between institutional factors and within-school segregation, it uses a logistic regression, controlling for a set of school characteristics. This analysis finds that within-school segregation is related to institutional factors such as school size and the characteristics of their students. To determine the effects of within-school segregation on academic performance, a multilevel regression model is used, organized in three levels: school, classroom and student. The results show that within-school segregation has negative consequences on educational quality, efficiency and equity, since internal segregation reduces the average educational outcomes of the schools and mostly affects students of middle groups within the school in both academic achievement and socioeconomic terms."", 'TITLE: Mental Health Predicts Better Academic Outcomes: A Longitudinal Study of Elementary School Students in Chile | KEYWORDS: Children; Low-income population; Mental health; School-based services; Screening | ABSTRACT: The world’s largest school-based mental health program, Habilidades para la Vida [Skills for Life (SFL)], has been operating on a national scale in Chile for 15 years. SFL’s activities include using standardized measures to screen elementary school students and providing preventive workshops to students at risk for mental health problems. This paper used SFL’s data on 37,397 students who were in first grade in 2009 and third grade in 2011 to ascertain whether first grade mental health predicted subsequent academic achievement and whether remission of mental health problems predicted improved academic outcomes. Results showed that mental health was a significant predictor of future academic performance and that, overall, students whose mental health improved between first and third grade made better academic progress than students whose mental health did not improve or worsened. Our findings suggest that school-based mental health programs like SFL may help improve students’ academic outcomes.']"

Although significant therapeutic advances have been achieved with drugs such as tamoxifen and trastuzumab, breast cancer still caused 627,000 deaths in 2018. Since cancer is a multifactorial disease, it has become necessary to develop new molecular therapies that can target several relevant cellular processes at once. Ion channels are versatile regulators of several physiological- and pathophysiological-related mechanisms, including cancer-relevant processes such as tumor progression, apoptosis inhibition, proliferation, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance. Ion channels are the main regulators of cellular functions, conducting ions selectively through a pore-forming structure located in the plasma membrane, protein–protein interactions one of their main regulatory mechanisms. Among the different ion channel families, the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family stands out in the context of breast cancer since several members have been proposed as prognostic markers in this pathology. However, only a few approaches exist to block their specific activity during tumoral progress. In this article, we describe several TRP channels that have been involved in breast cancer progress with a particular focus on their binding partners that have also been described as drivers of breast cancer progression. Here, we propose disrupting these interactions as attractive and potential new therapeutic targets for treating this neoplastic disease.', 'TITLE: The Transcription Factors Zeb1 and Snail Induce Cell Malignancy and Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype in Prostate Cells, Increasing Androgen Synthesis Capacity and Therapy Resistance | KEYWORDS: Androgens; Cancer stem cells; epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Prostate cancer; SNAIL; Zeb1 | ABSTRACT: Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence has increased during the last decades, becoming one of the leading causes of death by cancer in men worldwide. During an extended period of prostate cancer, malignant cells are androgen-sensitive being testosterone the main responsible for tumor growth. Accordingly, treatments blocking production and action of testosterone are mostly used. However, during disease progression, PCa cells become androgen insensitive producing a castration-resistant stage with a worse prognosis. Overcoming castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has become a great challenge in the management of this disease. In the search for molecular pathways leading to therapy resistance, the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and particularly the transcription factors zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1) and zinc finger protein SNAI1 (Snail), master genes of the EMT, have shown to have pivotal roles. Also, the discovery that cancer stem cells (CSCs) can be generated de novo from their non-CSCs counterpart has led to the question whereas these EMT transcription factors could be implicated in this dynamic conversion between non-CSC and CSC. In this review, we analyze evidence supporting the idea that Zeb1 and Snail induce cell malignancy and cancer stem cell phenotype in prostate cells, increasing androgen synthesis capacity and therapy resistance.', 'TITLE: Preclinical and Clinical Trials of New Treatment Strategies Targeting Cancer Stem Cells in Subtypes of Breast Cancer | KEYWORDS: biomarker; breast cancer; breast cancer stem cells; metastasis; stemness | ABSTRACT: Breast cancer (BC) can be classified into various histological subtypes, each associated with different prognoses and treatment options, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. Despite advances in this area, many patients still face treatment failure, the risk of metastasis, and disease recurrence, which can ultimately lead to death. Mammary tumors, like other solid tumors, contain a population of small cells known as cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) that have high tumorigenic potential and are involved in cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, tumor recurrence, and resistance to therapy. Therefore, designing therapies specifically targeting at CSCs could help to control the growth of this cell population, leading to increased survival rates for BC patients. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of CSCs, their surface biomarkers, and the active signaling pathways associated with the acquisition of stemness in BC. We also cover preclinical and clinical studies that focus on evaluating new therapy systems targeted at CSCs in BC through various combinations of treatments, targeted delivery systems, and potential new drugs that inhibit the properties that allow these cells to survive and proliferate.']"

Thirty-six Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were randomly assigned to one of three treatments, and cows remained on these treatments for a 62 days period: (1) MIX; cows supplemented with 3 kg of dry matter (DM) of silage containing 1.5 kg DM of MS and 1.5 kg DM of GS in both the morning and afternoon; (2) GS-MS; cows supplemented with 3 kg DM of GS in the morning and 3 kg DM of MS in the afternoon; (3) MS-GS; cows supplemented with 3 kg DM of MS in the morning and 3 kg DM of GS in the afternoon. All cows received a pasture allowance of 17 kg DM/cow/d and 3 kg DM of concentrate. Grazing time and pasture intake were unaffected by treatment; however, milk production was greater for MS-GS, while milk protein was greater for GS-MS. Urinary N excretion was greater for MS-GS than MIX. In conclusion, MS-GS resulted in high milk yield but also high urinary N excretion, while MIX resulted in low urinary N excretion but also decreased milk yield.', 'TITLE: Adaptation responses in milk fat yield and methane emissions of dairy cows when wheat was included in their diet for 16 weeks | KEYWORDS: adaptation; calorimeter; cattle; corn | ABSTRACT: Short-term studies have shown that feeding dairy cows diets containing a high proportion (>40%) of wheat may result in reduced milk fat concentration and reduced CH4 emissions (g of CH4/cow per d), but no long-term studies have been done on these responses. This study compared the milk production and CH4 responses when 24 dairy cows were fed diets containing high proportions of either wheat or corn over 16 wk. Cows were assigned to 2 groups and offered a diet (CRN) containing 10.0 kg of dry matter/d of crushed corn grain, 1.8 kg of dry matter/d of canola meal, 0.2 kg of dry matter/d of minerals, and 11.0 kg of dry matter/d of chopped alfalfa hay or a similar diet (WHT) in which wheat replaced the corn. Dry matter intake and milk yields of individual cows were measured daily. Methane emissions from individual cows were measured using controlled climate respiration chambers over 2 consecutive days during each of wk 4, 10, and 16. Milk composition was measured on the 2 d when cows were in chambers during wk 4, 10, and 16. Over the 16-wk experimental period, total dry matter intake remained relatively constant and similar for the 2 dietary treatment groups. At wk 4, CH4 emission, CH4 yield (g of CH4/kg of dry matter intake), milk fat yield, and milk fat concentration were substantially less in cows fed the WHT diet compared with the same metrics in cows fed the CRN diet; but these differences were not apparent at wk 10 and 16. The responses over time in these metrics were not similar in all cows. In 4 cows fed the WHT diet, CH4 yield, milk fat concentration, and milk fat yield remained relatively constant from wk 4 to 16, whereas for 5 fed the WHT diet, their CH4 emissions, milk fat yields, and milk fat concentrations almost doubled between wk 4 and 16. In the short term (4 wk), the inclusion of approximately 45% wheat instead of corn in the diet of cows resulted in reductions of 39% in CH4 yield, 35% in milk fat concentration, and 40% in milk fat yield. However, these reductions did not persist to wk 10 or beyond. Our data indicate that cows do not all respond in the same way with some “adaptive” cows showing a marked increase in CH4 yield, milk fat concentration, and milk fat yield after wk 4, whereas in other “nonadaptive” cows, these metrics were persistently inhibited to 16 wk. This research shows that short-term studies on dietary interventions to mitigate enteric CH4 emissions may not always predict the long-term effects of such interventions.', 'TITLE: The effect of an organic rumen-protected fat supplement on performance, metabolic status, and health of dairy cows | KEYWORDS: Fat; Fatty acids; Organic; Rumen; Transition | ABSTRACT: Background: Negative energy balance during the transition period is a concern for both conventional and certified organic dairy systems. During early lactation, supplemental strategies are used to cope with nutrient deficiencies that are associated with impaired health, production, and reproduction. As organic certified dairies in the United States face restricted access to dietary supplements, the evaluation of products especially formulated for organic production is needed. Our objective was to assess the effect of supplementing 0.45 kg/d of an organic rumen-protected fat (RPF) on health, metabolic status, and productive and reproductive performance of organic certified Holstein cows from 1 to 150 days in milk (DIM). Two-hundred and two cows were enrolled in a randomized blocked controlled trial conducted from January to July 2017 in a certified organic dairy located in Northern Colorado (USA). Two groups were randomly assigned to be individually supplemented with organic RPF (ORG; n = 100) or control pellets (CON; n = 102) once per day, in addition to the total mixed ration (TMR). Outcomes of interest included milk yield (kg/d) and milk components, serum concentration of glucose, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), resumption of cyclicity, time-to-first artificial insemination (AI), conception at first AI, and conception within 150 DIM, disease occurrence, culling, mortality. Results: A significant effect for the inclusion of RPF was found in daily milk yield; RPF supplemented cows had greater milk yield (1.6 kg/d) compared to CON cows up to 150 DIM (P = 0.03). During grazing, multiparous (MP) ORG cows had greater milk yield compared to MP CON cows, whereas no effect was found in primiparous (PP) cows. Health outcomes, serum metabolite concentrations, and reproductive performance were not affected by the inclusion of RPF. Body condition loss was smaller in the ORG group up to 80 DIM; however, there was no effect on body condition during the grazing season and in the overall study period. Conclusions: These results indicate that supplementation of RPF increased daily milk yield and prevented body condition loss during at 90 DIM. However, RPF supplementation did not affect health, serum metabolite concentration, milk components, and reproductive outcomes.']"

The most employed control techniques are linear control, nonlinear control based on linear and nonlinear feedback, and predictive control. The controllers associated with linear and nonlinear algorithms usually have a fixed switching frequency, featuring a defined spectrum given by the pulse width modulation (PWM) or space vector modulation (SVM) time period. On the other hand, finite set model predictive control (FS-MPC) is known to present a variable switching frequency that results too high for high power applications, increasing losses, reducing the switches lifetime and, therefore, limiting its application. This paper proposes a predictive control approach using a very low sampling frequency, allowing the use of predictive control in high power applications. The proposed method is straightforward to understand, is simple to implement, and can be computed with off-the-shelf digital systems. The main advantage of the proposed control algorithm comes from the combination of the model predictive control and the SVM technique, drawing the principal benefits of both methods. The provided experimental results are satisfactory, displaying the nature of space vector-based schemes but at the same time the fast response as expected in predictive control.', 'TITLE: Model Predictive Control of Modular Multilevel Matrix Converter | KEYWORDS: model predictive control; Modular multilevel matrix converters; power electronics | ABSTRACT: This paper presents a new and simple Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control (FCS-MPC) strategy of the Modular Multilevel Matrix Converter (M3C). This converter is one of the direct AC/AC power converters suitable for medium-voltage high-power machine drives with regenerative capacity. One of the main feature of this converter is that does not need external dc-voltage supplies and thus, all capacitor voltages have to be regulated to the desired value. Therefore, this paper provides a cost function that considers error terms related to the output current and capacitor voltages. Moreover, a compensation input current is presented in order to improve the dynamics response of the capacitor voltage average value. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm is capable to achieving good performance, even in critical operation point of the M3C.', 'TITLE: Model Predictive Voltage Control Strategies for Two-Level Voltage Source Inverters | KEYWORDS: finite-set model predictive control; model predictive control; model predictive voltage control; voltage source inverter | ABSTRACT: Model Predictive Control has emerged as a good alternative for the control of power converters. In this paper, variable and fixed switching frequency model predictive voltage control strategies are presented and analysed for an isolated load. In the fixed frequency scheme, a lower sampling frequency is required to achieve an AC voltage with a total harmonic distortion (THD) less than 5% but with a higher switching frequency compared to the variable frequency operation case. The results done in the simulation show that adding operational constraints to the filter current reduces AC voltage oscillations during transients, without affecting the performance of the voltage control.']"

Traditionally, these RCF buildings are designed to satisfy drift, strength and ductility requirements given by design codes. Reflecting this ubiquity, there has been a significant interest by researchers to develop efficient seismic optimization methods for RCF. Recently, an eigenfrequency optimization method has been proposed, wherein the fundamental period of RCF structures is minimized, and which has potential to be a practical tool to improve the seismic performance of this system. In this work, performance based earthquake engineering (PBEE) is used to assess the effectiveness of this optimization method for a ten story building. For this purpose, a fiber model of this building is subjected to nonlinear dynamic analyses at different seismic intensity levels, and its results are used to perform a time-based assessment to evaluate the building performance over time. The building's collapse risk, expected annual losses and the expected number of casualties are calculated. Additionally, the design characteristics of this building are investigated, including column-to-beam strength ratios and column shear and moment capacities over the height of the building. The findings show that the method produces buildings that have a more uniform drift distribution along its height, with important reductions in the bottom stories and an increase in the top stories. In addition, it reduces the buildings' susceptibility to collapse and the expected number of casualties. In terms of structural changes, it produces distributions of strength and stiffness more suitable to withstand seismic forces, specifically with stronger columns and beams, and a higher ratio of column moment strength to beam moment strength at the base of the building. All in all, results show that a design approach based on period minimization can produce important impacts on seismic design and performance by increasing stiffness - and strength - at the lower stories, particularly in columns, and distributing damage more uniformly over the height of the building."", 'TITLE: Evaluating the response modification factor (R) for reinforced concrete and steel structures equipped with TADAS devices designed for high seismic hazard in Colombia | KEYWORDS: Moment resisting frames; Nonlinear static analysis; Response modification factor; Seismic response control; TADAS damper | ABSTRACT: Colombia is a country with high seismic activity due to its location at the convergence of the Nazca and South American tectonic plates, making structural safety a key priority in the design, construction, and retrofit of buildings. Currently, one of the most used seismic resistance systems are moment-resisting frames, due to their easy construction and good behavior under vertical loads, however, they are susceptible to structural damage when subjected to moderate to high-intensity earthquakes, which makes the use of seismic protection systems an adequate alternative to prevent damage during seismic events. The Colombian seismic design code NSR-10 proposes a design methodology using a linear structure that represents a non-linear behavior of the building when the expected design earthquake occurs through the response modification factor R. However, the NSR-10 seismic design code does not contemplate the response modification factor for structures with seismic protection systems. Therefore, in this research, a design procedure was configured for buildings with moment-resisting frames of reinforced concrete and steel equipped with TADAS (triangular-plate added damping and stiffness) dampers. The procedure evaluated the developed response modification factor of structures located in high seismic hazard areas in Colombia and considered regular buildings with varying numbers of stories and special energy dissipation capacity. The capacity of the structures was evaluated through nonlinear static analysis using the Pushover method in SAP2000 software. Finally, the response modification factors were calculated for regular buildings with moment-resisting frames and different numbers of stories.', 'TITLE: Analysis of the seismic capacity of Chilean residential RC shear wall buildings | KEYWORDS: Chile earthquake; Foundation uplift; Overstrength; Reinforced concrete; Shear walls | ABSTRACT: A very low percentage of reinforced concrete buildings subjected to the 2010 Chile earthquake suffered severe damage, even though they were affected by ground accelerations significantly larger than those prescribed by the Chilean seismic design code. This observation suggests that the seismic capacity of such buildings is actually much larger than that required by the seismic design code. In order to obtain insight into this issue, three actual building structures (of 5, 17 and 26 stories) that withstood the 2010 Chile earthquake with no observable damage are analyzed. A linear elastic concrete material model is adopted. In a first series of analyses, nominal procedures are used to calculate seismic demands and member capacities. In a second series of analyses, seismic demands are calculated by performing response history analysis, and member capacities are evaluated by state-of-the-art procedures. Results from nominal analyses are not consistent with the observed lack of damage in the 17- and 26-story buildings. Results from response history analysis are indeed consistent, but only when foundation uplift is accounted for. The suitability of linear concrete material models to assess the response of apparently undamaged reinforced concrete shear wall structures subjected to strong seismic demands is then discussed.']"

Our approach is based on the introduction of the Cauchy fluid stress and two vector unknowns involving the gradient and the total flux of the concentration. The introduction of these further unknowns lead to a mixed formulation in a Banach space framework in both Stokes and transport equations, where the aforementioned stress tensor and vector unknowns, together with the velocity and the concentration, are the main unknowns of the system. In this way, and differently from the techniques previously developed for this and related coupled problems, no augmentation procedure needs to be incorporated now into the formulation nor into the solvability analysis. The resulting non-augmented scheme is then written equivalently as a fixed-point equation, so that the well-known Banach theorem, combined with Babuška–Brezzi’s theory in Banach spaces, classical results on nonlinear monotone operators and certain regularity assumptions, are applied to prove the unique solvability of the continuous system. As for the associated Galerkin scheme, whose solvability is established similarly to the continuous case by using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, we employ Raviart–Thomas approximations of order k≥ 0 for the stress and total flux, and discontinuous piecewise polynomials of degree k for the velocity, concentration, and concentration gradient. With this choice of spaces, momentum is conserved in both Stokes and transport equations if the external forces belong to the piecewise constants and concentration discrete space, respectively, which constitutes one of the main features of our approach. Finally, we derive optimal a priori error estimates and provide several numerical results illustrating the good performance of the scheme and confirming the theoretical rates of convergence.', 'TITLE: A fully-mixed finite element method for the Navier-Stokes/Darcy coupled problem with nonlinear viscosity | KEYWORDS: a priori error analysis; Darcy problem; fixed point theory; mixed finite element methods; Navier-Stokes problem; stress-velocity formulation | ABSTRACT: We propose and analyze an augmented mixed finite element method for the coupling of fluid flow with porous media flow. The flows are governed by a class of nonlinear Navier-Stokes and linear Darcy equations, respectively, and the transmission conditions are given by mass conservation, balance of normal forces, and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman law. We apply dual-mixed formulations in both domains, and the nonlinearity involved in the Navier-Stokes region is handled by setting the strain and vorticity tensors as auxiliary unknowns. In turn, since the transmission conditions become essential, they are imposed weakly, which yields the introduction of the traces of the porous media pressure and the fluid velocity as the associated Lagrange multipliers. Furthermore, since the convective term in the fluid forces the velocity to live in a smaller space than usual, we augment the variational formulation with suitable Galerkin type terms arising from the constitutive and equilibrium equations of the Navier-Stokes equations, and the relation defining the strain and vorticity tensors. The resulting augmented scheme is then written equivalently as a fixed point equation, so that the well-known Schauder and Banach theorems, combined with classical results on bijective monotone operators, are applied to prove the unique solvability of the continuous and discrete systems. In particular, given an integer k ≥ 0, piecewise polynomials of degree ≤ k, Raviart-Thomas spaces of order k, continuous piecewise polynomials of degree ≤ k + 1, and piecewise polynomials of degree ≤ k are employed in the fluid for approximating the strain tensor, stress, velocity, and vorticity, respectively, whereas Raviart-Thomas spaces of order k and piecewise polynomials of degree ≤ k for the velocity and pressure, together with continuous piecewise polynomials of degree ≤ k + 1 for the traces, constitute feasible choices in the porous medium. Finally, several numerical results illustrating the good performance of the augmented mixed finite element method and confirming the theoretical rates of convergence are reported.', 'TITLE: An augmented mixed FEM for the convective Brinkman–Forchheimer problem: a priori and a posteriori error analysis | KEYWORDS: A posteriori error analysis; A priori error analysis; Convective Brinkman–Forchheimer equations; Fixed point theory; Mixed finite element methods; Pseudoestress–velocity formulation | ABSTRACT: We propose and analyze an augmented mixed finite element method for the pseudostress–velocity formulation of the stationary convective Brinkman–Forchheimer problem in Rd,d∈{2,3}. Since the convective and Forchheimer terms forces the velocity to live in a smaller space than usual, we augment the variational formulation with suitable Galerkin type terms. The resulting augmented scheme is written equivalently as a fixed point equation, so that the well-known Schauder and Banach theorems, combined with the Lax–Milgram theorem, allow to prove the unique solvability of the continuous problem. The finite element discretization involves Raviart–Thomas spaces of order k≥0 for the pseudostress tensor and continuous piecewise polynomials of degree ≤k+1 for the velocity. Stability, convergence, and a priori error estimates for the associated Galerkin scheme are obtained. In addition, we derive two reliable and efficient residual-based a posteriori error estimators for this problem on arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral regions. The reliability of the proposed estimators draws mainly upon the uniform ellipticity of the form involved, a suitable assumption on the data, a stable Helmholtz decomposition, and the local approximation properties of the Clément and Raviart–Thomas operators. In turn, inverse inequalities, the localization technique based on bubble functions, and known results from previous works, are the main tools yielding the efficiency estimate. Finally, some numerical examples illustrating the performance of the mixed finite element method, confirming the theoretical rate of convergence and the properties of the estimators, and showing the behavior of the associated adaptive algorithms, are reported. In particular, the case of flow through a 2D porous media with fracture networks is considered.']"

This marine ectoparasite is mainly controlled through delousing drug treatments that have lost efficacy. Therein, strategies such as salmon breeding selection represent a sustainable alternative to produce fish with resistance to sea lice. This study explored the whole-transcriptome changes in Atlantic salmon families with contrasting resistance phenotypes against lice infestation. In total, 121 Atlantic salmon families were challenged with 35 copepodites per fish and ranked after 14 infestation days. Skin and head kidney tissue from the top two lowest (R) and highest (S) infested families were sequenced by the Illumina platform. Genome-scale transcriptome analysis showed different expression profiles between the phenotypes. Significant differences in chromosome modulation between the R and S families were observed in skin tissue. Notably, the upregulation of genes associated with tissue repairs, such as collagen and myosin, was found in R families. Furthermore, skin tissue of resistant families showed the highest number of genes associated with molecular functions such as ion binding, transferase, and cytokine activity, compared with the susceptible. Interestingly, lncRNAs differentially modulated in the R/S families are located near genes associated with immune response, which are upregulated in the R family. Finally, SNPs variations were identified in both salmon families, where the resistant ones showed the highest number of SNPs variations. Remarkably, among the genes with SPNs, genes associated with the tissue repair process were identified. This study reported Atlantic salmon chromosome regions exclusively expressed in R or S Atlantic salmon families’ phenotypes. Furthermore, due to the presence of SNPs and high expression of tissue repair genes in the resistant families, it is possible to suggest mucosal immune activation associated with the Atlantic salmon resistance to sea louse infestation.', 'TITLE: Ectoparasite Caligus rogercresseyi modifies the lactate response in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) | KEYWORDS: Atlantic salmon; Coho salmon; Lactate; LDH gene; Plasma; Sea lice | ABSTRACT: Although Caligus rogercresseyi negatively impacts Chilean salmon farming, the metabolic effects of infection by this sea louse have never been completely characterized. Therefore, this study analyzed lactate responses in the plasma, as well as the liver/muscle lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and gene expression, in Salmo salar and Oncorhynchus kisutch infested by C. rogercresseyi. The lactate responses of Atlantic and Coho salmon were modified by the ectoparasite. Both salmon species showed increasing in plasma levels, whereas enzymatic activity increased in the muscle but decreased in the liver. Gene expression was overexpressed in both Coho salmon tissues but only in the liver for Atlantic salmon. These results suggest that salmonids need more energy to adapt to infection, resulting in increased gene expression, plasma levels, and enzyme activity in the muscles. The responses differed between both salmon species and over the course of infection, suggesting potential species-specific responses to sea-lice infection.', 'TITLE: Transcriptional response of Atlantic salmon families to Piscirickettsia salmonis infection highlights the relevance of the iron-deprivation defence system | KEYWORDS: Atlantic salmon families; Gene expression; Infection susceptibility; Iron-deprivation; Piscirickettsia salmonis | ABSTRACT: Background: Piscirickettsiosis or Salmonid Rickettsial Septicaemia (SRS) is a bacterial disease that has a major economic impact on the Chilean salmon farming industry. Despite the fact that Piscirickettsia salmonis has been recognized as a major fish pathogen for over 20 years, the molecular strategies underlying the fish response to infection and the bacterial mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. We analysed and compared the head kidney transcriptional response of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) families with different levels of susceptibility to P. salmonis infection in order to reveal mechanisms that might confer infection resistance. Results: We ranked forty full-sibling Atlantic salmon families according to accumulated mortality after a challenge with P. salmonis and selected the families with the lowest and highest cumulative mortalities for microarray gene expression analysis. A comparison of the response to P. salmonis infection between low and high susceptibility groups identified biological processes presumably involved in natural resistance to the pathogen. In particular, expression changes of genes linked to cellular iron depletion, as well as low iron content and bacterial load in the head kidney of fish from low susceptibility families, suggest that iron-deprivation is an innate immunity defence mechanism against P. salmonis. To complement these results, we predicted a set of iron acquisition genes from the P. salmonis genome. Identification of putative Fur boxes and expression of the genes under iron-depleted conditions revealed that most of these genes form part of the Fur regulon of P. salmonis. Conclusions: This study revealed, for the first time, differences in the transcriptional response to P. salmonis infection among Atlantic salmon families with varied levels of susceptibility to the infection. These differences correlated with changes in the abundance of transcripts encoding proteins directly and indirectly involved in the immune response; changes that highlighted the role of nutritional immunity through iron deprivation in host defence mechanisms against P. salmonis. Additionally, we found that P. salmonis has several mechanisms for iron acquisition, suggesting that this bacterium can obtain iron from different sources, including ferric iron through capturing endogenous and exogenous siderophores and ferrous iron. Our results contribute to determining the underlying resistance mechanisms of Atlantic salmon to P. salmonis infection and to identifying future treatment strategies.']"

Here we sought to investigate the effects of IV DMT on the power spectrum and signal diversity of human brain activity (6 female, 7 male) recorded via multivariate EEG, and plot relationships between subjective experience, brain activity and drug plasma concentrations across time. Compared with placebo, DMT markedly reduced oscillatory power in the alpha and beta bands and robustly increased spontaneous signal diversity. Time-referenced and neurophenomenological analyses revealed close relationships between changes in various aspects of subjective experience and changes in brain activity. Importantly, the emergence of oscillatory activity within the delta and theta frequency bands was found to correlate with the peak of the experience - particularly its eyes-closed visual component. These findings highlight marked changes in oscillatory activity and signal diversity with DMT that parallel broad and specific components of the subjective experience, thus advancing our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of immersive states of consciousness.', 'TITLE: Effects of psychedelics on human oscillatory brain activity | KEYWORDS: Alpha power; Complexity; EEG; Functional connectivity; MEG; Psychedelic | ABSTRACT: This chapter reviews the effects of classic psychedelics on human oscillatory brain activity, as measured by resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Across moderate to high doses of LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca, and DMT, a consistent reduction in alpha power (8–13 Hz) emerges, particularly in occipital regions. Below 30 Hz, desynchronization is typical, although DMT can preserve or even increase delta/theta activity, possibly reflecting its immersive, immersive visual phenomenology. Complementing these spectral findings, measures of signal diversity (e.g., Lempel–Ziv complexity) reliably increase during psychedelic states, indicating a more variable and unpredictable pattern of neural firing. Retrospective subjective ratings of the psychedelic experience often fail to align consistently with M/EEG changes, possibly because fleeting, key experiences are obscured by data averaging or recording short segments of a long experience. In contrast, real-time evaluations of subjective intensity and plasma levels robustly covary with changes in spectral power and complexity, highlighting the potential for objective, real-time EEG biomarkers of drug activity. Limited research on functional connectivity and cortical travelling waves suggest that directed, top-down control may decrease while bottom-up signaling increases, indicating a transient reversal of typical hierarchical organization, though replications are warrented. Future work should implement more unified methodological approaches, alongside high-resolution behavioral sampling, to further our understanding of how these altered brain dynamics give rise to the distinctive qualities of the psychedelic experience. Notably, EEG has yet to be evaluated in clinical studies, and future work should aim to explore the relationship between acute EEG changes and clinical responses to psychedelic therapy.', 'TITLE: Effects of External Stimulation on Psychedelic State Neurodynamics | KEYWORDS: complexity; consciousness; neuroscience; psychedelics | ABSTRACT: Recent findings have shown that psychedelics reliably enhance brain entropy (understood as neural signal diversity), and this effect has been associated with both acute and long-term psychological outcomes, such as personality changes. These findings are particularly intriguing, given that a decrease of brain entropy is a robust indicator of loss of consciousness (e.g., from wakefulness to sleep). However, little is known about how context impacts the entropy-enhancing effect of psychedelics, which carries important implications for how it can be exploited in, for example, psychedelic psychotherapy. This article investigates how brain entropy is modulated by stimulus manipulation during a psychedelic experience by studying participants under the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or placebo, either with gross state changes (eyes closed vs open) or different stimuli (no stimulus vs music vs video). Results show that while brain entropy increases with LSD under all of the experimental conditions, it exhibits the largest changes when subjects have their eyes closed. Furthermore, brain entropy changes are consistently associated with subjective ratings of the psychedelic experience, but this relationship is disrupted when participants are viewing a video─potentially due to a “competition” between external stimuli and endogenous LSD-induced imagery. Taken together, our findings provide strong quantitative evidence of the role of context in modulating neural dynamics during a psychedelic experience, underlining the importance of performing psychedelic psychotherapy in a suitable environment.']"

This process is arising in a scenario of rapid forest deforestation and degradation. Therefore, elucidate which forests attributes explain invasibility is a central issue in forest ecology. The Coastal Maulino forest is an endemic forest of central Chile, which has suffered a large history of disturbance, being replaced by large extensions of Pinus radiata plantations. This land transformation conveys high rates of pines invasion into native remnants. In this study we examined to what extent structural features of forest patches explains invasibility of this forest-type. Within eight forest fragments, we sampled 162 plots (10 x 10 m2 each). We quantified seedling pine density and related these estimates with tree cover, litter depth, PAR radiation, and diversity of the resident community. Our results indicate that canopy cover was the most important variable to determine seedling pine density within forest fragments. Our investigation highlights the importance to conserve the forests cover to reduce significantly their invasibility. This action can be effective even if we cannot avoid pine plantations in the region as a source of a massive seed dispersal to forests with well conserved canopy.', 'TITLE: Different times, same story: Native forest loss and landscape homogenization in three physiographical areas of south-central of Chile | KEYWORDS: Chilean temperate forest; Deforestation; Land use - land cover change; Timber plantation | ABSTRACT: Temperate forest represents the smallest area among the main world\'s forest biomes, but is one of those most threatened by forest loss. Chile contains most of the temperate forest in South America and more than half of the temperate forest in the southern hemisphere. Chilean temperate forest is considered to be one of the world\'s biodiversity hotspots. In this study we assessed the rate of land use and land cover (LULC) change over time, identified the main LULCs replacing native forest, and described how changes have evolved in contrasting physiographical conditions and through different historical phases of the landscape over the last 40 years. To achieve this, we analysed LULC change with particular focus on forest cover in three areas representing different physiographical conditions and histories of human occupation in the Araucanía Region of Chile, namely the Central Valley, the Coastal range, and the Andean range. We found substantial differences in temporal and intra-regional patterns of forest loss and LULC change. In the Central Valley, forest loss started long ago, and the area occupied by native forest nowadays is less than 5% of the landscape. In the Coastal range, rapid land cover change has taken place since 1973, with an increasing rate of forest loss over time. We detected a similar but less intense pattern in the forests of the Andean range. Overall, the general pattern points to a process of landscape homogenization in all three physiographical areas. Exotic tree plantations have spread over large geographical areas, becoming the dominant land cover. Land cover change in the Araucanía Region reflects a model of change in which areas with better environmental conditions and accessibility are occupied first for productive activities. As the availability of suitable areas for the expansion of productive activities diminishes, these activities start to move into physiographical areas which were previously ""protected"" by adverse environmental conditions or poor accessibility. This model of production growth could lead to the complete deforestation of areas outside national protected areas, and other areas which still remain inaccessible due to technological restrictions on exploitation.', 'TITLE: Native forest loss in the Chilean biodiversity hotspot: revealing the evidence | KEYWORDS: Deforestation; Exotic tree plantation; Land use and land cover change; Remote sensing; Temperate forest | ABSTRACT: The understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns in land use and land cover (LULC) change is a key issue for conservation efforts. In the Chilean hotspot, different studies have attempted to understand variations of LULC change. Nevertheless, a broader understanding of common patterns and variability of LULC over the entire range of the hotspot is lacking. We performed a complete review of the different studies reporting LULC changes and performed a joint analysis of their results using an integrated comprehensive approach. We related the variation of LULC change to latitude, time period and vascular plant richness using generalized linear models. Overall, there were nine studies, which covered 36.5 % of the study area, and reported the loss of 19 % of native forest (782,120 ha) between 1973 and 2011. The highest net forest loss was observed in the 1970–1990 period. This decreased in the 1990–2000 period and rose again in the 2000–2010 period. This result reveals a continuous forest loss in the last 40 years. Conversion of native forest to shrublands is the most important contributor to net native forest loss, accounting for 45 % of the loss. However, in the area of greatest species richness native forests are mainly converted to exotic tree plantations. Chilean forestry model has proved successful in expanding exotic tree plantation, but so far it has not been compatible with native forest conservation and restoration. It is imperative to design a new forestry policy to assure the conservation of one of the most unique biodiversity hotspots worldwide.']"

We assume that the field is defined spatially on the unit sphere embedded in R3, allowing for modeling data available over large portions of planet Earth. This model admits explicit expressions for the marginal and cross covariances. However, the n-dimensional distributions of the field are difficult to evaluate, because it requires the sum of 2n terms involving the cumulative and probability density functions of a n-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Since in this case inference based on the full likelihood is computationally unfeasible, we propose a composite likelihood approach based on pairs of spatial observations. This last being possible thanks to the fact that we have a closed form expression for the bivariate distribution. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method through simulation experiments and the analysis of a real data set of minimum and maximum surface air temperatures.']"

Here, we obtained samples from 30 localities distributed in the region and used molecular (12S and 16S mitochondrial genes) and morphological (penis) characters to investigate diversity of this poorly known fauna. Results: Molecular phylogenetic analysis consistently recovered five clades, one of which constitutes a cryptic species previously assigned to a species recognized in the area. Four other clades contained sequences of one nominal species consistent with its type locality and at least two additional candidate species, which were corroborated by a particular penis morphology. Furthermore, some morphological differences in penis morphology were observed in two Altiplano populations not resolved by the DNA sequences, providing support for two additional candidate species in the genus. A molecular clock analysis allowed tracing the origin of lineages back to the Early Pleistocene. Conclusions: We found support for recognizing four nominal species, one undescribed species and at least other four candidate species of the genus Heleobia in northern Chile. We also suggest that the current level of species diversity of Heleobia in the region is underestimated by the use of conchological criteria to recognize species and by the limited sampling conducted to date. © 2013 Collado et al.; licensee Springer.', 'TITLE: A new endemic lineage of the Andean frog genus Telmatobius (Anura, Telmatobiidae) from the western slopes of the central Andes | KEYWORDS: Altiplano; Amphibia; Mitochondrial DNA; Molecular clock; Systematics | ABSTRACT: The amphibian genus Telmatobius is a diverse group of species that inhabits the Andes.

In both, the horror is based on the relation between mother and sons, whose tension can be understood from the concept of the abject (Kristeva, 1980). In The Babadook, the horror materializes in the maternal body that is represented as an abject: she appears bathed in blood, puking and chasing her son in order to annihilate him. Also, it develops the traditional metaphorical link between the house and the maternal body (Hormigos, 2010) with the purpose of representing her threatening aspect: the space is imaginated as a confinement that may engulf the body of the self. The film shows the danger of sinking into the mother's body, joy that is forbidden by the also frightening -and also abject- presence of the Father. On the other hand, in Ich seh, ich seh we see the violence that involves the separation of Elias from the law of the mother through the failed elaboration of a sinthome. Also here the signifiers of the abject threaten to annihilate the subjects, and they are represented as elements that contrast with the cleanliness of the domestic space, which is protected from the invasion of the animal and the wild, in order to guard the proper body from.

En The Babadook, el horror se materializa en el cuerpo de la madre que es representado como un abyecto: aparece bañada en sangre, vomitando y persiguiendo a su hijo para aniquilarlo. Se desarrolla además el tradicional vínculo metafórico entre la casa y el cuerpo materno (Hormigos 2010) a fin de expresar su aspecto amenazante: el espacio se piensa como encierro que amenaza con engullir al cuerpo del yo. El filme expone el peligro de hundirse al interior del cuerpo materno, goce que es impedido por la también aterradora -y también abyecta- presencia del Padre.

We obtain the quantum entanglement evolution of the main system qubits and the environment qubits averaging over N = 10 independent experiments in the same quantum device. Our experimental data shows the entanglement and disentanglement signatures in system and enviroment qubits, where the noisy nature of current quantum processors produce a shift on times signaling sudden death or sudden birth of entanglement.

Recently, a need has arisen for efficient sources of entangled photons with high brightness and phase stability, for use in free space and fiber-based quantum communication links. In this work, we present a prototype of EPS based on commercial bulk opto-mechanical components, generating photon pairs via type-0 parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The source is configured in a linear interferometer, where a dual beam displacement is performed by symmetrically disposed birefringent components. The pairs emission can be prepared as an N00N state for quantum sensing, or as a Bell state for entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. We show a maximal Bell inequality violation, on >99% average visibility, proving the high quality of the generated entanglement. The unique geometry of this interferometer is intrinsically symmetric, thus completely removing any temporal walk-off and decoherence between the two components of the Bell state, and enhancing its suitability for various on-field quantum applications.', 'TITLE: Quantum key distribution with entangled photons generated on demand by a quantum dot | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Quantum key distribution - exchanging a random secret key relying on a quantum mechanical resource - is the core feature of secure quantum networks. Entanglement-based protocols offer additional layers of security and scale favorably with quantum repeaters, but the stringent requirements set on the photon source have made their use situational so far. Semiconductor-based quantum emitters are a promising solution in this scenario, ensuring on-demand generation of near-unity-fidelity entangled photons with record-low multiphoton emission, the latter feature countering some of the best eavesdropping attacks. Here, we use a coherently driven quantum dot to experimentally demonstrate a modified Ekert quantum key distribution protocol with two quantum channel approaches: both a 250-m-long single-mode fiber and in free space, connecting two buildings within the campus of Sapienza University in Rome. Our field study highlights that quantum-dot entangled photon sources are ready to go beyond laboratory experiments, thus opening the way to real-life quantum communication.']"

In Chile, population and economic activities are highly concentrated in its central region (i.e. between latitudes 29°S and 40°S), which periodically suffers from severe droughts affecting agriculture, hydropower, and mining. Understanding the dynamics of droughts and large-scale atmospheric processes that influence the occurrence of dry spells is essential for forecasting and efficient early detection of drought events. Central Chile's climate is marked by a significant El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influence that might help to better characterize droughts as well as to identify the effects of ENSO on the spatial and temporal characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts in the region. We analysed the behaviour of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) time series for 6-month accumulation periods over the austral winter and summer seasons. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) showed a significant ENSO influence on dry events for SPEI-6 and SSI-6 during winter and summer. We found that the magnitude of correlation between ENSO and SPEI-6 has changed over the last decades becoming weaker in winter periods and increasing in spring summer periods. Increasing trends in meteorological and hydrological drought events were also identified, along all latitudes, with significant trends during winter in the southern latitudes, and during summer in the semi-arid and Mediterranean zones. These results indicate that drought mitigation actions and policies are necessary to overcome their adverse effects. Given the monthly persistence of ENSO and its relationship to drought indices, there are opportunities for drought monitoring and seasonal forecasting that could become part of national drought management systems."", 'TITLE: Water dynamics over a Western Patagonian watershed: Land surface changes and human factors | KEYWORDS: Reanalysis data; Remote sensing; Trend analysis; Vegetation greenness; Warming effect; Water dynamic | ABSTRACT: Warming trends in Patagonia and severe droughts in recent decades are still poorly understood in terms of their hydrological effects. The effects of climate change on water dynamics in addition to human water management could generate a future water scarcity scenario in one of the regions with the most abundant water resources of Chile. The aim of this work is to focus on assessing the impacts of warming trends on water dynamics in the Patagonian Simpson River watershed during the last two decades. We estimated anomalies in the main components of water balance such as precipitation (P), snow cover (SC), evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflows (Q) as well as surface variables and meteorological forcing (i.e. air temperature - Ta, solar radiation - RS, land surface temperature - LST). The processed data were obtained from remote sensing, reanalysis and in-situ data. We implemented a trend analysis for each variable in the period 2000-2019 at monthly, seasonal and annual scale. Results showed a warming trend in Ta and LST of about 1.2 °C and 2.1 °C, respectively, concentrated mainly in the autumn and winter seasons. Although P showed non-significant trends, Q diminished significantly at rates of more than 9.1 m3/s/decade, representing 36% of its historical mean. However, the decreases in Q are seen only in the maximum (spring) and minimum (summer) seasonal flows. These decreases are explained by significant increases in ET, led by a positive feedback of its drivers (LST, Ta and RS), which is directly linked to the impact of warming and an associated vegetation greenness in the watershed, as well as a decrease in SC during winter that feeds the Simpson River during spring and summer. The decrease in Q is reinforced by the intensification of water withdrawals in recent decades, as shown by an accelerated increase in water rights for agricultural and drinking uses. In a context of water scarcity and increasing and extreme droughts, this work contributes to further understanding water dynamics in western Patagonia, providing support for policy and decision-making when defining sustainable productive practices at watershed scale.', 'TITLE: Water crisis in petorca basin, Chile: The combined effects of a mega-drought and water management | KEYWORDS: Climate change; Conflicts for water; Drought; Streamflow reconstruction; Water access; Water management; Water scarcity | ABSTRACT: Since 2010, Chile has experienced one of the most severe droughts over the last century, the so-called mega-drought (MD). The MD conditions, combined with intensive agricultural activities and the current water management system, have led to water scarcity problems in Mediterranean and Semi-arid regions of Chile. An emblematic case is the Petorca basin, where a water crisis is undergone. To characterize this crisis, we analyzed water provision by using tree-ring records, remote sensing, instrumental data, and allocated water rights within the basin. Results indicate that the MD is the most severe dry period over the last 700-years of streamflow reconstruction. During the MD, streamflow and water bodies of the upper parts of the basin have been less affected than mid and low areas of this valley, where consumptive withdrawals reach up to 18% of the mean annual precipitation. This extracted volume is similar to the MD mean annual precipitation deficits. The impacts of the current drought, along with the drier climate projections for Central Chile, emphasize the urgency for faster policy changes related to water provision. Climate change adaptation plans and policies should enhance the current monitoring network and the public control of water use to secure the water access for inhabitants and productive activities.']"

It is situated at 3,554 m a.s.l., on the top of the Cordón de Tujle ridge forming a north-south striking morphological element in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, in northern Chile. The material erupted at Cerro Tujle lies over the Tucúcaro Ignimbrite (3.2 ± 0.3 Ma), covering the whole area. The origin of the magma source, as well as the evolution and control of the volcanic eruptive styles, were determined by fieldwork, stratigraphic, morphometric, textural (density and vesicularity), petrographic, and geochemical analyses. The Cerro Tujle maar features an elliptical crater (333 × 279 m wide in east-west and north-south directions, respectively) surrounded by lava flow and tephra deposits. The total Dense Rock Equivalent volume of the products was calculated in 1.53 × 105 m3, and mainly correspond to andesites (58.62–59.80 wt% of SiO2). The lava flow can be categorized in at least two types: i) brown-red and green-to-gray andesites located on the north-northwestern flank of the crater, and ii) black andesites with felsic rock clasts distributed around the crater underlying the other lavas. In contrast, the pyroclastic deposit displays breccias of juvenile pyroclasts with xenoliths of rhyolitic composition. These felsic clasts suggest magma assimilation with a shallow magma reservoir during a relatively fast ascent of the magma. This is evidenced by disequilibrium textures in mineral levels, such as reaction rim, and skeletal and sieve textures of the phenocrysts. The field evidence and results of the different analyses suggest a change in the eruptive style from effusive to explosive. This transition is associated with a decrease of the magma flux and a withdrawal of magma below the groundwater table, which has produced a phreatomagmatic eruption by magma-water interaction.', 'TITLE: Pre-eruptive Conditions of the 3 March 2015 Lava Fountain of Villarrica Volcano (Southern Andes) | KEYWORDS: Basaltic volcanism; Fragmentation; Lava lake; Magma ascent; Open-vent; Pyroclast | ABSTRACT: Villarrica or Rukapillan (35.9°S; 2,847 m a.s.l.) is one of the most active volcanoes in South America and is the highest-risk volcano in Chile. It has an open conduit with a persistent lava lake. On the 3 March 2015, Strombolian activity rapidly progressed into a 1.5-km-high lava fountain, erupting at least ∼ 2.4 × 106 m3 of tephra. Soon after, the activity returned to mild Strombolian “background” explosions, which lasted until early 2017. Understanding the pre-eruptive conditions of such paroxysmal events is fundamental for volcanic hazard assessment. We present major and trace element geochemistry for glass and crystalline phases of basaltic andesite paroxysm pyroclasts (52–56 wt.% SiO2), and for the subsequent Strombolian “background” activity through February 2017 (54–56 wt.% SiO2). The lava fountain source magma was initially stored in a deeper and hotter region (9.4–16.3 km; ca. 1140 °C) and was then resident in a shallow (≤ 0.8 km) storage zone pre-eruption. During storage, crystallising phases comprised plagioclase (An66–86), olivine (Fo75–78) and augite (En46–47). Equilibrium crystallisation occurred during upper-crustal magmatic ascent. During storage in the shallower region, magma reached H2O saturation, promoting volatile exsolution and over-pressurization, which triggered the eruption. In contrast, subsequent “background” explosions involving basaltic-andesite were sourced from a depth of ≤ 5.3 km (ca. 1110 °C). Pre-eruptive conditions for the 2015 lava fountain contrast with historical twentieth-century eruptions at Villarrica, which were likely driven by magma that underwent a longer period of mixing to feed both effusive and explosive activity. The rapid transition to lava-fountaining activity in 2015 represents a challenging condition in terms of volcano monitoring and eruption forecasting. However, our petrological study of the pyroclastic materials that erupted in 2015 offers significant insights into eruptive processes involving this type of eruption. This aids in deciphering the mechanisms behind sudden eruptions at open conduit systems.', 'TITLE: Numerical modeling of magma ascent dynamics | KEYWORDS: Conduit geometry; Conduit models; Magma ascent; Numerical models; Phreatomagmatic interaction; Temperature | ABSTRACT: In the world, volcanic systems exhibit a wide range of eruption styles threatening the lives of millions of people. Relatively slow effusive eruptions generate lava flows (low viscosity magma) and lava domes (high viscosity magma) and tend to evolve over days to decades. Alternatively, explosive eruptions can inject very large volumes of fragmented magma and volcanic gas high into the atmosphere over shorter periods (minutes to weeks to months). Mitigation of the associated risk to populations, the built environment, and the cultural heritage relies upon our ability to accurately assess volcanic hazards, and this, in turn, depends on our understanding of the processes that control the style and scale of volcanic eruptions. To this end, technological developments over the last couple of decades have greatly improved our ability to characterize magmatic systems and detect precursors at high spatial and temporal resolution through the use of analytical and observational volcanology, including monitoring-derived data, and volcano geophysics. Numerical modeling of magma ascent can serve to link all of these data and processes to build effective near-real-time strategies. The complexity of the volcanic system, derived from the multiphase, multicomponent character of the magmatic mixtures and from their interaction dynamics with the surrounding host rocks, is however manifested in the complexity of its mathematical representation, and numerical models able to describe several interdependent processes, eventually at disequilibrium conditions, are required to capture the nature of volcanic systems with fidelity. In this chapter, we present the main equations governing magma ascent, highlighting the multiphase and disequilibrium nature of volcanic flows, and the presence of complex feedback mechanisms between gas exsolution, outgassing, and crystallization that are able to influence the most important characteristics of the resulting volcanic events. Then, a suite of numerical simulations is described to show the effect of some parameters and processes in controlling eruption style and scale, and thus the potential eruption hazard.']"

C57BL/6 mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) are a model of insulin resistance. In skeletal muscle, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced by NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) is involved in signaling pathways triggered by insulin. We evaluated oxidative status in skeletal muscle fibers from insulin-resistant and control mice by determining H2O2 generation (HyPer probe), reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratio and NOX2 expression. After eight weeks of HFD, insulin-dependent glucose uptake was impaired in skeletal muscle fibers when compared with control muscle fibers. Insulin-resistant mice showed increased insulin-stimulated H2O2 release and decreased reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG). In addition, p47phox and gp91phox (NOX2 subunits) mRNA levels were also high (~3-fold in HFD mice compared to controls), while protein levels were 6.8- and 1.6-fold higher, respectively. Using apocynin (NOX2 inhibitor) during the HFD feeding period, the oxidative intracellular environment was diminished and skeletal muscle insulin-dependent glucose uptake restored. Our results indicate that insulin-resistant mice have increased H2O2 release upon insulin stimulation when compared with control animals, which appears to be mediated by an increase in NOX2 expression. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.', 'TITLE: Insulin signaling requires glucose to promote lipid anabolism in adipocytes | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Adipose tissue is essential for metabolic homeostasis, balancing lipid storage and mobilization based on nutritional status. This is coordinated by insulin, which triggers kinase signaling cascades to modulate numerous metabolic proteins, leading to increased glucose uptake and anabolic processes like lipogenesis. Given recent evidence that glucose is dispensable for adipocyte respiration, we sought to test whether glucose is necessary for insulin-stimulated anabolism. Examining lipogenesis in cultured adipocytes, glucose was essential for insulin to stimulate the synthesis of fatty acids and glyceride–glycerol. Importantly, glucose was dispensable for lipogenesis in the absence of insulin, suggesting that distinct carbon sources are used with or without insulin. Metabolic tracing studies revealed that glucose was required for insulin to stimulate pathways providing carbon substrate, NADPH, and glycerol 3-phosphate for lipid synthesis and storage. Glucose also displaced leucine as a lipogenic substrate and was necessary to suppress fatty acid oxidation. Together, glucose provided substrates and metabolic control for insulin to promote lipogenesis in adipocytes. This contrasted with the suppression of lipolysis by insulin signaling, which occurred independently of glucose. Given previous observations that signal transduction acts primarily before glucose uptake in adipocytes, these data are consistent with a model whereby insulin initially utilizes protein phosphorylation to stimulate lipid anabolism, which is sustained by subsequent glucose metabolism. Consequently, lipid abundance was sensitive to glucose availability, both during adipogenesis and in Drosophila flies in vivo. Together, these data highlight the importance of glucose metabolism to support insulin action, providing a complementary regulatory mechanism to signal transduction to stimulate adipose anabolism.', 'TITLE: Mitochondrial oxidants, but not respiration, are sensitive to glucose in adipocytes | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Insulin action in adipose tissue is crucial for whole-body glucose homeostasis, with insulin resistance being a major risk factor for metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have proposed mitochondrial oxidants as a unifying driver of adipose insulin resistance, serving as a signal of nutrient excess. However, neither the substrates for nor sites of oxidant production are known. Because insulin stimulates glucose utilization, we hypothesized that glucose oxidation would fuel respiration, in turn generating mitochondrial oxidants. This would impair insulin action, limiting further glucose uptake in a negative feedback loop of ""glucose-dependent"" insulin resistance. Using primary rat adipocytes and cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we observed that insulin increased respiration, but notably this occurred independently of glucose supply. In contrast, glucose was required for insulin to increase mitochondrial oxidants. Despite rising to similar levels as when treated with other agents that cause insulin resistance, glucose-dependent mitochondrial oxidants failed to cause insulin resistance. Subsequent studies revealed a temporal relationship whereby mitochondrial oxidants needed to increase before the insulin stimulus to induce insulin resistance. Together, these data reveal that (a) adipocyte respiration is principally fueled from nonglucose sources; (b) there is a disconnect between respiration and oxidative stress, whereby mitochondrial oxidant levels do not rise with increased respiration unless glucose is present; and (c) mitochondrial oxidative stress must precede the insulin stimulus to cause insulin resistance, explaining why short-term, insulin-dependent glucose utilization does not promote insulin resistance. These data provide additional clues to mechanistically link nutrient excess to adipose insulin resistance.']"

Backyard productive systems (BPS) that breed swine and poultry are widely distributed throughout Chile with high density in the central zone, and several BPS are located within the “El Yali” (EY) ecosystem, which is one of the most important wetlands in South America. Here, 130 different wild bird species have been described, of them, at least 22 species migrate yearly from North America for nesting. For this reason, EY is considered as a high-risk zone for avian influenza virus. This study aims to identify if backyard poultry and swine bred in the EY ecosystem have been exposed to influenza A virus and if so, to identify influenza virus subtypes. A biosecurity and handling survey was applied and samples were collected from BPS in two seasons (spring 2013 and fall 2014) for influenza seroprevalence, and in one season (fall 2014) for virus presence. Seroprevalence at BPS level was 42% (95% CI:22–49) during spring 2013 and 60% (95% CI 43–72) in fall 2014. rRT-PCR for the influenza A matrix gene indicated a viral prevalence of 27% (95% CI:14–39) at BPS level in fall 2014. Eight farms (73% of rRT-PCR positive farms) were also positive to the Elisa test at the same time. One BPS was simultaneously positive (rRT-PCR) in multiple species (poultry, swine and geese) and a H1N2 virus was identified from swine, exemplifying the risk that these BPS may pose for generation of novel influenza viruses.', 'TITLE: Replication-independent reduction in the number and diversity of recombinant progeny viruses in chickens vaccinated with an attenuated infectious laryngotracheitis vaccine | KEYWORDS: Alphaherpesviruses; Diversity; Herpesvirus; Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV); Recombination; Replication; SNP genotyping assay; Vaccine | ABSTRACT: Recombination is closely linked with virus replication and is an important mechanism that contributes to genome diversification and evolution in alphaherpesviruses. Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILTV; Gallid alphaherpesvirus 1) is an alphaherpesvirus that causes respiratory disease in poultry. In the past, natural (field) recombination events between different strains of ILTV generated virulent recombinant viruses that have caused severe disease and economic loss in poultry industries. In this study, chickens were vaccinated with attenuated ILTV vaccines to examine the effect of vaccination on viral recombination and diversity following subsequent co-inoculation with two field strains of ILTV. Two of the vaccines (SA2 and A20) prevented ILTV replication in the trachea after challenge, but the level of viral replication after co-infection in birds that received the Serva ILTV vaccine strain did not differ from that of the mock-vaccinated (control) birds. Even though the levels of viral replication were similar in the two groups, the number of recombinant progeny viruses and the level of viral diversity were significantly lower in the Serva-vaccinated birds than in mock-vaccinated birds.

For the first time in Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC, the yield of D0 mesons was measured down to pT = 0, which allowed a model-independent determination of the pT-integrated yield per unit of rapidity (dN/dy). A maximum suppression by a factor 5 and 2.5 was observed with the nuclear modification factor (RAA) of prompt D mesons at pT = 6–8 GeV/c for the 0–10% and 30–50% centrality classes, respectively.

The measurements are performed with ALICE at the LHC. Different multiplicity classes are defined based on the event activity measured at forward rapidities. The hard scatterings are identified by the leading particle defined as the charged particle with the largest transverse momentum (pT) in the collision and having 8 <pT<15 GeV/c. The pT spectra of associated particles (0.5 ≤pT<6 GeV/c) are measured in different azimuthal regions defined with respect to the leading particle direction: toward, transverse, and away. The associated charged particle yields in the transverse region are subtracted from those of the away and toward regions. The remaining jet-like yields are reported as a function of the multiplicity measured in the transverse region. The measurements show a suppression of the jet-like yield in the away region and an enhancement of high-pT associated particles in the toward region in central Pb–Pb collisions, as compared to minimum-bias pp collisions. These observations are consistent with previous measurements that used two-particle correlations, and with an interpretation in terms of parton energy loss in a high-density quark gluon plasma. These yield modifications vanish in peripheral Pb–Pb collisions and are not observed in either high-multiplicity pp or p–Pb collisions.', 'TITLE: Measurement of multi-particle azimuthal correlations in pp, p + Pb and low-multiplicity Pb + Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Multi-particle cumulants and corresponding Fourier harmonics are measured for azimuthal angle distributions of charged particles in pp collisions at s = 5.02 and 13 TeV and in p + Pb collisions at sNN = 5.02 TeV, and compared to the results obtained for low-multiplicity Pb+Pb collisions at sNN = 2.76 TeV. These measurements aim to assess the collective nature of particle production. The measurements of multi-particle cumulants confirm the evidence for collective phenomena in p + Pb and low-multiplicity Pb+Pb collisions. On the other hand, the pp results for four-particle cumulants do not demonstrate collective behaviour, indicating that they may be biased by contributions from non-flow correlations. A comparison of multi-particle cumulants and derived Fourier harmonics across different collision systems is presented as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity. For a given multiplicity, the measured Fourier harmonics are largest in Pb+Pb, smaller in p + Pb and smallest in pp collisions.

Many heuristic, meta-heuristic and hyper-heuristic methods exist. In the specialized literature, it is observed that for some problems, the combined algorithms have better computational performance than individual performance. However, the automatic combination of the existing methods or the automatic design of new algorithms has received less attention in the literature. In this study, a method to automatically design algorithms is put into practice for two optimization problems of recognized computational difficulty: the traveling salesman problem and the automatic clustering problem. The new algorithms are generated by means of genetic programming and are numerically evaluated with sets of typical instances for each problem. From an initial population of randomly generated algorithms, a systematic convergence towards the better algorithms is observed after a few hundred generations. Numerical results obtained from the evaluation of each of the designed algorithms suggest that for each set of instances with similar characteristics, specialized algorithms are required.', 'TITLE: Automatic Generation of Metaheuristic Algorithms | KEYWORDS: Automatic generation of algorithm; Genetic programming; Metaheuristics; Traveling salesman problem | ABSTRACT: Designing a heuristic algorithm to solve an optimization problem can also be seen as an optimization problem. Such a problem seeks to determine the best algorithm contained in the search space. The objective function corresponds to the computational performance of the algorithm measured in terms of computational time, complexity, number of instructions or number of elementary operations. The automatic design of algorithms has been explored for several combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we extend this exploration towards the automatic design of metaheuristics to find solutions for the traveling salesman problem. The process is carried out by genetic programming. The resulting algorithms are combinations of well-known metaheuristics and, in some cases, present better computational performance than the existing algorithms for the set of selected test instances.', 'TITLE: Automatic design of specialized algorithms for the binary knapsack problem | KEYWORDS: Automatic generation of algorithms; Binary knapsack problem; Generative design of algorithms; Genetic programming; Hyperheuristic | ABSTRACT: Not all problem instances of a difficult combinatorial optimization problem have the same degree of difficulty for a given algorithm. Surprisingly, apparently similar problem instances may require notably different computational efforts to be solved. Few studies have explored the case that the algorithm that solves a combinatorial optimization problem is automatically designed. In consequence, the generation of the best algorithms may produce specialized algorithms according to the problem instances used during the constructive step. Following a constructive process based on genetic programming that combines heuristic components with an exact method, new algorithms for the binary knapsack problem are produced. We found that most of the automatically designed algorithms have better performance when solving instances of the same type used during construction, although the algorithms also perform well with other types of similar instances. The rest of the algorithms are partially specialized. We also found that the exact method that only solves a small knapsack problem has a key role in such results. When the algorithms are produced without considering such a method, the errors are higher. We observed this fact when the algorithms were constructed with a combination of instances from different types. These results suggest that the better the pre-classification of the instances of an optimization problem, the more specific and more efficient are the algorithms produced by the automatic generation of algorithms. Consequently, the method described in this article accelerates the search for efficient methods for NP-hard optimization problems.']"

However, studies using MXenes as solid lubricants have mainly focused on multi-layer Ti3C2Tx coatings, while little is known about the tribological performance of MXene composites. Therefore, our study aims at scrutinizing and understanding the tribological behavior of MXenes and MXene composites as solid lubricants under reciprocating sliding conditions. Theoretical predictions regarding the resulting interlayer adhesion and coating-substrate adhesion helped to design the hybrid coatings. Multi-layer Ti3C2Tx, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and two hybrid coatings using Ti3C2Tx and MoS2 (random mixture and sandwich-like) were spray-coated onto steel substrates with a coating thickness of about 800 nm. Dry sliding tests using a steel ball as counter-body were carried out at room temperature. The coatings’ morphology and formed tribofilms were holistically characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Our results demonstrate that both hybrid coatings notably reduce friction and wear, outperforming their respective pure coatings (Ti3C2Tx and MoS2). This is attributed to synergistic effects between Ti3C2Tx and MoS2, with adhesion forces appearing to be the governing mechanism in enhancing the formation of stable tribofilms. Numerical calculations validate our experimental results, verifying that hybrid coatings exhibit low interlayer friction and high adhesion to ferrous substrates. Consequently, our work reveals the potential of Ti3C2Tx/MoS2 hybrid coatings to further optimize friction and wear.']"

As expected, the homoleptic copper (I) complexes with the N,N ligands showed air instability. In contrast, the obtained heteroleptic complexes were air- and water-stable in solid and solution. All complexes displayed green-yellow luminescence in CH2Cl2 at room temperature due to ligand-centred (LC) phosphorescence in the case of the Cu(I) complex with an unsubstituted N,N ligand and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) phosphorescence for the carboxymethyl-substituted complexes. Interestingly, proper substitution of the bis(1H-indazol-1-yl)methane ligand enabled the achievement of a remarkable luminescent yield (2.5%) in solution, showcasing the great potential of this novel class of copper(I) complexes for potential applications in luminescent devices and/or photocatalysis.', 'TITLE: Pentacoordinate chloro-iron(III) complexes based on new asymmetric salophen-N2O2 ligands: Structural, magnetic, and theoretical studies | KEYWORDS: Antiferromagnetic coupling; Asymmetric ligands; Iron(III); Pentacoordinate complexes; Schiff base ligands | ABSTRACT: Pentacoordinate iron(III) complexes have been significant in several catalytic processes and bioinorganic applications due to their unique structural features.

In this work, using numerical simulations, we analyze the influence of shape on the equilibrium state and the dynamic response of magnetization to a magnetic field in asymmetric Ni nanowires. Depending on geometric and magnetic parameters, two equilibrium states emerge in such particles, the flower and twisted flower states. The nucleated magnetic configuration is determined by the asymmetry degree of the nanowire. These states are defined by the orientation of magnetic moments in the top and bottom regions of the nanowire, while the shape anisotropy ensures a monodomain in the bulk. Concerning the dynamical response, the number and frequencies of the peaks correlate with the minimum energy configuration. Our findings provide a basis for controlling frequency spectra in magnetic nanowires through precise adjustments of geometric parameters.']"

This paper offers such insights for prospective mathematics teachers’ initial knowledge of problem solving (PS) for teaching at the beginning of their teacher education programme.

Snow accumulation shows that rates are higher on the west side relative to the east side for both icefields. The values depend on the PPM used and reach a mean difference of 1,500 mm w.e., with some areas reaching differences higher than 3,500 mm w.e. These differences could lead to divergent mass balance estimations depending on the scheme used to define the snow accumulation.

Since 2000, the application of this instrument has decreased, which is interpreted as a movement of expulsion from social housing to the peri-urban area of the city. In this framework, this work analyzes the location of social housing built between 2000 and 2017 in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, to identify patterns of expulsion, displacement, and/or segregation of the beneficiaries of this policy. Through a mixed strategy that combined analysis of secondary information, photointerpretation of satellite images, and interviews with the director of municipal works of peri-urban distrits, we conclude that: 1) there is no evidence of a process of massive displacement of households in social housing towards the peri-urban of the city after the 1990s, and 2) the production of social housing, both in the city of Santiago and in its peri-urban, is lower than the new housing requirements, increasing the housing deficit. It is concluded that the current scenario is one of exclusion of the new poor households from the Santiago housing market, rather than of displacement or increase in residential segregation.']"

Materials and Methods: A structured questionnaire was applied to a non-probabilistic sample of 347 students at the Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, Chile. The instruments for collecting information included the SWLS (Satisfaction with Life Scale), SWFL (Satisfaction with Food-related Life) and the HRQOL (Health-related Quality of Life Index).

Surveys in parents and children demonstrated that healthy food consumption was under the Chilean Dietary Guidelines recommendatiolns. Consumption of fruits, vegetables and dairy food in parents was less than in children, but nonhealthy food consumption was also less in parents. In dietary behavior 22% of children consumed breakfast at home and also at school, and 33% consumed double lunch. Snack was carried from home in 60% of children, but 72% carried money to buy non-healthy snacks at school. Parents said that they had norms related to dietary behavior at home, but 60% watched TV during dinner and 96% had afternoon tea and just 42.2% had dinner. Regarding culinary habits, students had the skills to prepare simple food but did not have the skills to prepare a dish. The mothers said they had the culinary skills but they cook simple food like pasta, rice and potatoes. Focus groups confirmed survey findings, identifying three profiles in mothers and separating eating behaviour during the weekdays and weekend. Its notorious that mothers consuming a healthy diet were those who had more health problems. Barriers to healthy eating were lack of time and money. Surveys and focus groups showed a good access by parents and children to Information and Communication Technologies. In conclusion, it is urgent to design nutrition education programs to create healthy eating habits considering the current situation in food consumption, dietary behaviour and culinary habits in students and their parents.']"

In order to gain a better understanding of potential intraplate tectonic events associated with the geodynamic evolution of the active margin of southwestern Gondwana, we conducted a tectono-sedimentary study of the Permian-Jurassic volcano-sedimentary record in the Deseado Massif, located in southern Patagonia. Our multidisciplinary analysis includes detailed geological mapping of an area of approximately 150 km2, structural analysis, geoelectric tomography, 2D seismic data, new geochronological dating, petrographic studies, and stratigraphic loggings of the volcano-sedimentary basin record. This comprehensive data set has allowed us to establish the tectonic, sedimentary, and magmatic evolution of the eastern Deseado Massif. Specifically, we have identified major normal faults associated with the syn-extensional deposition of late Permian and Jurassic sedimentary and volcanic rocks, as well as the Late Triassic emplacement of intermediate and felsic intrusive bodies. Additionally, interspersed large-scale shortening events were recognized, which induced positive tectonic inversion events in the region, recording contrasting stress fields during the analyzed lapse. Based on this, six major intraplate tectonomagmatic events were defined: (i) a potential post-Devonian pre-late Permian exhumation of the Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic igneous-metamorphic basement, which we tentatively link to the Gondwanide orogeny; (ii) intraplate extension in the Late Permian (255 ± 4 Ma) related to the deposition of the Dos Hermanos Member of the La Golondrina Formation; (iii) Late Triassic (231 ± 3 Ma) intrusion of andesitic bodies, tentatively linked to the inland migration of arc magmatism associated with the South Gondwana flat slab; (iv) subsequent Late Triassic positive tectonic inversion of Permian extensional faults caused by a large-scale contractional event linked to the South Gondwana flat slab; (v) the extension-related emplacement and deposition of Early-Middle Jurassic (176 ± 3 Ma; 172 ± 4 Ma) sedimentary (lacustrine and fan deltas-related deposits), pyroclastic rocks (ignimbrites and ash tuffs), and lavas (lava domes and dykes) related to the Chon Aike silicic large igneous province; and (vi) poorly-constrained post-Middle Jurassic positive tectonic inversion of Jurassic faults. Therefore, we suggest that the geological events preserved in the Deseado Massif provide a key deformational record of the distal effects associated with ancient geodynamic processes that occurred along the southwestern active margin of Gondwana.', 'TITLE: Evidence for two stages of back-arc compression in the late Cretaceous fold-and-thrust belt in the Precordillera of northern Chile (24°30′S–25°30′S) | KEYWORDS: Fold-and-thrust belt; K-T deformation; Late cretaceous; Peruvian phase; Precordillera of northern Chile | ABSTRACT: In the Andean forearc of northern Chile, the interplay between deformation and magmatism is not fully understood. Outcrops in the Precordillera of northern Chile record a long and complex history of magmatism and overprinting deformational events. The growth of the Precordillera is predominantly associated with the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene transpressive Domeyko fault system (Incaic Phase), however, a series of compressive late Cretaceous folds and faults have also been recognized. In this study, we combined structural mapping, stereographic fold analysis, and geochronologic data of both deformed rocks and post-tectonic hypabyssal bodies to reveal the distribution and kinematics of the late Cretaceous thrust system exposed in the Precordillera between 24°30′S and 25°30′S. We identified an approximately NS-striking belt of reverse faults and folds along the Precordillera, which was cut and displaced by the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene Domeyko fault system. This deformation corresponds to thick-skinned structures affecting Paleozoic basement and thin-skinned structures which include folding with a general sub-horizontal NNW-SSE shortening direction with westward and eastward vergence. The ages of post-tectonic hypabyssal bodies cutting the deformed rocks indicate that the timing of the contractional structures occurred before 86 Ma taking place in the westernmost margin of Precordillera and continued between 72 Ma and 65 Ma. Our results agree with the timing proposed for regional Peruvian and ‘K-T’ deformations. We also used the distribution of the syn-kinematic late Cretaceous volcanic rocks to identify late Cretaceous contraction that evolved into a back-arc fold-and-thrust belt. Its structures are currently distributed along the northern Precordillera and were obliterated by younger strike-slip Incaic deformation. Moreover, this deformation must have forced the topography upward, creating an early late Cretaceous topographic relief related to the tectonic activity along these structures. These results indicate that late Cretaceous deformation had a role in the early history of the proto-Precordillera of northern Chile, prior to development of the strike-slip Domeyko fault system in the Paleogene.', 'TITLE: Evidence for two stages of back-arc compression in the late Cretaceous fold-and-thrust belt in the Precordillera of northern Chile (24°30′S–25°30′S) | KEYWORDS: Fold-and-thrust belt; K-T deformation; Late cretaceous; Peruvian phase; Precordillera of northern Chile | ABSTRACT: In the Andean forearc of northern Chile, the interplay between deformation and magmatism is not fully understood.

The significant changes to the Chilean Constitution have been frequent and fast, and they have accompanied the failed constitution-making processes of the previous years. Examples include crucial sub-constitutional statutes such as the electoral system regulation and same-sex marriage, political practices challenging the power of the president in the law-making process, constitutional rules such as term limits for legislators, judicial practices such as the enforcement of social rights and the amendment procedures of the Constitution itself. Despite the successful attempts at reforming the Constitution and the failed attempts at replacing it, Chileans are still trying to replace the constitutional document. However, the constitutional framework has become unstable, making it harder to agree on what exactly is wrong with it. This article seeks to open a conversation in the constitutional literature. It argues that constitutions can become moving targets and uses the Chilean case to show the need to theorize more about the moving target problem.', 'TITLE: What Constitution?

The April 1, 2014, Pisagua earthquake broke the middle segment of the megathrust. Some slip models suggest that it ruptured mainly from a depth of 30 to 55 km along dip and over 180 km in length, reaching a magnitude Mw 8.1–8.2. The northern and southern segments are still unbroken; thus, there is still a large area that could generate a Mw > 8.5 earthquake with a strong tsunami. To better understand the effects of source parameters on the impact of a tsunami in the near field, as a case study, we characterize earthquake size for a hypothetical and great seismic event, Mw 9.0, in northern Chile. On the basis of physical earthquake source models, we generate stochastic k−2 finite fault slips taking into account the non-planar geometry of the megathrust in northern Chile. We analyze a series of random slip models and compute vertical co-seismic static displacements by adding up the displacement field from all point sources distributed over a regular grid mesh on the fault. Under the assumption of passive generation, the tsunami numerical model computes the runup along the shore. The numerical results show a maximum peak-runup of ~35–40 m in the case of some heterogeneous slip models. Instead, the minimum runup along the coast, from the heterogeneous slip models tested, almost coincides with the runup computed from the uniform slip model. This latter assumption underestimates the runup by a factor of ~6 at some places along the coast, showing agreement with near-field runups calculated by other authors using similar methodologies, but applied in a different seismotectonic context. The statistical estimate of empirical cumulative distribution functions conducted on two subsets of slips, and their respective runups, shows that slip models with large amount of slip near the trench are more probable to produce higher runups than the other subset. The simple separation criterion was to choose slip models that concentrate at least 60 % of the total seismic moment in the upper middle part of the non-planar rupture fault.', 'TITLE: A rapid estimation of near-field tsunami runup | KEYWORDS: earthquakes; finite fault model; runup; subduction zones; tsunami | ABSTRACT: Many efforts have been made to quickly estimate the maximum runup height of tsunamis associated with large earthquakes. This is a difficult task because of the time it takes to construct an accurate tsunami model using real-time data from the source. It is possible to construct a database of potential seismic sources and their corresponding tsunami a priori. However, such models are generally based on uniform slip distributions and thus oversimplify the knowledge of the earthquake source. Here we show how to predict tsunami runup from any seismic source model using an analytic solution that is specifically designed for subduction zones with a well-defined geometry, i.e., Chile, Japan, Nicaragua, and Alaska. The main idea of this work is to provide a tool for emergency response, trading off accuracy for speed. The solutions we present for large earthquakes appear promising. Here runup models are computed for the following: the 1992 Mw 7.7 Nicaragua earthquake, the 2001 Mw 8.4 Perú earthquake, the 2003 Mw 8.3 Hokkaido earthquake, the 2007 Mw 8.1 Perú earthquake, the 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule earthquake, the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake, and the recent 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique earthquake. The maximum runup estimations are consistent with measurements made inland after each event, with a peak of 9 m for Nicaragua, 8 m for Perú (2001), 32 m for Maule, 41 m for Tohoku, and 4.1 m for Iquique. Considering recent advances made in the analysis of real-time GPS data and the ability to rapidly resolve the finiteness of a large earthquake close to existing GPS networks, it will be possible in the near future to perform these calculations within the first minutes after the occurrence of similar events. Thus, such calculations will provide faster runup information than is available from existing uniform-slip seismic source databases or past events of premodeled seismic sources.', 'TITLE: Structural Control on Megathrust Rupture and Slip Behavior: Insights From the 2016 Mw 7.8 Pedernales Ecuador Earthquake | KEYWORDS: aftershock sequence; megathrust rupture; subduction zone earthquakes | ABSTRACT: The heterogeneous seafloor topography of the Nazca Plate as it enters the Ecuador subduction zone provides an opportunity to document the influence of seafloor roughness on slip behavior and megathrust rupture. The 2016 Mw 7.8 Pedernales Ecuador earthquake was followed by a rich and active postseismic sequence. An internationally coordinated rapid response effort installed a temporary seismic network to densify coastal stations of the permanent Ecuadorian national seismic network. A combination of 82 onshore short and intermediate period and broadband seismic stations and six ocean bottom seismometers recorded the postseismic Pedernales sequence for over a year after the mainshock. A robust earthquake catalog combined with calibrated relocations for a subset of magnitude ≥4 earthquakes shows pronounced spatial and temporal clustering. A range of slip behavior accommodates postseismic deformation including earthquakes, slow slip events, and earthquake swarms. Models of plate coupling and the consistency of earthquake clustering and slip behavior through multiple seismic cycles reveal a segmented subduction zone primarily controlled by subducted seafloor topography, accreted terranes, and inherited structure. The 2016 Pedernales mainshock triggered moderate to strong earthquakes (5 ≤ M ≤ 7) and earthquake swarms north of the mainshock rupture close to the epicenter of the 1906 Mw 8.8 earthquake and in the segment of the subduction zone that ruptured in 1958 in a Mw 7.7 earthquake.']"

This longitudinal study examined how perceived group similarity and outgroup trust mediate the effects of cross-group friendship on acculturation preferences (culture maintenance and culture adoption) of the receiving society. It was predicted that cross-group friendship would affect acculturation preferences over time, and that these relationships would be partly mediated by outgroup trust and perceived group similarity. A three-wave full longitudinal sample (N = 467 Chilean school students) was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results confirmed that cross-group friendship longitudinally predicted majority members’ support for the adoption of Chilean culture (via perceived group similarity) and Peruvian culture maintenance (via outgroup trust).

Two studies of disadvantaged groups (Ns = 689 ethnic minority members in Study 1 and 3,382 sexual/gender minorities in Study 2) support the hypothesis that, after accounting for the effects of intergroup contact and perceived illegitimacy, satisfying the need for empowerment (but not acceptance) during contact is positively related to support for social change.

Total phenolic, total flavonoid, and total anthocyanin contents were measured by spectrophotometry, anthocyanin and phenolic profiles were analyzed by chromatography, and the antioxidant capacity was determined. This study is probably the first to demonstrate the variation and stability of bioactive compounds from maqui berries after applying different drying methods. RESULTS: The highest content of phenolic and antioxidant compounds was obtained by using the freeze-drying method compared with fresh samples (P < 0.05). Eight anthocyanins were identified in all dehydrated maqui samples. Compared with fresh maqui, freeze-dried samples retained 73% and 64% of delphinidin and cyanidin derivatives respectively. Sun- and vacuum-dried samples conserved some phenolic acids. Vacuum-dried maqui retained a higher amount of free flavonols.

Does this relationship change according to freedom levels of media systems and degrees of political polarization? To answer these questions, this study analyzes data from 10 Latin American countries included in the last round of the World Values Survey (2017-2020) (N = 11,769), as well as indices of governments' intervention in the news system and polarization by the V-Dem project. Statistical results show that, in general, exposure to news on social media is negatively related to trust in government and state institutions. However, context makes a significant difference: the higher the level of media freedom and polarization, the more negative this relationship becomes. In contrast, traditional media news use is positively associated with political trust, regardless of contextual factors.

Current research has paid little attention to this problem at the local level in non-Western and peripheral media systems. By qualitatively analyzing six case studies of local news digital media in Chile, this article explores the connection between digital media business models and territory. The main findings suggest that the territorial dimension is most visible in media sustainability, community-building, and journalistic value. A single analytical model for both national and local media may be inadequate; therefore, a contextual and comprehensive approach to each media ecosystem is suitable to better understand media business models.', 'TITLE: Emergence of rebellious digital press in Chile: Divergence, engagement and impact | KEYWORDS: Journalism; Media convergence; Social media; Social networks; Technological innovation | ABSTRACT: This paper examines the divergence and impact of Chilean news media and their uses of facebook as a tool to deliver news and information and engagement with their audience. It also looks at the emergence of new digital media organizations during the last decade in Chile as a response to a concentrated duopoly market in the country. To do so, this paper considers notions of technological and cultural innovation in the newsroom and the concept of media convergence form a technological point of view to explain the current situation of media and journalists’ habit us. Following Pavlik’s idea that “journalism has always been shaped by technology” (2000, p. 229), this article discusses that both new and old media had been influenced by the current state of the technology, and today they have to standardize their practices in order to maintain a fluent communication between the audiences and the news industry. Therefore, this article supposes that the convergence of digital practices does not only affect journalism as a profession, but also present a challenge to transform the way journalism is practice and the way news worker do their jobs. A case study of Chilean media organizations is used to illustrate the change in the relationship between news and their public.']"

Through the direct observation of the shadow of a black hole by the event horizon telescope and the detection of gravitational waves of merging black holes we now start to have direct access to their properties and behaviour, which means the properties and behaviour of gravity. This further raised the demand for models to compare with those observations. In this respect, an important question regarding black holes properties is to know if they can support ""hairs"". While this is famously forbidden in general relativity, in particular for scalar fields, by the so-called no-hair theorems, hairy black holes have been shown to exist in several class of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. In this article we investigate the existence of scalarized black holes in scalar-torsion theories of gravity. On one hand, we find exact solutions for certain choices of couplings between a scalar field and the torsion tensor of a teleparallel connection and certain scalar field potentials, and thus proof the existence of scalarized black holes in these theories. On the other hand, we show that it is possible to establish no-scalar-hair theorems similar to what is known in general relativity for other choices of these functions.']"

In addition, there was a positive trend for all the projects regarding the LAP indicators in the long term. Furthermore, the percentage of plan completed (PPC) stabilized in all projects, improving the level of LPS maturity.

The last planner system (LPS) has proven to increase planning reliability; however, improving the management of commitments in weekly planning meetings is necessary. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a commitment management system (CMS) using the fundamental elements of the linguistic action perspective (LAP) in synergy with the LPS. Design science research (DSR) was used to develop the CMS through three iterations (artifacts) that were applied in construction projects in Chile and Colombia. To evaluate and validate the artifact, the following two approaches were used: (1) internal, conducted by the research team through reflections on each artifact and its consequences, and (2) external, through quantitative and qualitative results. The main results led to the development of a pioneering system of commitment management in construction projects, which proved to be a practical contribution when implemented, showing positive results in participants' statements, CMS indicators, LPS indicators, and performance (time deviation). Additionally, in terms of theoretical contributions, the CMS allows reinforcing the LPS with the incorporation of specific LAP fundamentals in construction projects through a (1) system containing indicators to measure and control the management of commitments, (2) flowchart of specific commitments for construction projects, and (3) six-phase implementation plan to be replicated. The main conclusions regarding the CMS are that it allows to: (1) manage commitments by focusing on the foreman (or supervisor), (2) implement a plan that allows replication of this system, (3) improve trust and teamwork based on participants' statements, and (4) improve performance in time deviation of construction projects.""]"

One of the important ecological niches of this yeast that has been extensively studied is wine fermentation, a complex microbiological process in which S. cerevisiae faces various stresses such as limited availability of nitrogen. Nitrogen deficiencies in grape juice impair fermentation rate and yeast biomass production, leading to sluggish or stuck fermentations, resulting in considerable economic losses for the wine industry. In the present work, we took advantage of the “1002 Yeast Genomes Project” population, the most complete catalogue of the genetic variation in the species and a powerful resource for genotype-phenotype correlations, to study the adaptation to nitrogen limitation in wild and domesticated yeast strains in the context of wine fermentation. We found that wild and domesticated yeast strains have different adaptations to nitrogen limitation, corroborating their different evolutionary trajectories. Using a combination of state-of-the-art bioinformatic (GWAS) and molecular biology (CRISPR-Cas9) methodologies, we validated that PNP1, RRT5 and PDR12 are implicated in wine fermentation, where RRT5 and PDR12 are also involved in yeast adaptation to nitrogen limitation. In addition, we validated SNPs in these genes leading to differences in fermentative capacities and adaptation to nitrogen limitation.

The Kennicutt-Schmidt relation in Virgo cluster galaxies | KEYWORDS: Galaxies: general; Galaxies: ISM; Galaxies: star formation | ABSTRACT: Aims. In this Virgo Environment Traced in CO (VERTICO) science paper, we aim to study how the star formation process depends on the galactic environment and gravitational interactions in the context of galaxy evolution. We explore the scaling relation between the star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) and the molecular gas surface density (Σmol), also known as the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, in a subsample of Virgo cluster spiral galaxies. Methods. We used new Atacama Compact Array and Total Power (ACA+TP) observations from the VERTICO-Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program at 720 pc resolution to resolve the molecular gas content, as traced by the 12CO (2 - 1) transition, across the disks of 37 spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster. In combination with archival UV and IR observations used to determine the star formation rate (SFR), we estimated the parameters of the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation for the entire ensemble of galaxies, and within individual galaxies. Results. We find the KS slope for the entire population to be N = 0.97 ± 0.07, with a characteristic molecular gas depletion time of 1.86 Gyr for our full sample, which is in agreement with previous work in isolated, nearby star-forming galaxies. In individual galaxies, we find that the KS slope ranges between 0.69 and 1.40, and that typical star formation efficiencies of molecular gas can vary from galaxy to galaxy by a factor of ∼4. These galaxy-to-galaxy variations account for ∼0.20 dex in scatter in the ensemble KS relation, which is characterized by a 0.42 dex scatter. In addition, we find that the HI-deficient galaxies in the Virgo cluster show a steeper resolved KS relation and lower molecular gas efficiencies than HI-normal cluster galaxies. Conclusions. While the molecular gas content in galaxies residing in the Virgo cluster appears - to first order - to behave similarly to that in isolated galaxies, our VERTICO sample of galaxies shows that cluster environments play a key role in regulating star formation. The environmental mechanisms affecting the HI galaxy content also have a direct impact on the star formation efficiency of molecular gas in cluster galaxies, leading to longer depletion times in HI-deficient members.', 'TITLE: The EDGE-CALIFA Survey: An integral field unit-based integrated molecular gas database for galaxy evolution studies in the Local Universe | KEYWORDS: Galaxies: evolution; Galaxies: ISM; Galaxies: star formation; ISM: molecules | ABSTRACT: Studying galaxy evolution requires knowledge not only of the stellar properties, but also of the interstellar medium (in particular the molecular phase) out of which stars form, using a statistically significant and unbiased sample of galaxies. To this end, we introduce here the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), a collection of integrated stellar and nebular emission lines, and molecular gas properties from 643 galaxies in the local Universe. These galaxies are drawn from the CALIFA datasets, and are followed up in CO lines by the APEX, CARMA, and ACA telescopes. As this database is assembled from data coming from a heterogeneous set of telescopes (including IFU optical data and single-dish and interferometric CO data), we adopted a series of techniques (tapering, spatial and spectral smoothing, and aperture correction) to homogenise the data. Due to the application of these techniques, the database contains measurements from the inner regions of the galaxies and for the full galaxy extent. We used the database to study the fundamental star formation relationships between star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M∗), and molecular gas mass (Mmol) across galaxies with different morphologies. We observed that the diagrams defined by these quantities are bi-modal, with early-type passive objects well separated from spiral star-forming galaxies. Additionally, while the molecular gas fraction (fmol = Mmol/M∗) decreases homogeneously across these two types of galaxies, the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/Mmol) in the inner regions of passive galaxies is almost two orders of magnitude lower compared to the global values. This indicates that inside-out quenching requires not only low fmol, but also strongly reduced SFE in the galactic centres.', 'TITLE: The EDGE-CALIFA survey: The effect of active galactic nucleus feedback on the integrated properties of galaxies at different stages of their evolution | KEYWORDS: Galaxies: active; Galaxies: evolution; Galaxies: ISM; Galaxies: Seyfert; Galaxies: star formation; ISM: molecules | ABSTRACT: Galaxy quenching, the intricate process through which galaxies transition from active star-forming states to retired ones, remains a complex phenomenon that requires further investigation. This study investigates the role of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in regulating star formation by analyzing a sample of 643 nearby galaxies with redshifts between 0.005 and 0.03 from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. Galaxies were classified according to the Quenching Stages and Nuclear Activity (QueStNA) scheme, which categorizes them based on their quenching stage and the presence of nuclear activity. We further utilized the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution (iEDGE), which combined homogenized optical integral field unit and CO observations. This allowed us to examine how AGNs influence the molecular gas reservoirs of active galaxies compared to their non-active counterparts at similar evolutionary stages. Our Kolmogorov-Smirnov and χ2 tests indicate that the star formation property distributions and scaling relations of AGN hosts are largely consistent with those of non-active galaxies. However, AGN hosts exhibit systematically higher molecular gas masses across all quenching stages except for the quiescent nuclear ring stage. We find that AGN hosts follow the expected trends of non-active quenching galaxies, characterized by a lower star formation efficiency and molecular gas fraction compared to star-forming galaxies. Our results suggest that signatures of instantaneous AGN feedback are not prominent in the global molecular gas and star formation properties of galaxies.']"

The proposed index is based on tuned-spatial-domain filtering, which works by combining two Laplace operators to simultaneously quantify the global infrared-imaging fixed-pattern-noise and the global or local blur artifacts. The index effectiveness is demonstrated by two task-based image-quality assessments to determine the focused and fixed-pattern-noise free images from sequences captured with both a mid-wave-infrared microscope system and a long-wave-infrared plenoptic system. The index quantitative limits are shown on numerical computations over synthetic corrupted images as well as real black-body radiator calibrated infrared images with representative simulated fixed-pattern noise, from six well known infrared focal plane arrays transducer technologies, along with artificial blur added using real infrared imaging system point spread functions.', 'TITLE: A Unified Method for Digital Super-Resolution and Restoration in Infrared Microscopy Imaging | KEYWORDS: fixed pattern noise (FPN); image reconstruction; image restoration; Infrared (IR) imaging; microscopy; nonuniformity correction; resolution enhancement; super resolution | ABSTRACT: Infrared (IR) imaging systems are known to have a range of sensor and optical limitations that result in degraded imagery.

Although polarized endurance training optimizes and maximizes physiological gains in highly trained individuals, its cardiometabolic protective-effects have not been established. The purpose of the present single site, randomized-controlled trial was to compare the effects of 12-weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), and polarized volume training (POL) programs on cardiometabolic risk factors in young overweight and obese women. Materials and Methods: A total of 64 overweight/obese young women (age 23.3 ± 3.8 years, body mass index 33.8 ± 3.8 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to four groups: control group (CTRL), polarized volume training group, moderate-intensity endurance training group, and HIIT group. The cardiorespiratory capacity, glycemic and lipid profiles, whole-body substrate utilization, and body composition were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: After the intervention, VO2peak and power output at VO2peak increased in all exercised-groups (time effect: p < 0.0001). Power output at VT1 was increased only in the POL group compared to the CTRL group (p = 0.019). Relative fold changes in fasting plasma glucose concentrations decreased only in POL group (p = 0.002).

Objective: To characterize the physiological effects and inter-individual variability on fat mass and other health-related and physical performance outcomes after 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and dietary energy restriction in overweight/obese adult women. Methods: Thirty untrained adult overweight and obese women (age = 27.4 ± 7.9 years; BMI = 29.9 ± 3.3 kg/m2) successfully completed a 12-week supervised HIIT program and an individually prescribed home hypocaloric diet (75% of daily energy requirements) throughout the whole intervention. High and low responders to the intervention were those individuals who were able to lose ≥ 10 and < 10% of initial absolute fat mass (i.e., kilograms), respectively. Results: The prevalence for high and low responders was 33% (n = 11) and 66% (n = 19), respectively. At the whole group level, the intervention was effective to reduce the absolute fat mass (30.9 ± 7.2 vs. 28.5 ± 7.2 kg; p < 0.0001), body fat percentage (39.8 ± 4.3 vs. 37.8 ± 4.9%; p < 0.0001), and total body mass (76.7 ± 10.1 vs. 74.4 ± 9.9 kg; p < 0.0001). In addition, there were improvements in systolic blood pressure (SBP; Δ% = −5.1%), diastolic blood pressure (DBP; Δ% = −6.4%), absolute VO2peak (Δ% = +14.0%), relative VO2peak (Δ% = +13.8%), peak power output (PPO; Δ% = +19.8%), anaerobic threshold (AT; Δ% = +16.7%), maximal ventilation (VE; Δ% = +14.1%), and peak oxygen pulse (O2 pulse; Δ% = +10.4%). However, at the individual level, a wide range of effects were appreciated on all variables, and the magnitude of the fat mass changes did not correlate with baseline body mass or fat mass. Conclusion: A 12-week supervised HIIT program added to a slight dietary energy restriction effectively improved fat mass, body mass, blood pressure, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). However, a wide range of inter-individual variability was observed in the adaptative response to the intervention. Furthermore, subjects classified as low responders for fat mass reduction could be high responders (HiRes) in many other health-related and physical performance outcomes. Thus, the beneficial effects of exercise in obese and overweight women go further beyond the adaptive response to a single outcome variable such as fat mass or total body mass reduction.']"

This focus has moved from centering on negative experiences, related to psychopathology and stigmatization, to examining subjective wellbeing factors in individuals belonging to these populations. In Latin American countries such as Chile, a scarcely explored link in this regard is satisfaction with life –the cognitive component of subjective well-being– and associated variables. The minority stress model indicates that individuals who belong to minority groups are exposed to additional stressors to which the general population is not exposed. These specific stressors are related to the marginalization, prejudice and exclusion suffered by the minority group of belonging. Researchers have shown that these stressors and their consequences may result in lower life satisfaction in non-heterosexual people compared to their heterosexual peers. Furthermore, different non-heterosexual orientations face specific forms of prejudice and, therefore, could experience a different impact on their life satisfaction. In this paper, the distinction is made between individuals with a monosexual orientation (towards one gender) and those with a plurisexual orientation, (towards more than one gender or independently of gender); namely, lesbians and gay men (LG) on the one hand, and bisexuals and pansexuals (BP) on the other. Research indicates that BP people experience lower levels of well-being than LG individuals. Compared to the latter, BP individuals tend to disclose their sexual orientation to a lesser extent, perceive less social support, and experience greater exclusion from community spaces destined to the general community of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and other queer identities (LGBTIQ+). Moreover, these differences between non-heterosexual orientations in terms of life satisfaction have been little explored in Latin American university students. To fill this gap in the literature, the general objective of this study was to compare the levels of disclosure of sexual orientation, perceived social support, connectedness with the LGBTIQ+ community, and life satisfaction among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and pansexual university students. Four hypotheses were proposed that addressed the comparisons between LG and BP participants for these variables. A non-probability sample of 82 LGBP university students was recruited to answer an online questionnaire. Of the sample, 32.9 % were lesbian or gay, and 67.1 % were bisexual or pansexual. Most participants were women (67.1 %), compared to 29.3 % men and 3.7 % of another gender. The questionnaire consisted of a section of sociodemographic data, a sexual orientation disclosure scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the LGBTIQ + Community Connectedness Scale, and the Life Satisfaction Scale. Analyses included comparisons of means between groups. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted for the Connectedness Scale to test its validity. Results showed that LG and BP students reported similar levels of perceived social support, community connectedness, and life satisfaction, while LG students tended to disclose their sexual orientation to more people than BP students. A positive association was also found between perceived social support and life satisfaction, and between connectedness and disclosure of sexual orientation. The CFA showed that the Connectedness Scale is valid for its use in university samples in Chile and other Latin American populations. Limitations regarding sample size and recommendations for future research are discussed. This study contributes to the knowledge about variables associated with life satisfaction in non-heterosexual university students, highlighting the differential needs for support of those with a monosexual orientation (lesbians and gays) and those with a plurisexual orientation (bisexual and pansexual).']"

For example, they can further increase their bioactivity with cells. However, most of the hydrogels present problems related to their processability, consequently limiting their use in 3D printing to produce tailor-made scaffolds. The goal of this work is to develop bioconjugated hydrogel nanocomposite inks for 3D printed scaffold fabrication through a micro-extrusion process having improved both biocompatibility and processability. The hydrogel is based on a photocrosslinkable alginate bioconjugated with both gelatin and chondroitin sulfate in order to mimic the cartilage extracellular matrix, while the nanofiller is based on graphene oxide to enhance the printability and cell proliferation. Our results show that the incorporation of graphene oxide into the hydrogel inks considerably improved the shape fidelity and resolution of 3D printed scaffolds because of a faster viscosity recovery post extrusion of the ink. Moreover, the nanocomposite inks produce anisotropic threads after the 3D printing process because of the templating of the graphene oxide liquid crystal. The in vitro proliferation assay of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs) shows that bioconjugated scaffolds present higher cell proliferation than pure alginate, with the nanocomposites presenting the highest values at long times. Live/Dead assay otherwise displays full viability of hADMSCs adhered on the different scaffolds at day 7. Notably, the scaffolds produced with nanocomposite hydrogel inks were able to guide the cell proliferation following the direction of the 3D printed threads. In addition, the bioconjugated alginate hydrogel matrix induced chondrogenic differentiation without exogenous pro-chondrogenesis factors as concluded from immunostaining after 28 days of culture. This high cytocompatibility and chondroinductive effect toward hADMSCs, together with the improved printability and anisotropic structures, makes these nanocomposite hydrogel inks a promising candidate for cartilage tissue engineering based on 3D printing.', 'TITLE: Development of Soft Wrinkled Micropatterns on the Surface of 3D-Printed Hydrogel-Based Scaffolds via High-Resolution Digital Light Processing | KEYWORDS: 3D porous scaffolds; stereolithography; wrinkled nonplanar surfaces | ABSTRACT: The preparation of sophisticated hierarchically structured and cytocompatible hydrogel scaffolds is presented.

For the congenital transmission to occur, both parasites must cross the barrier present in the mammalian placenta, which differs between species. Particularly, hemochorial, endotheliochorial and epitheliochorial placental barriers are present, respectively, in human, dog and sheep. The type of placental barrier has been associated with the probability of transmission of pathogens. In this study, we used experimental placental ex vivo infection models of T. cruzi and T. gondii in the above-mentioned mammals in order to study tissue alterations and to compare infection efficiency. Here, we infected placental term explants from human, dog and sheep and analyzed tissue damage by standard histological and histochemical methods. Comparative infection efficiency was determined by quantitative PCR. Both parasites are able to infect the different placental explants; however, more T. gondii parasites were detected, and T. gondii causes a more severe tissue damage in human and canine explants than T. cruzi. The histopathological changes observed in ovine placenta explants were similar in presence of both parasites. We conclude that the infection efficiency of T. gondii is higher, compared to T. cruzi, during the ex vivo infection of human, canine and ovine placental explants. In addition, the ex vivo infection of mammalian placental explants constitutes an interesting experimental approach to study part of the infection mechanisms as well as host responses during congenital infection of both parasites.', 'TITLE: The immune response against Trypanosoma cruzi in the human placenta | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Congenital Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), is partially responsible for the increasing globalization of Chagas disease despite its low transmission. During congenital transmission, the parasite reaches the fetus by crossing the placental barrier. However, the success or impairment of congenital transmission of the parasite is the product of a complex interaction between the parasite, the maternal and fetus/ newborn immune responses and placental factors. There is other evidence apart from the low congenital transmission rates, which suggests the presence of defense mechanisms against T. cruzi.

The measurements span the energy range 2-22 GeV and were performed using forward and reversed horn focusing modes of the Fermilab low-energy NuMI beam to obtain large neutrino and antineutrino samples. The flux is obtained using a subsample of charged-current events at low hadronic energy transfer along with precise higher energy external neutrino cross section data overlapping with our energy range between 12-22 GeV. We also report on the antineutrino-neutrino cross section ratio, RCC, which does not rely on external normalization information. Our ratio measurement, obtained within the same experiment using the same technique, benefits from the cancellation of common sample systematic uncertainties and reaches a precision of ∼5% at low energy.

The ratio of the quasielastic, flux-integrated differential cross section in Q2 for νe with that of similarly selected νμ-induced events from the same exposure is used to probe assumptions that underpin conventional treatments of charged-current νe interactions used by long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

However, the exact role displayed by their grain structure in mechanical properties has not been yet fully understood. Here, by means of molecular dynamics simulations, the role of grain boundary structure during the nanoindentation of metallic hollow nanoparticles with a polycrystalline shell was investigated. Our simulations were performed for a range of grain sizes and shell thicknesses, including the large strain regime. Our results show that hNP mechanical properties can be controlled by tuning the grain size of the polycrystalline shell, following an inverse Hall-Petch type dependence with the grain size. Deformation involves dislocation activity, twin hardening, grain boundary sliding, coalescence, and rotation. For single crystal shells at large strain there is hardenning following the closure of the internal cavity. For nanocrystalline shells at large strains a constant flow stress regime is observed even for deformations as high as 80%, thanks to grain boundary activity. Surprisingly, some particular grain size not only leads to an improvement in strength, but also a flow stress higher than the observed in their single-crystalline counterparts. Our work, suggest that grain boundary structure can be employed to improve and tailor desired mechanical properties in hollow nanostructures.', ""TITLE: Simulations of plasticity in diamond nanoparticles showing ultrahigh strength | KEYWORDS: Diamond; Dislocations; Indentation; Nanoparticles; Plasticity | ABSTRACT: We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to deform single crystal spherical carbon nanoparticles (NP), 4–45 nm diameter, with a hard, flat indenter, compressing along the [001] direction.

Whether at the domestic, regional or global levels, such a phenomenon has increasingly become perceived as a conundrum, if not an overall crisis, for modern paradigms of legal and political authority. Building upon the array of case studies that the phenomenon has already elicited, this paper advances four interrelated arguments. First, descriptively, it contends that the administrative state has experienced a large-scale transformation due to the proliferation of a varied, multifaceted and fast evolving range of private regulatory practices. Second, methodologically, after mapping the way these private regulatory practices have been conceptualised in post-national legal theories, it conveys the importance of moving beyond the state of the art by adopting a phenomenological approach to contemporary legal orderings. Third, drawing upon comparative analysis of competition law, it distinguishes two broad models that have emerged to address the private regulation phenomenon: (i) the private ordering model, predominant in the US; and (ii) the private police powers model, predominant in the EU, which, I claim, could be productively understood from a doctrinal perspective as an emergent private administrative law. Finally, at a normative level, I conclude positioning such a private administrative law model as a distinctive conceptual framework to reflect upon the place, role and the very significance of law within a landscape of contemporary political economies characterised by an expanding topography of private regulators.', 'TITLE: Modern Conceptions of Procedural Due Process and the Right to a Fair Trial in Civil Matters | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This chapter describes a long and winding road on the Supreme Court case law in non-criminal matters, into what might characterize as a modern conception on procedural due process. It begins by describing the context that marked the transformation of the traditional approach followed by the Supreme Court into the current approach in non-criminal matters. In this regard, it focuses on the Due Process revolution as an attempt to broaden the protection of procedural due process and to search for a test to determine what is the procedure that is due once the clause is triggered beyond criminal law. Then, it describes how the case law led to the Mathews v. Eldridge test, the current approach used by the Court, and the debates that have arisen in the last decades regarding, class actions, statistical adjudication and arbitration. It also briefly addresses the right of access to a court and its relationship with the right to a due process. Finally, it explores some possible explanations and provides some future research question regarding the question on why the constitutional doctrine in civil matters has been much more recent and thinner than in criminal law issues.', 'TITLE: Why Civil and Criminal Procedures Require Different Theories on Procedural Due Process | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: In this chapter I argue that civil justice needs to escape the shadow of criminal justice. Although due process, both in criminal and non-criminal matters, shares a common theoretical core based on the concept of procedural fairness, they differ in important respects. Based on a model designed between purpose and parties’ relative position of power in the legal procedure, I argue in civil matters procedural fairness not only requires procedural rights in order to ensure accurate determination of fact as proxy for a quality outcome, but also to ensure a legal need has been satisfied, a dispute solved, a right has been protected. Procedural due process, in this regard, and as an inherent element of it, requires also access to the legal procedure and the capacity to maintain it until the end. In this sense, a procedure would also be unfair, no matter how accurate it might be or protective of procedural guarantees, if it is too costly or ineffective to be useful.']"

Previous studies reported increased levels of neutralizing antibodies and specific T cells 2 and 4 weeks after two doses of CoronaVac; these levels were significantly reduced at 6 to 8 months after the two doses. Here, we report the effect of a booster dose of CoronaVac on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response generated against the variants of concern (VOCs), Delta and Omicron, in adults participating in a phase III clinical trial in Chile. Volunteers immunized with two doses of CoronaVac in a 4-week interval received a booster dose of the same vaccine between 24 and 30 weeks after the second dose. Neutralization capacities and T cell activation against VOCs Delta and Omicron were assessed 4 weeks after the booster dose. We observed a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies 4 weeks after the booster dose. We also observed a rise in anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific CD41 T cells over time, and these cells reached a peak 4 weeks after the booster dose. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells induced by the booster showed activity against VOCs Delta and Omicron. Our results show that a booster dose of CoronaVac increases adults’ humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. In addition, immunity induced by a booster dose of CoronaVac is active against VOCs, suggesting adequate protection. IMPORTANCE CoronaVac is an inactivated vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that has been approved by WHO for emergency use. Phase III clinical trials are in progress in several countries, including China, Brazil, Turkey, and Chile, and have shown safety and immunogenicity after two doses of the vaccine. This report characterizes immune responses induced by two doses of CoronaVac followed by a booster dose 5 months after the second dose in healthy Chilean adults. The data reported here show that a booster dose increased the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, enhancing levels of neutralizing antibodies against the ancestral strain and VOCs. Similarly, anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD41 T cell responses were increased following the booster dose. In contrast, levels of gamma interferon secretion and T cell activation against the VOCs Delta and Omicron were not significantly different from those for the ancestral strain. Therefore, a third dose of CoronaVac in a homologous vaccination schedule improves its immunogenicity in healthy volunteers.', 'TITLE: Recognition of Variants of Concern by Antibodies and T Cells Induced by a SARS-CoV-2 Inactivated Vaccine | KEYWORDS: antibodies; CoronaVac; SARS-CoV-2; T cell immunity; vaccine; variants of concern | ABSTRACT: Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible of the current pandemic ongoing all around the world. Since its discovery in 2019, several circulating variants have emerged and some of them are associated with increased infections and death rate. Despite the genetic differences among these variants, vaccines approved for human use have shown a good immunogenic and protective response against them. In Chile, over 70% of the vaccinated population is immunized with CoronaVac, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The immune response elicited by this vaccine has been described against the first SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from Wuhan, China and the D614G strain (lineage B). To date, four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern described have circulated worldwide. Here, we describe the neutralizing capacities of antibodies secreted by volunteers in the Chilean population immunized with CoronaVac against variants of concern Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) Gamma (P.1) and Delta (B.617.2). Methods: Volunteers enrolled in a phase 3 clinical trial were vaccinated with two doses of CoronaVac in 0-14 or 0-28 immunization schedules. Sera samples were used to evaluate the capacity of antibodies induced by the vaccine to block the binding between Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from variants of concern and the human ACE2 receptor by an in-house ELISA. Further, conventional microneutralization assays were used to test neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, interferon-γ-secreting T cells against Spike from variants of concern were evaluated in PBMCs from vaccinated subjects using ELISPOT. Results: CoronaVac promotes the secretion of antibodies able to block the RBD of all the SARS-CoV-2 variants studied. Seropositivity rates of neutralizing antibodies in the population evaluated were over 97% for the lineage B strain, over 80% for Alpha and Gamma variants, over 75% for Delta variant and over 60% for the Beta variant. Geometric means titers of blocking antibodies were reduced when tested against SARS-CoV-2 variants as compared to ancestral strain. We also observed that antibodies from vaccinated subjects were able to neutralize the infection of variants D614G, Alpha, Gamma and Delta in a conventional microneutralization assay. Importantly, after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we observed that the blocking capacity of antibodies from vaccinated volunteers increased up to ten times for all the variants tested. We compared the number of interferon-γ-secreting T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 Spike WT and variants of concern from vaccinated subjects and we did not detect significant differences.

During Run 2 of the LHC, a luminosity of ℒ = 2 × 1034 cm-2 s-1 was routinely achieved at the start of fills, twice the design luminosity. For Run 3, accelerator improvements, notably luminosity levelling, allow sustained running at an instantaneous luminosity of ℒ = 2 × 1034 cm-2 s-1, with an average of up to 60 interactions per bunch crossing. The ATLAS detector has been upgraded to recover Run 1 single-lepton trigger thresholds while operating comfortably under Run 3 sustained pileup conditions. A fourth pixel layer 3.3 cm from the beam axis was added before Run 2 to improve vertex reconstruction and b-tagging performance. New Liquid Argon Calorimeter digital trigger electronics, with corresponding upgrades to the Trigger and Data Acquisition system, take advantage of a factor of 10 finer granularity to improve triggering on electrons, photons, taus, and hadronic signatures through increased pileup rejection. The inner muon endcap wheels were replaced by New Small Wheels with Micromegas and small-strip Thin Gap Chamber detectors, providing both precision tracking and Level-1 Muon trigger functionality. Trigger coverage of the inner barrel muon layer near one endcap region was augmented with modules integrating new thin-gap resistive plate chambers and smaller-diameter drift-tube chambers. Tile Calorimeter scintillation counters were added to improve electron energy resolution and background rejection. Upgrades to Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators and Forward Detectors improve luminosity monitoring and enable total proton-proton cross section, diffractive physics, and heavy ion measurements. These upgrades are all compatible with operation in the much harsher environment anticipated after the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC and are the first steps towards preparing ATLAS for the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC.

Increasing speed not only allows for faster trips but also a higher frequency with the same fleet size, thus reducing waiting times and crowdedness inside the vehicles. This interest in speed has ignored a second key dimension in the level of service: reliability. In this article, we provide a review of a full range of impacts of an unreliable public transport service. We show how regularizing headway could improve level of service beyond the gains of simply increasing the operational speed. Regular headways positively affect comfort, reliability, travel and wait time, operational costs, and even some urban impacts of bus services. Thus, the focus for public transport agencies and operators should bend into reliability’s direction. This is fundamental for making public transport an attractive travel alternative, and therefore must become a core goal for urban sustainability.', 'TITLE: The underlying effect of public transport reliability on users’ satisfaction | KEYWORDS: Crowding level; Headway irregularity; Public transport satisfaction | ABSTRACT: Service reliability has an important impact on the satisfaction stated by public transport users with the service they receive. The main source of unreliability is found in headway variance, which also affects waiting times and distributes passengers unevenly across vehicles. However, it is still unclear how headway irregularity, with its impact in waiting, crowdedness and reliability, affect travellers’ service satisfaction. Different stated preference studies have identified non-linear impacts produced by overcrowding. However, none of these studies is directly related to users’ satisfaction evaluation. In this study, we investigate the existence of this non-linearity in users’ satisfaction caused by both the crowding level and the number of denied boardings through a post-service satisfaction survey of bus and metro users. An Ordered Logit Model was estimated, accounting for sample heteroscedasticity and preference heterogeneity. Overall, there is a significant and negative perception of the bus mode, keeping all other attributes equal. For users under 35 years old, comfort experienced almost always plays an important role in service satisfaction, while for those over 35 years old women are significantly more sensitive to this attribute. Most important, crowding has a negative and non-linear impact on how passengers evaluate their travel satisfaction. Using a Likert-type scale, this curve is convex. This relationship between crowding and satisfaction might bias service planning and delivery if performance indicators associated to service are not properly weighted by the number of passengers served. Improving level of service indicators in this direction might provide public transport agencies a clearer and more accurate perception of the actual users’ experience.', ""TITLE: Public transport reliability across preferences, modes, and space | KEYWORDS: Aggregate demand; Public transport; Transport planning; Travel time reliability; Traveller's experience | ABSTRACT: Reliability is understood in public transport as the certainty travellers have regarding the level of service they will experience when travelling. The travel time, waiting time, or the comfort level they will experience inside the vehicle are some of the most important reliability attributes. Reliability is usually neglected from travel behavioural models, since there is a lack of studies addressing its impact in travellers’ choices. This study proposes an in-depth analysis and characterization of travel time reliability in a public transport system using passive data only, which every day is getting more popular worldwide. The study is comprised of two parts, taking Transantiago (the public transport system of Santiago, Chile) as a study case, as it is a good representation of a frequency-based public transport system. In the first part a statistical and graphical analysis of travel times is conducted, focusing on characterizing headway and travel time reliability of public transport services as well as the effect of dedicated infrastructure, based on smartcard transactions and GPS information. In the second part an aggregate mode choice model based on revealed data is developed to analyse the effect of travel time reliability on travellers’ preferences. Overall, this study provides evidence of significant differences among headway variability and in-vehicle travel time dispersion different public transport modes. The standard deviation (a measure of dispersion) can be quite high for bus trips, while in the case of metro is smaller than 4 min independent of trip length. Regarding the aggregate public transport mode choice model, the coefficient of variation of headways is a key attribute to explain modal preferences. It was found that average bus users would accept traveling ~ 5 min longer to completely avoid headway irregularity. All these results were obtained by analysing passive-data from AFC and AVL systems only, which represents a novel approach for choice modelling. Transport modellers should consider the impact of service reliability to improve route choice and passenger assignment models, and better represent users’ perceptions and behaviour.""]"

H. pylori is acquired largely in early childhood, however, the benefits of eradication in children are controversial. We aimed to determine the effect of H. pylori eradication on clinical and laboratory markers associated with gastric damage in apparently healthy school-aged children. Methods: This was a pilot non-blinded trial including 61 children persistently infected with H. pylori who were randomized to eradication/no treatment and followed for at least 12 months, evaluating clinical and blood markers (Pepsinogen I (PGI) and II (PGII) determined by ELISA) associated with gastric damage. The treatment consisted of a sequential scheme including 7 days of omeprazole + amoxicillin followed by 7 days of omeprazole + clarithromycin + metronidazole; adherence and tolerance were surveyed. Eradication rates were assessed by stool antigen detection or urea breath test 1 month following treatment every 4 months thereafter to detect reinfection. Results: Eradication occurred in 30/31 treated children (median age: 8.8, range: 7.9–10.8) and in 0/30 non-treated controls (median age: 8.6, range: 7.9–11) (p <.001). Treatment was associated with mild transient symptoms (altered taste, nocturnal upper abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea). Baseline frequency of symptoms was low and eradication did not change symptoms compared to controls. PGI, PGII, and anti-H. pylori seropositivity were similar in both groups at baseline and significantly decreased only in eradicated patients; PGI (92.5 vs. 74.4, p <.001), PGII (15.2 vs. 8.9, p <.001) levels, and frequency of anti-H. pylori seropositivity (100 vs. 68%, p <.001) respectively. Four eradicated children (13%) were reinfected during follow-up.

Despite such associations, the bacterium frequently persists in the human host without inducing disease, and it has been suggested that H. pylori may also play a beneficial role in health. To understand how H. pylori can produce such diverse effects in the human host, several studies have focused on understanding the local and systemic effects triggered by this bacterium. One of the main mechanisms by which H. pylori is thought to damage the host is by inducing local and systemic inflammation. However, more recently, studies are beginning to focus on the effects of H. pylori and its metabolism on the gastric and intestinal microbiome. The objective of this review is to discuss how H. pylori has co-evolved with humans, how H. pylori presence is associated with positive and negative effects in human health and how inflammation and/or changes in the microbiome are associated with the observed outcomes.', 'TITLE: Plant-Based Polyphenols: Anti-Helicobacter pylori Effect and Improvement of Gut Microbiota | KEYWORDS: Bioactive compounds; Gut microbiota; Helicobacter pylori | ABSTRACT: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection affects more than half of the world’s population, and thus, about 10 to 20% of people with H. pylori suffer from peptic ulcers, which may ultimately lead to gastric cancer. The increase in antibiotic resistance and susceptibility has encouraged the search for new alternative therapies to eradicate this pathogen. Several plant species are essential sources of polyphenols, and these bioactive compounds have demonstrated health-promoting properties, such as the gut microbiota stimulation, inflammation reduction, and bactericidal effect. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the potential effect of plant-based polyphenols against H. pylori and their role in the gut microbiota improvement.']"

Although image processing techniques have been developed to map spatial-temporal data into two-dimensional representations, they alter the geometrical construction of the glottis and do not provide standard quantitative features, thus challenging clinical interpretation. In response, we propose a new visualization and analysis framework for assessing the dynamics of vocal folds based on the empirical distribution of the glottal edge using HSV. This procedure analyzes vocal fold oscillations by preserving the shape of the glottis and quantifying the asymmetry between right and left vocal fold displacements along the anterior-posterior axis. This method was evaluated on four groups of participants: ten with normal voices, ten with vocal fold nodules, ten with muscle tension dysphonia, and two with unilateral vocal fold paralysis. The proposed method produces distinct representations for normal and pathological vocal fold vibratory behaviors and derived features based on amplitude and phase asymmetry metrics that show statistically significant differences between normal and pathological groups. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art techniques indicates that our proposed method can complement the assessment of vocal fold vibration and enhance the clinical translation of HSV.', ""TITLE: Using ambulatory voice monitoring to investigate common voice disorders: Research update | KEYWORDS: Accelerometer; Glottal inverse filtering; Machine learning; Vocal function; Vocal hyperfunction; Voice disorders; Voice monitoring | ABSTRACT: Many common voice disorders are chronic or recurring conditions that are likely to result from inefficient and/or abusive patterns of vocal behavior, referred to as vocal hyperfunction. The clinical management of hyperfunctional voice disorders would be greatly enhanced by the ability to monitor and quantify detrimental vocal behaviors during an individual's activities of daily life. This paper provides an update on ongoing work that uses a miniature accelerometer on the neck surface below the larynx to collect a large set of ambulatory data on patients with hyperfunctional voice disorders (before and after treatment) and matched-control subjects. Three types of analysis approaches are being employed in an effort to identify the best set of measures for differentiating among hyperfunctional and normal patterns of vocal behavior: (1) ambulatory measures of voice use that include vocal dose and voice quality correlates, (2) aerodynamic measures based on glottal airflow estimates extracted from the accelerometer signal using subject-specific vocal system models, and (3) classification based on machine learning and pattern recognition approaches that have been used successfully in analyzing long-term recordings of other physiological signals. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential for ambulatory voice monitoring to improve the diagnosis and treatment of common hyperfunctional voice disorders."", 'TITLE: Estimation of Subglottal Pressure, Vocal Fold Collision Pressure, and Intrinsic Laryngeal Muscle Activation From Neck-Surface Vibration Using a Neural Network Framework and a Voice Production Model | KEYWORDS: ambulatory monitoring; clinical voice assessment; neck-surface accelerometer; neural networks; subglottal pressure estimation; voice production model | ABSTRACT: The ambulatory assessment of vocal function can be significantly enhanced by having access to physiologically based features that describe underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in individuals with voice disorders. This type of enhancement can improve methods for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of behaviorally based voice disorders. Unfortunately, the direct measurement of important vocal features such as subglottal pressure, vocal fold collision pressure, and laryngeal muscle activation is impractical in laboratory and ambulatory settings. In this study, we introduce a method to estimate these features during phonation from a neck-surface vibration signal through a framework that integrates a physiologically relevant model of voice production and machine learning tools. The signal from a neck-surface accelerometer is first processed using subglottal impedance-based inverse filtering to yield an estimate of the unsteady glottal airflow. Seven aerodynamic and acoustic features are extracted from the neck surface accelerometer and an optional microphone signal. A neural network architecture is selected to provide a mapping between the seven input features and subglottal pressure, vocal fold collision pressure, and cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid muscle activation. This non-linear mapping is trained solely with 13,000 Monte Carlo simulations of a voice production model that utilizes a symmetric triangular body-cover model of the vocal folds. The performance of the method was compared against laboratory data from synchronous recordings of oral airflow, intraoral pressure, microphone, and neck-surface vibration in 79 vocally healthy female participants uttering consecutive /pæ/ syllable strings at comfortable, loud, and soft levels. The mean absolute error and root-mean-square error for estimating the mean subglottal pressure were 191 Pa (1.95 cm H2O) and 243 Pa (2.48 cm H2O), respectively, which are comparable with previous studies but with the key advantage of not requiring subject-specific training and yielding more output measures. The validation of vocal fold collision pressure and laryngeal muscle activation was performed with synthetic values as reference. These initial results provide valuable insight for further vocal fold model refinement and constitute a proof of concept that the proposed machine learning method is a feasible option for providing physiologically relevant measures for laboratory and ambulatory assessment of vocal function.']"

In this study, we describe the contribution of immune cells producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) to the systemic infection caused by S. Typhimurium in mice. We observed that the production of IL-10 was required by S. Typhimurium to cause a systemic disease, since mice lacking IL-10 (IL-10-/-) were significantly more resistant to die after an infection as compared to wild-type (WT) mice. IL-10-/- mice had reduced bacterial loads in internal organs and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum at 5 days of infection. Importantly, WT mice showed high bacterial loads in tissues and no increase of cytokines in serum after 5 days of S. Typhimurium infection, except for IL-10. In WT mice, we observed a peak of il-10 messenger RNA production in ileum, spleen, and liver after 5 days of infection. Importantly, the adoptive transfer of T or B cells from WT mice restored the susceptibility of IL-10-/- mice to systemic S.

Nikiforov in [35] suggested the study of the convex linear combination Aα (α-adjacency matrix), Aα(G)=αD(G)+(1−α)A(G) for α∈[0,1], where A(G) and D(G) are the adjacency and the diagonal vertex degrees matrices of G, respectively.

This matrix is designated the (a,b)-adjacency matrix of G. Both adjacency matrices are examples of universal matrices already studied by W. Haemers. In this paper, we study the (a,b)-adjacency spectra for a family of compound graphs formed by disjoint balanced trees whose roots are identified to the vertices of a given graph. In consequence, new families of cospectral (adjacency, Laplacian and signless Laplacian) graphs, new hypoenergetic graphs (graphs whose energy is less than its vertex number) and new explicit formulae for Estrada, signless Laplacian Estrada and Laplacian Estrada indices of graphs were obtained.

Other archaeological records have been mentioned occasionally and anecdotally. Investigations carried out from 2006 onwards in the highlands of this region, have sought to address other social dynamics of these hunter-gatherer groups beyond their subsistence, in order to discuss other aspects of their mobility. In this exploratory investigation, we focus on the chronological and contextual systematization of archaic ornamental and sumptuary objects, of local or allochthonous provenance, in the Precordillera (foothills) of northern Chile (2,800-3,800 masl). The presence of these objects, usually classified as ""miscellaneous"", found in ten sites with archaic occupations, allows us to account for the different mobility patterns of the highland Andean groups and their possible interaction with other specialized groups. They also allow us to discuss their role and importance in the shaping of different interaction and differentiation forms between individuals inside highland groups. Finally, we discuss the configuration and maintenance of social interactions materialized by the circulation of miscellaneous objects, and the necessary flow of information in the social dynamics established between the Archaic and Formative periods in the Central-South Andes region.', 'TITLE: The Dry Puna as an ecological megapatch and the peopling of South America: Technology, mobility, and the development of a late Pleistocene/early Holocene Andean hunter-gatherer tradition in northern Chile | KEYWORDS: Dry Puna; Early peopling of south America; High Andes; Late Pleistocene; Megapatch; South central Andean Archaic | ABSTRACT: Current scientific evidence shows that humans colonized South America at least 15,000 years ago, but there are still many unknown aspects of this process, including the major and minor migratory routes involved, and the pattern of successive occupation of a diverse continental mosaic of ecosystems. In this context, the role of the Andean highlands (≥3400 meters above sea level) has been neglected, because of the supposedly harsh conditions for humans including hypoxia and cold climate. Nevertheless, the environmental and cultural resources available in the high Andes constitutes an important “megapatch” that should be assessed in terms of human settlement patterns. We review the evidence for late Pleistocene/early Holocene hunter-gatherer occupation of one part of this megapatch, the northern Chilean Dry Puna, in its palaeoecological context. We focus on lithic technology, faunal remains, radiocarbon dates, and other archaeological materials related to different social activities, which allow us to suggest that groups of hunter-gatherers organized and adapted their way of life to highland ecosystems through logistical mobility, and curatorial strategies for lithic tool kits that included projectile points and other formalized tools. The morphology and technological processes involved are recognized over vast territories along the high Andes. We identify this material expression as the high south central Andean Archaic hunter-gatherer tradition, which also featured long distance mobile settlement systems and communication processes over this broad and distinct megapatch. More speculatively, we outline the hypothesis that these highland ecosystems constituted a suitable migratory route that may have been key for the early peopling of the continent, and contrast it with the alternative hypothesis of the initially secondary and seasonally intermittent exploitation of this habitat by hunter-gatherers dispersing along the Pacific coastal corridor.', 'TITLE: Instrasite study of an archaic settlement with architecture on the coast of taltal, Atacama desert, northern Chile Estudio intrasitio de un yacimiento arcaico con arquitectura en la costa de taltal, desierto de atacama, norte de Chile | KEYWORDS: Atacama desert coast; Funerary architecture; Hunter gatherer fishers; Residential camp | ABSTRACT: The emergence and proliferation of domestic and funerary constructions on the Atacama Desert coast, which takes place for a short time of the pre-Hispanic period of the region (ca. 5700-4000 cal. BP), is a social process and architectural phenomenon that attracts much of the attention of the archaeological research of Northern Chile. To delve into the unique characteristics of this period, an intrasite study of the Caleta Bandurrias site (Taltal) is presented. The analysis of different lines of evidence suggests activities, subsistence patterns, and technological organization of local hunter gatherer fishers inhabiting the area. The results, and their subsequent analysis within a context of regional settlement, suggest a residential-funerary use and/or social aggregation function of the site, as well as a particular type of advance towards the coast through a residential mobility strategy based on the availability of local resources and built environment.']"

Based on a review of statistics, reports and specialized literature, various factors that contribute to the increase in irregular migration are identified, such as regional instability, Venezuelan displacement and its context of forced mobility. This paper focuses on three policies implemented in Chile: the restriction to change status within the country, the modifications to the visa system and the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The central hypothesis is that the measures adopted have not reduced irregularity, but rather have increased denunciations of entry through unauthorized passages, contributing to the precariousness of migrants and hindering their inclusion in Chilean society. Methodology: The methodology of the article is based on a qualitative documentary analysis, which systematically examines relevant documents to identify factors influencing the increase of irregular migration in Chile, using an analytical-synthetic approach to obtain a deep and broad understanding of the situation. Results: The study concludes that migration in Chile post-2018 faces challenges derived from regional and international factors, especially the Venezuelan diaspora. Chilean migration policies, including status restrictions and visa modifications, have increased the irregularity and vulnerability of migrants. In addition, the lack of comprehensive statistics on irregular migration is highlighted, which prevents a better understanding of migration dynamics, which subsequently has an impact on the precariousness of journeys.']"

The HIV-1 IRES requires IRES-transacting factors (ITAFs) for function. In this study, we evaluated the role of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) as a potential ITAF for the HIV-1 IRES. In HIV-1-expressing cells, the depletion of hnRNPK reduced HIV-1 vRNA translation. Furthermore, both the depletion and overexpression of hnRNPK modulated HIV-1 IRES activity. Phosphorylations and protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1)-induced asymmetrical dimethylation (aDMA) of hnRNPK strongly impacted the protein’s ability to promote the activity of the HIV-1 IRES. We also show that hnRNPK acts as an ITAF for the human T cell lymphotropic virus-type 1 (HTLV-1) IRES, present in the 5`UTR of the viral sense mRNA, but not for the IRES present in the antisense spliced transcript encoding the HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper protein (sHBZ).

As a corrective measure, environmental authorities established the Air Pollution Management Plan for Valdivia in 2017, seeking to decrease the effects on the population's health and provide a better quality of life for inhabitants. An alternative to reduce indoor air quality problems in homes is to implement a district heating plant. This study evaluated the air quality if a district heating plant is implemented in the zone. The WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ model was applied in August 2018 to simulate the effect of this new system on air quality. An adequate fit was achieved for the actual case between the 24-h average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 from the simulated and observed values, obtaining correlation factor (r) values of 0.76 and 0.78, respectively.

GMD causes mitochondrial dysfunction in the placental endothelium and trophoblast. Additionally, GDM is associated with reduced placental oxidative phosphorylation due to diminished activity of the mitochondrial F0F1-ATP synthase (complex V). This phenomenon may result from a higher generation of reactive superoxide anion and nitric oxide. Placental mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy work in concert to maintain cell homeostasis and are vital mechanisms securing the efficient generation of ATP, whose demand is higher in pregnancy, ensuring foetal growth and development. Additional factors disturbing placental ATP synthase activity in GDM include pre-gestational maternal obesity or overweight, intracellular pH, miRNAs, fatty acid oxidation, and foetal (and ‘placental’) sex. GDM is also associated with maternal and foetal hyperinsulinaemia, altered circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin, and the accumulation of extracellular adenosine. Here, we reviewed the potential interplay between these molecules or metabolic conditions on the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in the foeto-placental unit in GDM pregnancies.', 'TITLE: Kisspeptin signalling and its correlation with placental ultrastructure and clinical outcomes in pregnant South African women with obesity and gestational diabetes | KEYWORDS: fetus; gestational diabetes mellitus; KISS1R; kisspeptin; obesity; Placenta; pregnancy; syncytiotrophoblast extracellular vesicles | ABSTRACT: Introduction: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a major pregnancy metabolic disorder and is strongly linked with obesity. Kisspeptin is a hormone that increases several thousand-fold in the maternal circulation during human pregnancy, with placenta as its main source. Studies have suggested that kisspeptin regulates trophoblast invasion and promotes pancreatic insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Methods: In a well-characterized cohort of pregnant South African women and molecular and histological techniques, this study explored the impact and interaction of maternal obesity and GDM on kisspeptin (KISS1) signalling in relation to placental morphology and maternal and neonatal parameters. Results: We found that GDM had no effect on placental KISS1 and KISS1R (KISS1 receptor) mRNA and/or protein expression. However, obesity reduced placental KISS1R mRNA expression even though overall KISS1 protein abundance or localization was not different from the non-obese group. Maternal and cord circulating KISS1 concentrations did not vary with obesity or GDM, but maternal circulating KISS1 was positively correlated with placenta weight in non-GDM obese women, and negatively correlated with placental intervillous space volume in non-GDM non-obese women. Cord serum KISS1 was positively correlated with infant weight in GDM obese women, but negatively correlated with maternal BMI in the non-obese GDM group. Placental syncytiotrophoblast extracellular vesicles exhibited detectable KISS1 and its abundance was ∼50% lower in those from obese GDM compared to non-GDM women. Discussion: This study shows maternal obesity and GDM can modulate placental kisspeptin signalling and placental morphological development with potential pathophysiological implications for clinically-relevant pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.', 'TITLE: Obesity and gestational diabetes independently and collectively induce specific effects on placental structure, inflammation and endocrine function in a cohort of South African women | KEYWORDS: cytokine; fetus; gestational diabetes mellitus; inflammation; obesity; placenta; pregnancy | ABSTRACT: Abstract: Maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are associated with insulin resistance and health risks for mother and offspring. Obesity is also characterized by low-grade inflammation, which in turn, impacts insulin sensitivity. The placenta secretes inflammatory cytokines and hormones that influence maternal glucose and insulin handling. However, little is known about the effect of maternal obesity, GDM and their interaction, on placental morphology, hormones and inflammatory cytokines. In a South African cohort of non-obese and obese pregnant women with and without GDM, this study examined placental morphology using stereology, placental hormone and cytokine expression using real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry, and circulating TNFα and IL-6 concentrations using ELISA. Placental expression of endocrine and growth factor genes was not altered by obesity or GDM. However, LEPTIN gene expression was diminished, syncytiotrophoblast TNFα immunostaining elevated and stromal and fetal vessel IL-6 staining reduced in the placenta of obese women in a manner that was partly influenced by GDM status. Placental TNFα protein abundance and maternal circulating TNFα concentrations were reduced in GDM. Both maternal obesity and, to a lesser extent, GDM were accompanied by specific changes in placental morphometry. Maternal blood pressure and weight gain and infant ponderal index were also modified by obesity and/or GDM. Thus, obesity and GDM have specific impacts on placental morphology and endocrine and inflammatory states that may relate to pregnancy outcomes. These findings may contribute to developing placenta-targeted treatments that improve mother and offspring outcomes, which is particularly relevant given increasing rates of obesity and GDM worldwide. (Figure presented.). Key points: Rates of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes (GDM) are increasing worldwide, including in low-middle income countries (LMIC). Despite this, much of the work in the field is conducted in higher-income countries. In a well-characterised cohort of South African women, this study shows that obesity and GDM have specific impacts on placental structure, hormone production and inflammatory profile. Moreover, such placental changes were associated with pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in women who were obese and/or with GDM. The identification of specific changes in the placenta may help in the design of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to improve pregnancy and neonatal outcomes with particular significant benefit in LMICs.']"

It seems, in our foggy times, that everything that does not fit in sciences or the arts is named ""Philosophy"", without adding anything else. Now we live in a jumble of ""second philosophies"" in which we should ask if they really second something. We must return, therefore, to treat Philosophy as a first Philosophy. But we must do it in a radical and new way. That is why I will present what Philosophy is for Xavier Zubiri and I will argue that philosophy is a metaphysical knowledge of the physical things.', 'TITLE: Real realism as a frame of first philosophy to deal with the problem of god’s existence demonstration El realismo real como marco de una filosofía primera para abordar el problema de la demostración de la existencia de dios | KEYWORDS: New realism; Noology; Science-religion debate; Subject-object; X. Zubiri | ABSTRACT: The philosophical problem consisting in the «demonstration of God’s existence» has compeled us to show that the work of the Philosophy is to be first: it is not its purpose to find out how the different kinds of knowledge should be related to after the facts, but to notice how they share a common origin, before their separation: reality in its appearance. Therefore, we shall sketch the early stages of a Philosophy that we will call «Real Realism».The intent of such an approach is to attend the way in which things emerge: 1) to clarify what is it to appear, 2) to elucidate what reality is, 3) to show that reality appears in different modes, namely, existence, consistency and subsistence; 4) finally, to frame the question of God’s «existence» problem, according to these modes of reality. Such elucidations are, at the same time, an epigraph to the (here germinal) Real Realism.', ""TITLE: Perception and Pluralism: Leibniz's Theological Derivation of Perception in Connection with Platonism, Rationalism and Substance Monism | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This article discusses Leibniz's claim that every substance is endowed with the property of perception in connection with Platonism, rationalism and the problem of substance monism. It is argued that Leibniz's ascription of perception to every substance relies on his Platonic conception of finite things as imitations of God, in whom there is 'infinite perception'. Leibniz's Platonism, however, goes beyond the notion of imitation, including also the emanative causal relation and the logical (i.e. definitional) priority of the absolute over the limited. It is proposed that Leibniz's endorsement of Platonism, in conjunction with some rationalist elements of his philosophy, implies a monistic conception of particulars as modifications of a single substance. Following some scholars and opposing others, the article offers evidence that Leibniz accepted this implication during the last years of his Paris period. However, it is further argued that it was precisely the idea of perception as a property of every substance that allowed Leibniz to find a way out of monism after that period. More specifically, the article defends the view that what made room for ontological pluralism within Leibniz's rationalist and Platonic outlook was the idea that perception is the property which constitutes the very being of substances: substances are their perceptions.""]"

The smoke originated from the record-breaking bushfires in Australia. The stratospheric aerosol optical thickness reached values up to 0.85 at 532 nm in mid- January 2020. The main goal of this rapid communication letter is to provide first stratospheric measurements of smoke extinction-to-backscatter ratios (lidar ratios) and particle linear depolarization ratios at 355 and 532 nm wavelengths. These aerosol parameters are important input parameters in the analysis of spaceborne CALIPSO and Aeolus lidar observations of the Australian smoke spreading over large parts of the Southern Hemisphere in January and February 2020 up to heights of around 30 km. Lidar and depolarization ratios, simultaneously measured at 355 and 532 nm, are of key importance regarding the homogenization of the overall Aeolus (355 nm wavelength) and CALIPSO (532 nm wavelength) lidar data sets documenting the spread of the smoke and the decay of the stratospheric perturbation, which will be observable over the entire year of 2020. We found typical values and spectral dependencies of the lidar ratio and linear depolarization ratio for aged stratospheric smoke. At 355 nm, the lidar ratio and depolarization ratio ranged from 53 to 97 sr (mean 71 sr) and 0.2 to 0.26 (mean 0.23), respectively. At 532 nm, the lidar ratios were higher (75-112 sr, mean 97 sr) and the depolarization ratios were lower with values of 0.14- 0.22 (mean 0.18). The determined depolarization ratios for aged Australian smoke are in very good agreement with respective ones for aged Canadian smoke, observed with lidar in stratospheric smoke layers over central Europe in the summer of 2017. The much higher 532 nm lidar ratios, however, indicate stronger absorption by the Australian smoke particles.', 'TITLE: Australian wildfire smoke in the stratosphere: The decay phase in 2020/2021 and impact on ozone depletion | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Record-breaking wildfires raged in southeastern Australia in late December 2019 and early January 2020. Rather strong pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) convection developed over the fire areas and lofted enormous amounts of biomass burning smoke into the tropopause region and caused the strongest wildfire-related stratospheric aerosol perturbation ever observed around the globe. We discuss the geometrical, optical, and microphysical properties of the stratospheric smoke layers and the decay of this major stratospheric perturbation. A multiwavelength polarization Raman lidar at Punta Arenas (53.2°S, 70.9°W), southern Chile, and an elastic backscatter Raman lidar at Río Grande (53.8°S, 67.7°W) in southern Argentina, were operated to monitor the major record-breaking event until the end of 2021. These lidar measurements can be regarded as representative for mid to high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. A unique dynamical feature, an anticyclonic, smoke-filled vortex with 1000 km horizontal width and 5 km vertical extent, which ascended by about 500 m d-1, was observed over the full last week of January 2020. The key results of the long-term study are as follows. The smoke layers extended, on average, from 9 to 24 km in height. The smoke partly ascended to more than 30 km height as a result of self-lofting processes. Clear signs of a smoke impact on the record-breaking ozone hole over Antarctica in September-November 2020 were found. A slow decay of the stratospheric perturbation detected by means of the 532 nm aerosol optical thickness (AOT) yielded an e-folding decay time of 19-20 months. The maximum smoke AOT was around 1.0 over Punta Arenas in January 2020 and thus 2 to 3 orders of magnitude above the stratospheric aerosol background of 0.005. After 2 months with strongly varying smoke conditions, the 532 nm AOT decreased to 0.03-0.06 from March-December 2020 and to 0.015-0.03 throughout 2021. The particle extinction coefficients at 532 nm were in the range of 10-75 Mm-1 in January 2020 and, later on, mostly between 1 and 5 Mm-1. Combined lidar-photometer retrievals revealed typical smoke extinction-to-backscatter ratios of 69 ± 19 sr (at 355 nm), 91 ± 17 sr (at 532 nm), and 120 ± 22 sr (at 1064 nm).

The expedition lasted from September 2019 to October 2020 and measurements were mostly taken between 85 and 88.5ggN. The lidar was integrated into a complex remote-sensing infrastructure aboard the Polarstern. In this article, novel lidar techniques, innovative concepts to study aerosol-cloud interaction in the Arctic, and unique MOSAiC findings will be presented. The highlight of the lidar measurements was the detection of a 10gkm deep wildfire smoke layer over the North Pole region between 7-8gkm and 17-18gkm height with an aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 532gnm of around 0.1 (in October-November 2019) and 0.05 from December to March. The dual-wavelength Raman lidar technique allowed us to unambiguously identify smoke as the dominating aerosol type in the aerosol layer in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). An additional contribution to the 532gnm AOT by volcanic sulfate aerosol (Raikoke eruption) was estimated to always be lower than 15g%. The optical and microphysical properties of the UTLS smoke layer are presented in an accompanying paper . This smoke event offered the unique opportunity to study the influence of organic aerosol particles (serving as ice-nucleating particles, INPs) on cirrus formation in the upper troposphere. An example of a closure study is presented to explain our concept of investigating aerosol-cloud interaction in this field. The smoke particles were obviously able to control the evolution of the cirrus system and caused low ice crystal number concentration. After the discussion of two typical Arctic haze events, we present a case study of the evolution of a long-lasting mixed-phase cloud layer embedded in Arctic haze in the free troposphere. The recently introduced dual-field-of-view polarization lidar technique was applied, for the first time, to mixed-phase cloud observations in order to determine the microphysical properties of the water droplets. The mixed-phase cloud closure experiment (based on combined lidar and radar observations) indicated that the observed aerosol levels controlled the number concentrations of nucleated droplets and ice crystals.']"

Afterwards, diluted sulfuric acid (DSA) hydrolysis and EW treatments have been compared in terms of energy consumption and yield of a cellulosic solid residue able to be enzymatically hydrolyzed to glucose. Experimental results show that temperature is the only variable of EW with a significant effect on the quality of the pretreated solids. EW pre-treatment of wheat straw is more effective than DSA hydrolysis due to its higher capacity of delignification. Moreover, a high glucose yield (80%) can be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of a solid pretreated with a moderate energy input EW (160 °C, 45 min) while wheat straw needs of a higher energy input during DSA to produce a similar yield of glucose after saccharification.', 'TITLE: Biohydrogen production by dark fermentation: scaling-up and technologies integration for a sustainable system | KEYWORDS: Biohydrogen; Biohythane; Dark fermentation; Pilot plant | ABSTRACT: Currently, the use of alternative renewable energies is broadly supported in many countries, some of which are seriously evaluating the possibility of using hydrogen as an alternative fuel in their power systems. Hydrogen production by biological processes, such as dark fermentation, is a very promising alternative. However, this process has only been studied on the laboratory scale, and there is limited experience at the pilot scale. The main reasons of non-scaling hydrogen production by dark fermentation at large scale are unpurified hydrogen production, stability of the bioprocesses, as well as their low conversion yields joined at the formation of byproducts. Improvement of energetic yields of dark fermentation requires a better knowledge of the microorganisms involved in the mixed culture and their possible interactions, as well as the use of appropriate substrates and strategies, such as solid-state fermentation, the purification of hydrogen and the coupling of dark fermentation with other biological processes as anaerobic digestion. The present work offers an overview of the current knowledge dealing with H2-production by dark fermentation and its integration into a concept of an environmental biorefinery. Several key points are addressed, such as the benefits of using local waste as substrates, the new solid-state fermentation processes, the coupling of hydrogen purification with the production process, the association of the H2-producing process with other biological processes, such as anaerobic digestion towards biohythane production (H2/CH4). Information about pilot plant experiments was added to illustrate the feasibility of producing fermentative hydrogen and methane from organic waste at a pilot scale, as developed at Feng Chia University (Taiwan).', 'TITLE: Glucose electro-fermentation as main driver for efficient H2-producing bacteria selection in mixed cultures | KEYWORDS: Bio-electrochemical system (BES); Biohydrogen; Dark fermentation; Microbial consortium; Oxidation reduction potential (ORP) | ABSTRACT: Electro-fermentation has been recently proposed as a new operational mode of bioprocess control using polarized electrodes. This paper aims to evaluate how polarized electrodes are affecting microbial metabolic fermentative pathways, with a special focus on how the bacterial populations are affected during hydrogen production by dark fermentation. Four different potentials were applied on the working electrode in batch electro-fermentation tests operated with mixed culture and using glucose as a substrate. Two different metabolic behaviours for H2 production were observed in electro-fermentation. The first one led to a higher H2 production compared to conventional fermentation with a strong selection of Clostridium sp. The second behaviour led to lower H2 production along with ethanol, and strongly correlated with the selection of Escherichia and Enterobacter genera. However, the effect of the applied potential on population selection was mostly non-linear and no simple relationship was found between these two parameters. Overall, electro-fermentation process has shown its potential as a new type of control for mixed-culture bioprocesses with significant effects of polarized electrodes on glucose fermentation.']"

The condensation-cyclization reaction of organometallic-cyanide with the corresponding thiosemicarbazide produces the ferrocenyl-TDZs (3a-c) and cyrhetrenyl analogues (4ac). The structures of all products were inferred from their elemental analysis, 1H and 13C NMR spectra and MS. The molecular structures of 3b and 4b were confirmed using X-ray crystallography. The electronic effects of cyrhetrenyl (4a-c) and ferrocenyl (3a-c) bound directly to the thiadiazole ring have been correlated with the chemical shift of the exocyclic amine proton and 13C shift of the carbon at the 5-position. The X-ray crystal structure of 3b and 4b indicates that the rhenium compound 4b possesses a more extensive conjugated π-system.

All the compounds were characterized by conventional spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry). The proposed molecular structures of 2a and 3a were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography.

The series have the (E)-2-((1-(R)-3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)diazenyl)phenol general structure and were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, UV–Vis, FTIR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and two-dimensional NMR experiments. This experimental characterization was complemented by DFT simulations. A deep insight regarding molecular reactivity was accomplished employing a conceptual DFT approach. In this sense, dual descriptors were calculated at HF and DFT level of theory and GGV spin-density Fukui functions. The main reactive region within the molecules was mapped through isosurface and condensed representations. Finally, chemical descriptors that have previously shown to be close related to biological activity were compared within the series.

Sexismo en Educación Superior: ¿Cómo se Reproduce la Inequidad de Género en el contexto Universitario? | KEYWORDS: gender; gender stereotypes; higher education; sexism | ABSTRACT: In Chile, as in many countries in the world, there are manifestations of gender inequality in education, which undermines everyone’s learning and development. In addition to structural factors, there are psychosocial ones such as gender stereotypes and sexist pedagogical practices that are reproduced in education and contribute to maintaining gaps in attitudes towards learning and achievement. Two studies were carried out to explore whether university students (Study 1) and teachers (Study 2) present gender stereotypes and sexist pedagogical practices. In addition, differences between groups were explored, as well as the effect of stereotypes on students’ attitudes and teaching practices. Self-report questionnaires were used to measure motivation and academic self-concept regarding career, causal attributions, explicit gender stereotypes, and sexist pedagogical practices. 297 students and 85 teachers from a Chilean public university participated. The analysis reveals gender stereotypes in students and teachers, especially in men and in students who attribute greater importance to being masculine. In addition, women and students who attach more importance to being feminine value more effort and academic achievement. The results also reveal that for women—but not for met—the importance attributed to being feminine is a positive predictor of academic self-concept. Finally, that teachers’ gender stereotypes predict their sexist pedagogical practices. The findings are discussed regarding the implications for the teaching-learning processes in higher education and for initiatives that seek greater gender equity.', 'TITLE: Gender gap in STEM pathways: the role of secondary curricula in a highly differentiated school system—the case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Gender differences; Higher education; STEM pipeline; Vocational education | ABSTRACT: Background: STEM fields are instrumental in increasing the technological and innovative capacity of the economy.

Results: Our results reveal that upper-secondary tracks connected to STEM courses are positively associated with enrollment in STEM higher education and, to some degree, persistence. More specifically, exposure to STEM courses in the academic track is the most effective path to boost chances of enrolling in STEM university programs but has no connection to later persistence.

There is a lack of information on the composition of the outermost exosporium layer of C. difficile spores. Using recently developed exosporium removal methods combined with MS/MS, we have established a gel-free approach to analyze the proteome of the exosporium of C. difficile spores of strain 630. A total of 184 proteins were found in the exosporium layer of C. difficile spores. We identified 7 characterized spore coat and/or exosporium proteins; 6 proteins likely to be involved in spore resistance; 6 proteins possibly involved in pathogenicity; 13 uncharacterized proteins; and 146 cytosolic proteins that might have been encased into the exosporium during assembly, similarly as reported for Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus spores. We demonstrate through Flag-fusions that CotA and CotB are mainly located in the spore coat, while the exosporium collagen-like glycoproteins (i.e. BclA1, BclA2 and BclA3), the exosporium morphogenetic proteins CdeC and CdeM, and the uncharacterized exosporium proteins CdeA and CdeB are mainly located in the exosporium layer of C. difficile 630 spores.

Biological significance: This study offers a novel strategy to identify proteins of the exosporium layer of C. difficile spores and complements previous proteomic studies on the entire C. difficile spores and spore coat since it defines the proteome of the outermost layer of C. difficile spores, the exosporium. This study suggests that C. difficile spores have several proteins involved in protection against environmental stress as well as putative virulence factors that might play a role during infection.

By means of two-dimensional gas+dust hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with three-dimensional dust radiative transfer calculations, we show that the spirals in scattered light, the eccentric, asymmetric ring and the crescent-shaped structure in the (sub)millimetre can all be caused by two giant planets: a 1.5-Jupiter mass planet at 35 au (inside the spirals) and a 5-Jupiter mass planet at 140 au (outside the spirals). The outer planet forms a dust-trapping vortex at the inner edge of its gap (at ∼85 au), and the continuum emission of this dust trap reproduces the ALMA and VLA observations well. The outer planet triggers several spiral arms that are similar to those observed in polarized scattered light. The inner planet also forms a vortex at the outer edge of its gap (at ∼50 au), but it decays faster than the vortex induced by the outer planet, as a result of the disc's turbulent viscosity. The vortex decay can explain the eccentric inner ring seen with ALMA as well as the low signal and larger azimuthal spread of this dust trap in VLA observations. Finding the thermal and kinematic signatures of both giant planets could verify the proposed scenario."", 'TITLE: MINDS: JWST/NIRCam imaging of the protoplanetary disk PDS 70 A spiral accretion stream and a potential third protoplanet | KEYWORDS: planet-disk interactions; planets and satellites: detection; planets and satellites: formation; planets and satellites: gaseous planets; protoplanetary disks | ABSTRACT: Context. Two protoplanets have recently been discovered within the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk. JWST/NIRCam offers a unique opportunity to characterize them and their birth environment at wavelengths that are difficult to access from the ground. Aims. We image the circumstellar environment of PDS 70 at 1.87 µm and 4.83 µm, assess the presence of Pa-α emission due to accretion onto the protoplanets, and probe any IR excess indicative of heated circumplanetary material. Methods. We obtained noncoronagraphic JWST/NIRCam images of PDS 70 within the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) program. We leveraged the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) package for data reduction, and we developed dedicated routines for optimal stellar point spread function subtraction, unbiased imaging of the disk, and protoplanet flux measurement in this type of dataset. A radiative transfer model of the disk was used to separate the contributions from the disk and the protoplanets. Results. We redetect both protoplanets and identify extended emission after subtracting a disk model, including a large-scale spiral-like feature. We interpret its signal in the direct vicinity of planet c as tracing the accretion stream that feeds its circumplanetary disk, while the outer part of the feature may rather reflect asymmetric illumination of the outer disk. We also report a bright signal that is consistent with a previously proposed protoplanet candidate enshrouded in dust near the 1:2:4 mean-motion resonance with planets b and c. The 1.87 µm flux of planet b is consistent with atmospheric model predictions, but the flux of planet c is not. We discuss potential origins for this discrepancy, including significant Pa-α line emission. The 4.83 µm fluxes of planets b and c suggest enshrouding dust or heated CO emission from their circumplanetary environment. Conclusions. The use of image-processing methods that are optimized for extended disk signals on high-sensitivity and high-stability from JWST can uniquely identify signatures of planet–disk interactions and enable accurate photometry of protoplanets at wavelengths that are difficult to probe from the ground. Our results indicate that more protoplanets can be identified and characterized in other JWST datasets.', 'TITLE: Hints of Planet Formation Signatures in a Large-cavity Disk Studied in the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form.

Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of ∼150 mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at 0.″57 (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.″24 (31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to 3σ) of a compact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of ∼2.7−12.9 Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure) through several 12CO channel maps (angular resolution ∼200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of ∼0.″875 (115.6 au). After modeling the 12CO velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a purple tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk and their potential connection to signatures of planet formation.']"

If BESS are used as the main energy source, then it is required to include adequate procedures for the estimation of critical variables such as the State of Charge (SoC) and the State of Health (SoH) in the design of Battery Management Systems (BMS). Furthermore, in applications where batteries are exposed to high charge and discharge rates it is also desirable to estimate the State of Maximum Power Available (SoMPA). In this regard, this paper presents a novel approach to the estimation of SoMPA in Lithium-Ion batteries. This method formulates an optimisation problem for the battery power based on a non-linear dynamic model, where the resulting solutions are functions of the SoC. In the battery model, the polarisation resistance is modelled using fuzzy rules that are function of both SoC and the discharge (charge) current. Particle filtering algorithms are used as an online estimation technique, mainly because these algorithms allow approximating the probability density functions of the SoC and SoMPA even in the case of non-Gaussian sources of uncertainty. The proposed method for SoMPA estimation is validated using the experimental data obtained from an experimental setup designed for charging and discharging the Lithium-Ion batteries.', 'TITLE: Characterization of the degradation process of lithium-ion batteries when discharged at different current rates | KEYWORDS: degradation model; different discharge current rates; lithium-ion batteries; State of health | ABSTRACT: The use of energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries, has become popular in many different domains and applications. Hence, it is relatively easy to find literature associated with problems of battery state-of-charge estimation and energy autonomy prognostics. Despite this fact, the characterization of battery degradation processes is still a matter of ongoing research. Indeed, most battery degradation models solely consider operation under nominal (or strictly controlled) conditions, although actual operating profiles (including discharge current) may differ significantly from those. In this context, this article proposes a lithium-ion battery degradation model that incorporates the impact of arbitrary discharge currents.

Hence, it is relatively easy to find literature associated with problems of battery state-of-charge estimation and energy autonomy prognostics. Despite this fact, the characterization of battery degradation processes is still a matter of ongoing research. Indeed, most battery degradation models solely consider operation under nominal (or strictly controlled) conditions, although actual operating profiles (including discharge current) may differ significantly from those. In this context, this article proposes a lithium-ion battery degradation model that incorporates the impact of arbitrary discharge currents. Also, the proposed model, initially calibrated through data reported for a specific lithium-ion battery type, can characterize degradation curves for other lithium-ion batteries. Two case studies have been carried out to validate the proposed model, initially calibrated by using data from a Sony battery. The first case study uses our own experimental data obtained for a Panasonic lithium-ion cell, which was cycled and degraded at high current rates.

Empirical constraints on non-linear period changes | KEYWORDS: Stars: general; Stars: oscillations; Stars: variables: Cepheids | ABSTRACT: Context. Classical Cepheids are not only excellent standard candles, but also invaluable tools to test stellar evolution and pulsation theories. Rates of their pulsation period change, quantified usually through O-C diagrams, can be confronted with predictions of stellar evolution theory. On the other hand, period changes on much shorter time scales (∼102-104 days), attributed to non-evolutionary effects are often detected and lack detailed explanation. Aims. We aim to provide a systematic and quantitative description of irregular or non-linear period changes in Cepheids. Such a study is crucial for a complete understanding of period changes in Cepheids and is key to decoupling the evolutionary aspects from the non-evolutionary ones. Methods. We analysed part of the OGLE data for classical Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs; from both Large Magellanic Cloud, LMC, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC) using the modified Hertzsprung O-C technique. A sample of 3658 stars, with the best quality data and void of additional low-amplitude periodicities (e.g. due to non-radial pulsations), that could impact the results, was selected for analysis. Based on O-C shapes, stars were classified into three categories: no period change (class 1), linear period change (class 2), and irregular change (class 3). The Eddington-Plakidis test, wavelet analysis, Stetson index, and instantaneous period method were used to characterise class 3 candidates. We also investigated the correlation between the irregular period change in Cepheids and their metallicity environment Results. In our investigation, 33.5 ± 0.7% of analysed stars show irregular period changes. Considering the pulsation mode, irregular period changes were detected in 16.5 ± 0.7% of the analysed fundamental mode stars and in 68.1-± 1.2% of the first overtone stars. The amplitude of variability in the O-C diagrams increases with the pulsation period, and at a given pulsation period, it is larger for first overtone stars. While the increase is linear for first overtone stars, for fundamental mode stars it becomes steeper as the pulsation period increases. Time scales of the observed variability range from a few hundred to a few thousand days. Conclusions. Irregular period changes are a ubiquitous property of classical Cepheids and may impact the derivation of secular, evolutionary period change rates; hence their quantitative characterisation is essential. The nature of these changes is still unknown. Our research provides observational constraints on their modelling. The markedly higher frequency of irregular period variations in first overtone Cepheids is a key observation that must be accounted for by the models.', 'TITLE: On the modulation of rr lyrae stars in the globular cluster M3 | KEYWORDS: Globular clusters: individual (Messier 3); stars: horizontal-branch; stars: oscillations; stars: variables: RR Lyrae | ABSTRACT: New, extended time-series photometry of M3 RR Lyrae stars has revealed that 4 of the 10 double-mode stars show large-amplitude Blazhko modulation of both radial modes. The first, detailed analysis of the peculiar behavior of the unique, Blazhko RRd stars is given. While the P1/P0 period ratio is normal, and the overtone mode is dominant in the other RRd stars of the cluster, the period ratio is anomalous and the fundamental mode has a larger (or similar) mean amplitude than the overtone has in Blazhko RRd stars. The modulations of the fundamental and overtone modes are synchronized only in one of the Blazhko RRd stars. No evidence of any connection between the modulations of the modes in the other three stars is found. The Blazhko modulation accounts, at least partly, for the previously reported amplitude and period changes of these stars. Contrary to the 50% Blazhko statistics of RRab and RRd stars, Blazhko modulation occurs only in 10% of the overtone variables in M3. Four of the five Blazhko RRc stars are bright, evolved objects, and one has a period and brightness similar to those of Blazhko RRd stars. The regions of the instability strip with high and low occurrence rates of the Blazhko modulation overlap with the regions populated by first- and second-generation stars according to theoretical and observational studies, raising up the possibility that the Blazhko modulation occurs preferentially in first-generation RR Lyrae stars.', 'TITLE: Photometric and radial-velocity time series of RR Lyrae stars in M3: Analysis of single-mode variables | KEYWORDS: Globular clusters: individual: M3; Stars: horizontal branch; Stars: oscillations (including pulsations); Stars: variables: RR Lyrae; Techniques: photometric; Techniques: radial velocities | ABSTRACT: We present the first simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic investigation of a large set of RR Lyrae variables in a globular cluster. The radial-velocity (RV) data presented comprise the largest sample of RVs of RR Lyrae stars ever obtained. The target is M3; BVIC time series of 111 and b flux data of further 64 RRab stars and RV data of 79 RR Lyrae stars are published. Blazhko modulation of the light curves of 47 per cent of the RRab stars is detected. The mean value of the centre-of-mass velocities of RR Lyrae stars is −146.8 km s−1 with 4.52 km s−1 standard deviation, which is in good agreement with the results obtained for the red giants of the cluster. The Φ21RV phase difference of the RV curves of RRab stars is found to be uniformly constant both for the M3 and for Galactic field RRab stars; no period or metallicity dependence of the Φ21RV is detected. The Baade-Wesselink distances of 26 non-Blazhko variables with the best phase-coverage RV curves are determined; the corresponding distance of the cluster, 10 480 ± 210 pc, agrees with the previous literature information. A quadratic formula for the Apuls − AV relation of RRab stars is given, which is valid for both OoI and OoII variables. We also show that (V − I)0 of RRab stars measured at light minimum is period dependent; there is at least 0.1 mag difference between the colours at minimum light of the shortest and longest period variables.']"

The n-3 PUFA, such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, would be hepatoprotective against the development of NAFLD by stimulating lipolysis and inhibit lipogenesis. So, fish oil supplementation (EPA + DHA) prevents HFD-induced NAFLD. In this context, the aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between liver oxidative stress with IR and levels of PUFA in supplemented mice. Male mice C57BL/6J (n=9) were fed for 12th week: a) control diet (20% protein, 70% carbohydrate, 10% lipids), b) control diet and fish oil supplementation (200 mg EPA+DHA/kg/day), c) high fat diet (20% protein, 20% carbohydrate, 60% lipids), and d) high fat diet and fish oil supplementation. Liver steatosis (histology), insulin resistance (HOMA), liver oxidative stress (GSH/GSSG, carbonyl protein and 8-isoprostanes) and liver fatty acid content were evaluated. The significant decrease in liver oxidative stress parameters (p<0.05, ANOVA followed by Newman Keuls test) were correlated (Pearson test) with HOMA and levels of PUFA, along with the hepatoprotection observed. It concludes that prevention of NAFLD by supplementation with fish oil (EPA+DHA) is dependent of the prevention of liver oxidative stress, IR and PUFA depletion.', 'TITLE: High-fat diet induces mouse liver steatosis with a concomitant decline in energy metabolism: Attenuation by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or hydroxytyrosol (HT) supplementation and the additive effects upon EPA and HT co-administration | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: High-fat-diet (HFD) feeding is associated with liver oxidative stress (OS), n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) depletion, hepatic steatosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that the HFD-induced liver injury can be attenuated by the combined supplementation of n-3 LCPUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol (HT). The C57BL/6J mice were administered an HFD (60% fat, 20% protein, 20% carbohydrates) or control diet (CD; 10% fat, 20% protein, 70% carbohydrates), with or without EPA (50 mg kg-1 day-1), HT (5 mg kg-1 day-1), or EPA + HT (50 and 5 mg kg-1 day-1, respectively) for 12 weeks. We measured the body and liver weights and dietary and energy intakes along with liver histology, FA composition, steatosis score and associated transcription factors, mitochondrial functions and metabolic factors related to energy sensing through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and PPAR-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) cascade. It was found that the HFD significantly induced liver steatosis, with a 66% depletion of n-3 LCPUFAs and a 100% increase in n-6/n-3 LCPUFA ratio as compared to the case of CD (p < 0.05). These changes were concomitant with (i) a 95% higher lipogenic and 70% lower FA oxidation signaling, (ii) a 40% diminution in mitochondrial respiratory capacity and (iii) a 56% lower ATP content. HFD-induced liver steatosis was also associated with (iv) a depressed mRNA expression of AMPK-PGC-1α signaling components, nuclear respiratory factor-2 (NRF-2) and β-ATP synthase. These HFD effects were significantly attenuated by the combined EPA + HT supplementation in an additive manner. These results suggested that EPA and HT co-administration partly prevented HFD-induced liver steatosis, thus strengthening the importance of combined interventions in hepatoprotection in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.', 'TITLE: Reversal of high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis by n-3 LCPUFA: Role of PPAR-α and SREBP-1c | KEYWORDS: High fat diet; Liver steatosis; N-3 Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid; PPAR-α; SREBP-1c | ABSTRACT: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of triacylglycerides in the liver in absence of significant alcohol consumption. Under these conditions, it has been observed an impaired bioavailability of hepatic n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). The aim of this study was to test the reversion of the prosteatotic and proinflammatory effects of high-fat diet (HFD) in the mouse liver by changing to normocaloric diet and n-3 LCPUFA supplementation. Male C57BL/6J mice were given either control diet (CD) or HFD for 12 weeks. Control and HFD groups were divided into subgroups that continue with CD or subjected to CD plus n-3 LCPUFA for 8 additional weeks. After this time, blood and liver samples were taken and metabolic, morphologic, oxidative stress, inflammatory and signaling parameters were analyzed. The dietary change from HFD to a normocaloric diet with n-3 LCPUFA supplementation significantly reduced insulin resistance and liver steatosis when compared to switching HFD to normocaloric diet alone. In addition, HFD-induced increases in adiposity, adipocyte enlargement and liver oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine expression were suppressed by n-3 LCPUFA to control values. Importantly, n-3 LCPUFA supplementation abolish HFD-induced enhancement in hepatic SREBP-1c/PPAR-α ratios, suggesting a change in the metabolic status of the liver from a lipogenic condition to one favoring fatty acid oxidation and steatosis attenuation. These findings may provide the rational basis for the use of normocaloric diets supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA in patients with liver steatosis. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.']"

Oral squamous cell carcinoma is very aggressive, as most patients die after 3 to 5 years post-diagnosis. The initiation and progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma are multifactorial: smoking, alcohol consumption, and human papilloma virus infection are among the causes that promote its development. Although oral squamous cell carcinoma involves abnormal growth and migration of oral epithelial cells, other cell types such as fibroblasts and immune cells form the carcinoma niche. An underlying inflammatory state within the oral tissue promotes differential stress-related responses that favor oral squamous cell carcinoma. Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process that allows cancer cells to survive under stress conditions. Autophagy degrades cellular components by sequestering them in vesicles called autophagosomes, which ultimately fuse with lysosomes. Although several autophagy markers have been associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma, it remains unclear whether up- or down-regulation of autophagy favors its progression. Autophagy levels during oral squamous cell carcinoma are both timing- and cell-specific. Here we discuss how autophagy is required to establish a new cellular microenvironment in oral squamous cell carcinoma and how autophagy drives the phenotypic change of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells by promoting crosstalk between carcinoma cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells.', 'TITLE: Essentials of oral cancer | KEYWORDS: Carcinogenesis; Mouth neoplasms; Neoplasm staging; Oral cancer; Oral squamous cell carcinoma; Tumor microenvironment | ABSTRACT: Oral cancer is one of the 10 most common cancers in the world, with a delayed clinical detection, poor prognosis, without specific biomarkers for the disease and expensive therapeutic alternatives.

Oral carcinogenesis is a multistage process, which simultaneously involves precancerous lesions, invasion and metastasis. Degradation of the cell cycle and the proliferation of malignant cells results in the loss of control mechanisms that ensure the normal function of tissues. The aim of the current review is to present the histopathological features of OSCC, including potentially malignant changes, the international classification of tumors, the tumor invasion front and tumor biomarkers (Ki-67, p53, homeobox genes and collagen type IV), as well as the tumor microenvironment and function of cancer-associated fibroblasts in the most common type of oral cancer that is encountered by dental surgeons. In OSCC, associations have been identified between the proliferation, basal lamina degradation and connective tissue modulation. Therefore, the comparison of these factors with the survival time of OSCC patients from the histopathological diagnosis is of interest.']"

Among direct ways to moderate CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, one option is to meet the electricity demand in a clean and environmentally friendly way, such as using solar energy. Intermittence and instability of solar energy could be solved by linking this technology with thermal energy storage (TES) systems, which can be classified as sensible heat, latent heat, and thermochemical heat storage. Search for new materials available as TES media still represents a challenge in energy research. Usage of by-products and wastes as TES materials, could promote implementation of sustainable and profitable thermal storage systems. These low-cost materials could also be considered ecofriendly, since they are not direct contributors to carbon dioxide emissions, and their use reduces material accumulation and, consequently, pollution due to non-metallic mining industry waste.', 'TITLE: Experimental evaluation of thermal energy storage (TES) with phase change materials (PCM) for ceiling tile applications | KEYWORDS: Building application; Energy storage; Phase change materials; Thermal energy performance | ABSTRACT: Thermal energy storage systems (TES) are an effective technology to improve the energy efficiency while reducing the energy consumption in buildings. The integration of phase change materials (PCMs) as latent thermal energy is a popular method to incorporate them into the building envelope, reducing the energy demand and helping maintain the thermal comfort. In this experimental evaluation, the application of S23 ceiling panels to enhance the building performance is investigated. To analyse the PCM panels, a test room was artificially heated securing the melting temperature for the material; the results show that the S23 panels were able to absorb and increase the room temperature by 5 °C. During the cooling period, the PCM ceiling tiles help maintain higher room temperatures, up to +1.5 °C. The S23 panel temperature was able to drop below its melting point after 6 hours of cooling, demonstrating its capacity to complete the thermal cycle. The panel thermal conductivity range was found between 0.19-0.24 W/(m K). It can be concluded that the addition of the S23 ceiling panels can be considered as an innovative solution for the application of passive TES in building envelopes, leading to energy savings by absorbing, storing and helping maintaining the ambient room temperature, therefore reducing the requirement for artificial heating and cooling.', 'TITLE: Characterization of wastes based on inorganic double salt hydrates as potential thermal energy storage materials | KEYWORDS: Double salts; Salt hydrates; Thermal energy storage; Waste materials | ABSTRACT: Thermal energy storage (TES) is seen today as a key technology to reduce the existing gap between energy demand and energy supply in many energy systems. There are, currently, three well known methods to store thermal energy and they are: sensible heat storage (SHS), latent heat storage (LHT) and thermochemical heat storage. Every method has its own thermophysical requirements for the mediums of storage, such as thermal stability, high enthalpy of phase change or reaction, high heat capacity and suitable temperature of the thermal phenomenon for a respective application, among others. In this regard, the composition of materials usually needs to be modified in order to improve their performance or to reach a determined requirement. As a consequence, the costs of potential TES materials to be applied in renewable energy systems are too high to compete with traditional systems using fossil fuels. On the other hand, several wastes and by-products from the non-metallic mining, such as salt hydrates and double salts, are available without any application but accumulating in the mining sites. This is the case for astrakanite (Na2SO4·MgSO4·4H2O) and lithium carnallite (LiCl·MgCl2·7H2O) with no current application, and potassium carnallite (KCl·MgCl2·6H2O) used as a supplementary raw material to obtain KCl. Since the costs of these materials are close to zero, they were characterized as TES materials taking into account the properties required for the three methods of storage. Results showed that astrakanite and potassium carnallite have potential to be applied as thermochemical material at low-medium temperature (<300 °C). Also, a dehydrated product obtained from astrakanite showed potential to be applied as phase change material (PCM) at high temperature, from 550 °C to 750 °C. Nevertheless, lithium carnallite did not show potential to be applied as TES material due to it low thermal stability, presenting partial decomposition below 200 °C.']"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of temperature over the innate and adaptive immune response of E. maclovinus challenged with Piscirickettsia salmonis following different treatments: C– (control injection with culture medium at 12 °C), C+ (bacterial injection at 12 °C), 18 °C c/A + B (injection with culture medium in acclimation at 18 °C), 18 °C c/A + B (bacterial injection in acclimation at 18 °C), 18 °C s/A + M (injection with culture medium without acclimation at 18 °C) and 18 °C s/A + B (bacterial injection without acclimation at 18 °C). Each injection had 100 μL of culture medium or with 100 μL at a concentration 1 × 108 of live bacteria, sampling six fish per group at 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 days post-injection (dpi).

Gene expression profiles were treatment-type and time dependent. Levels of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) increased in challenged groups with P. salmonis from day 8–20 post challenge, which suggest activation of B cells IgM + through P. salmonis epitope detection. Additionally, a rise in temperature from 12 °C (C+) to 18 °C (with/without acclimation) also resulted in antibody increment detected in serum with significant differences between “18 °C c/A + B” and “18 °C s/A + B” groups.

The latter corresponds to the income secure middle class. My approach makes two contributions. First, it extends recent research that defines the middle class using a vulnerability threshold by introducing a new subdivision of the vulnerable group that would be useful in practice for public policy objectives. Second, it uses two models to predict both the probability of entering poverty and household income as part of the estimation procedures. The former controls for initial conditions effects and attrition bias, and the latter addresses the retransformation problem. I apply my approach to Chile using longitudinal data from the P-CASEN 2006–2009. The resulting vulnerability cut-offs (using the upper-middle-income country poverty line) are $20.0 per person per day for the low vulnerability line and $9.9 pppd for the high vulnerability line (both in 2011 PPP). My vulnerability lines differ significantly from those estimated in previous research on vulnerability and the middle class in Latin America. I argue that previous research has underestimated the size of the population at risk of falling into poverty and overestimated the growth of the middle class. Misclassifying the vulnerable as middle class limits their access to anti-poverty policies.', ""TITLE: A Multidimensional Approach to Measuring Economic Insecurity: The Case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Economic insecurity; Global South; Multidimensional index; Survey of households finances; Well-being | ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a strategy to measure economic insecurity in countries in the Global South. It builds a 'Multidimensional Economic Insecurity Index' (MEII) that combines four indicators of economic vulnerability that cause stress and anxiety: unexpected economic shocks, unprotected employment or non-workers in the household, over-indebtedness and asset poverty. The index offers a measure that directly relates economic uncertainty to stress and anxiety due to the lack of protection and buffers to face an unexpected economic shock. The MEII is applied to Chile using Survey of Household Finances (SHF) cross-sectional data (2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017). The results show that (i) about half of the Chilean households experienced, on average, two or more economic vulnerabilities during the last decade with an intensity of 2.3 vulnerabilities, and (ii) economic insecurity affects households on the entire income distribution, even in the highest income deciles groups. By identifying the groups of households most affected by economic insecurity and its trend in recent years, applying the MEII in countries such as Chile provides relevant information to monitor, evaluate and improve social safety nets besides labour market regulations.""]"

Traveling waves or fronts between different states present complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We investigate the mechanisms that govern the front spread. Based on a liquid crystal light valve experiment with optical feedback, we show that the front propagation does not pursue a minimization of free energy. Depending on the free propagation length in the optical feedback loop, the front speed exhibits a supercritical transition. Theoretically, from first principles, we use a model that takes it into account, characterizing the speed transition from a plateau to a growing regime. The theoretical and experimental results show quite fair agreement.', 'TITLE: Traveling wave into an unstable state in dissipative oscillator chains | KEYWORDS: coupled oscillators; Front propagation; Nonlinear wave | ABSTRACT: Coupled oscillators can exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Here, we study the propagation of nonlinear waves into an unstable state in dissipative coupled oscillators. To this, we consider the dissipative Frenkel–Kontorova model, which accounts for a chain of coupled pendulums or Josephson junctions and coupling superconducting quantum interference devices. As a function of the dissipation parameter, the front that links the stable and unstable state is characterized by having a transition from monotonous to non-monotonous profile. In the conservative limit, these traveling nonlinear waves are unstable as a consequence of the energy released in the propagation. Traveling waves into unstable states are peculiar of dissipative coupling systems. When the coupling and the dissipation parameter are increased, the average front speed decreases. Based on an averaging method, we analytically determine the front speed. Numerical simulations show a quite fair agreement with the theoretical predictions. To show that our results are generic, we analyze a chain of coupled logistic equations. This model presents the predicted dynamics, opening the door to investigate a wider class of systems.', 'TITLE: Dissipative structures induced by photoisomerization in a dye-doped nematic liquid crystal layer | KEYWORDS: Front propagation; Liquid crystals; Phase transition | ABSTRACT: Order–disorder phase transitions driven by temperature or light in soft matter materials exhibit complex dissipative structures. Here, we investigate the spatio-temporal phenomena induced by light in a dye-doped nematic liquid crystal layer. Experimentally, for planar anchoring of the nematic layer and high enough input power, photoisomerization processes induce a nematic–isotropic phase transition mediated by interface propagation between the two phases. In the case of a twisted nematic layer and for intermediate input power, the light induces a spatially modulated phase, which exhibits stripe patterns. The pattern originates as an instability mediated by interface propagation between the modulated and the homogeneous nematic states. Theoretically, the phase transition, emergence of stripe patterns and front dynamics are described on the basis of a proposed model for the dopant concentration coupled with the nematic order parameter. Numerical simulations show quite a fair agreement with the experimental observations.

The aim of this study is to describe variations of endogenous jasmonate (JAs) contents and JA metabolism-related genes in order to associate these to the evolution of abscisic acid (ABA) content during development and ripening of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch. cv. Aromas) fruit. A quantitative analysis of phytohormones and gene expression was carried out using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, respectively. The expression of genes encoding for JA metabolism enzymes exhibited a significant decrease concomitant to reduction of JAs and an increment of ABA levels from flowering to ripening stages. Exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) triggered anthocyanin accumulation along with an increase in JA-Ile, JA, and MeJA levels, and a concomitant decrease in ABA. Together, these results provide insights into JAs homeostasis during strawberry fruit development, suggesting that MeJA-induced anthocyanin accumulation could be mediated by the activation of the JA signaling pathway. Furthermore, we propose an antagonistic relationship from the JA to the ABA pathway during non-climacteric strawberry fruit development and ripening.', 'TITLE: Jasmonate signalling pathway in strawberry: Genome-wide identification, molecular characterization and expression of JAZs and MYCs during fruit development and ripening | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Jasmonates (JAs) are signalling molecules involved in stress responses, development and secondary metabolism biosynthesis, although their roles in fleshy-fruit development and ripening processes are not well known.

However, this growth has raised concerns because of the negative effects this activity may have on the behavior and survival of focal species. Hence, detecting the effects of this activity requires sensitive analytical methods allowing the implementation of regulations to protect cetacean welfare. We compared the performance of different hypothesis tests from classical and Bayesian approaches to detect whale-watching effects on humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) behavior. From a cliff located 31 m above sea level in northern Peru, we measured breathing frequency, surface time, long dive duration, directness index (i.e., path linearity), and swimming speed of humpback whales before, during, and after encounters with whale-watching boats. During 167 hours of observation, we tracked 180 humpback whale groups; 43% of groups had calves and 57% did not. Inference by null-hypothesis testing indicated significant changes only in directness index after boat encounters in groups with a calf. Other methods of inference detected moderate behavior responses as increments in the number of adult breaths, swimming speed, and dive intervals for adults and calves. Whale-watching regulations must be implemented in Peru to regulate number of boats, distance to whales, approximate speed, and time observing humpback whales. Whale-watching of humpback whales with calves should be avoided. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.', 'TITLE: Evidence of Type A-Like Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) Predating on Marine Mammals Along the Atacama Desert Coast, Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Diet; Dusky dolphins; Fin whales; Killer whales; Orcinus orca; Sea lions; Southeast pacific | ABSTRACT: Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are marine apex predators distributed across the world’s oceans. In the last 40 years, researchers have increasingly differentiated killer whales into ecotypes based on genetics, morphology, behaviour, acoustic repertoire, habitat, and trophic ecology. While killer whale ecotypes in the Northern Hemisphere are well studied, the recognition of distinct killer whale forms in the Southern Hemisphere is mainly limited to Antarctic waters. Although present in less studied regions, such as along the Atacama Desert coast in the Southeast Pacific Ocean, limited information is available regarding their biology or trophic ecology. Herein, multiple lines of evidence are presented for killer whale predation on marine mammals in northern Chile. Using information from systematic boat-based surveys, whale-watching tour surveys, and reports from fishermen/citizen scientists, 19 killer whale sightings are reported along the coast of northern Chile (from the Arica and Parinacota region in the north to the Atacama region in the south). Killer whales were photo-identified as corresponding to the Southern Hemisphere Type A-like ecotype according to their dorsal fin shape and white eye patch. One killer whale pod, which included two males, one female, one juvenile, and one calf, was resighted six times from 2016 to 2021 in northern Chile and was observed hunting South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens), dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), and long-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus cf. capensis). Killer whales were observed taking advantage of large aggregations of sea lions associated with the off-shore purse-seine fishery. Adult killer whales used the hulls of fishing vessels to prevent sea lions from escaping. Photo-identification analysis of a fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) catalogue from Mejillones Peninsula showed that 2.6% of all identified whales had apparent rake marks from killer whale teeth on their dorsal fins. These data show that Type A-like killer whales in northern Chile prey on several species of marine mammals', 'TITLE: Temporal patterns in the acoustic presence of baleen whale species in a presumed breeding area off Namibia | KEYWORDS: Antarctic blue whales; Antarctic minke whales; Baleen whale breeding grounds; Fin whales; Humpback whales; Migratory behavior; Passive acoustic monitoring; South Atlantic Ocean | ABSTRACT: The eastern Atlantic Ocean is considered to provide important breeding and wintering habitats for several migratory cetacean species. The spatio-temporal distributions and migratory behaviors of cetaceans off southern Africa are nevertheless still poorly understood. This study investigated the temporal patterns of acoustic occurrence of baleen whales in a presumed baleen whale breeding area off Namibia using passive acoustic recordings collected between November 2011 and May 2013. Our results show seasonal acoustic presence of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, fin whales Balaenoptera physalus and Antarctic minke whales B. bonaerensis from November to January and from June to August. Their acoustic absence from February to May possibly indicates that most animals migrated to other areas (presumably in higher latitudes) in austral summer to feed. By contrast, Antarctic blue whales B. musculus intermedia were acoustically present throughout the recording period, indicating that part of the population remains at lower latitudes year-round. Our findings support the presumed ecological importance of the oceanic area off Namibia, providing (part of) a suitable cetacean wintering and, possibly, breeding range or migratory corridor. Furthermore, the occurrence of Antarctic blue and minke whales off Namibia, concurrent with their reported acoustic presence in high-latitude feeding areas, adds to growing evidence that baleen whale migration is not obligate but much more dynamic than has long been assumed.']"

The bulge globular clusters (GCs) are key tracers of the bulge, a central and ancient component of our Galaxy. It is essential to understand their formation and evolution to study that of the bulge, as well as their relationship with the other Galactic GC systems (halo and disk GCs). High-resolution spectroscopy is a powerful tool for such studies, allowing us to obtain a detailed chemical characterization and kinematics of the clusters and to compare their chemical patterns with those of their halo and disk counterparts. Aims. Our main goals are to obtain detailed abundances for a sample of seven red giant members of NGC 6528 in order to characterize their chemical composition and study the relationship of this GC with the bulge, and with other bulge, halo, and disk GCs. Moreover, we analyze this cluster's behavior associated with the multiple-populations phenomenon. Methods. We obtained the stellar parameters and chemical abundances of light elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu), α-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) and heavy elements (Zr, Ba, Eu) in seven red giant members of NGC 6528 using high-resolution spectroscopy from FLAMES-UVES. Results. In six stars of our sample we obtained a mean iron content of [Fe/H] =-0.14 ± 0.03 dex, in good agreement with other studies. We found no significant internal iron spread. We detected one candidate variable star, which was excluded from the mean in iron content, and derived a metallicity in this star of [Fe/H] =-0.55 ± 0.04 dex. Moreover, we found no extended O-Na anticorrelation but instead only an intrinsic Na spread. In addition, NGC 6528 does not exhibit a Mg-Al anticorrelation, and no significant spread in either Mg or Al. The α and iron-peak elements show good agreement with the bulge field star trend. The heavy elements are slightly dominated by the r-process. The chemical analysis suggests an origin and evolution similar to that of typical old Galactic bulge field stars. Finally, we find remarkable agreement in the chemical patterns of NGC 6528 and another bulge GC, NGC 6553, suggesting a similar origin and evolution."", 'TITLE: Chemical analysis of the bulge globular cluster NGC 6553 | KEYWORDS: Bulge; Galaxy: globular clusters: individual: NGC 6553; Stars: abundances | ABSTRACT: Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Galaxy, thus their researchers are key to understanding the processes of evolution and formation that the galaxy has experienced in early stages.

A mathematical formulation is proposed to incorporate mining width constraints into the production scheduling process, aiming to maximize the NPV of the schedule while ensuring enough room for the operation of mining equipment. To tackle the computational challenges posed by large-scale instances of the problem, we propose a method based on variable fixing and horizontal precedence generation. In this study, we apply the developed model to real-world scenarios from Radomiro Tomic short-term mine planning problems such as optimizing the timing of major truck maintenance and the impact of external factors, like the delay in the production of the Chuquicamata underground project. Remarkable improvements are observed with the mining width-constrained model. Specifically, the mining width satisfiability is enhanced from 2 to 60% compared to the traditional open pit mine production scheduling model, underscoring the significance of incorporating these constraints.

However, the effect of environmental conditions on orchid mycorrhizal associations remains poorly understood. The present study examined how differences in soil nutrient availability are related to the diversity and composition of mycorrhizal fungi associated with two terrestrial orchid species from central Chile. Methods For 12 populations of Bipinnula fimbriata and B. plumosa, OTU (operational taxonomic unit) richness, phylogenetic diversity and community composition of mycorrhizal fungi in root samples were estimated using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Then, these mycorrhizal diversity variables were related to soil nutrients and host species using generalized linear models and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Key Results Variation in OTU composition of mycorrhizal fungi among sites was explained mainly by orchid host species. Fungi in Tulasnellaceae and Ceratobasidiaceae were isolated from both orchid species, but the former were more frequent in B. fimbriata and the latter in B. plumosa. Soil nutrients and orchid host species had significant effects on OTU richness and phylogenetic diversity. Mycorrhizal diversity decreased in habitats with higher N in both species and increased with P availability only in B. fimbriata. Conclusions The results suggest that soil nutrient availability modulates orchid mycorrhizal associations and provide support for the hypothesis that specialization is favoured by higher soil nutrient availability. Inter-specific differences in mycorrhizal composition can arise due to a geographical pattern of distribution of orchid mycorrhizal fungi, host preferences for fungal partners or differential performance of mycorrhizal fungi under different nutrient availabilities. Further experiments are needed to evaluate these hypotheses.', 'TITLE: Vineyard maturity increases arbuscular mycorrhizal and decreases plant pathogen fungal relative abundance in bulk soil across a 1,000 km Chilean gradient | KEYWORDS: arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; biotic stress; Chilean vineyards; grapevines; terroir | ABSTRACT: Societal Impact Statement: Wine production has a significant impact on the global economy. Despite this, the microbial composition of the terroir has not been studied sufficiently, particularly in the southern hemisphere. Here, we investigated how bulk soil fungal communities are affected by several abiotic and biotic factors across 1,000 km of Chilean vineyards. We found that geographical distance was the main driver of vineyard soil fungal communities. Irrespective of variety, older vineyards host a higher relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and a lower relative abundance of plant pathogenic fungi. This result could lead to significant recommendations on when to apply AMF-based inoculants. Summary: The microbial dimension of the terroir has been increasingly recognized as an essential factor determining vineyard productivity and quality. Despite this, few studies have analyzed the factors affecting soil fungal communities of vineyards in the southern hemisphere. Across a 1,000 km gradient encompassing 34 Chilean vineyards, we investigated the effects of grapevine variety, geographical distance, maturity, and soil chemical properties on the diversity and composition of soil fungi. We implemented standard soil chemical analyses and ITS-based DNA metabarcoding of bulk soil. We found that the total soil fungal composition was significantly affected by geographical distance but not by grapevine variety and maturity. Soil chemical dissimilarity also significantly affected soil fungal composition. When analyzing specific fungal guilds, we found a contrasting successional pattern: arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal relative abundance was significantly higher at medium and old-maturity vineyards compared with young vineyards, on which plant pathogenic fungi had a markedly lower abundance. Our results present several caveats: the molecular marker was not the most commonly used for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, bulk soil was sampled (instead of roots), and all abundances were relative. Still, this study constitutes one of the most extensive studies on soil fungi – both for vineyards and Chile – and might have practical implications, as knowing the drivers of fungal and mycorrhizal biodiversity can inform agricultural management decisions.', ""TITLE: Soil P reduces mycorrhizal colonization while favors fungal pathogens: Observational and experimental evidence in Bipinnula (Orchidaceae) | KEYWORDS: Bipinnula; Fungal guilds; Fungal root community; Orchid fertilization; Orchid mycorrhiza; Soil nutrients | ABSTRACT: Little is known about the soil factors influencing root-associated fungal communities in Orchidaceae. Limited evidence suggests that soil nutrients may modulate the association with orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF), but their influence on non-mycorrhizal fungi remains unexplored. To study how nutrient availability affects mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi associated with the orchid Bipinnula fimbriata, we conducted a metagenomic investigation within a large population with variable soil conditions. Additionally, we tested the effect of phosphorus (P) addition on fungal communities and mycorrhizal colonization. Soil P negatively correlated with the abundance of OMF, but not with the abundance of non-mycorrhizal fungi. After fertilization, increments in soil P negatively affected mycorrhizal colonization; however, they had no effect on OMF richness or composition. The abundance and richness of pathotrophs were negatively related to mycorrhizal colonization and then, after fertilization, the decrease in mycorrhizal colonization correlated with an increase in pathogen richness. Our results suggest that OMF are affected by soil conditions differently from non-mycorrhizal fungi. Bipinnula fimbriata responds to fertilization by altering mycorrhizal colonization rather than by switching OMF partners in the short term, and the influence of nutrients on OMF is coupled with indirect effects on the whole fungal community and potentially on plant's health.""]"

It is fed by springs located on its eastern and northern boundaries.These springs discharge groundwater from a volcanic aquifer. Arid conditions dominate in the area, with average precipitation less than 200 mm/year. The tritium content in some groundwater samples shows the contribution of modern recharge to the total groundwater flow. Recharge occurs by infiltration of snowmelt in the austral winter months and to a lesser extent by short but intense precipitation events during the summer. The vertical gradients of rainfall isotopic content (δ18O, δ2H) and precipitation points to the recharge zone of the springs being located at the northern area of the lake, above 4,900 m a.s.l. along the slopes of the Tuyajto volcano, whereas recharge to the springs discharging on the eastern area of the lake originates in the adjacent basins of Pampa Colorada and Pampa LasTecas at altitudes between 4,400 and 4,700 m a.s.l. The water of these springs may contain measurable tritium. The chemical composition of groundwater is the result of meteoric water evaporation processes, high temperature water-rock interaction and dissolution of buried old salt flat deposits. The groundwater flow is shallow, due to the presence of a regional low permeability ignimbrite formation that precludes the formation of deep convective groundwater flow cells due to the high density of brines. At a local scale, theTuyajto lake behaves as a flow-through system with respect to the regional groundwater flow. The persistence of the springs is essential for the existence of the brine sheet and maintaining the ecological conditions for the waterfowl.', 'TITLE: Origin of old saline groundwater in the deep coastal formations of the Atacama Desert region: Consideration of lithium, boron, strontium and uranium isotopes contents | KEYWORDS: Atacama Desert; Boron isotopes; Fractured rock; Lithium isotopes; Old saline groundwater; Strontium isotopes | ABSTRACT: This paper presents a multi-isotopic study to investigate the origin of saline groundwater in the Cordillera de la Costa, in the arid Atacama Desert region in northern Chile. Understanding the origin of deep saline groundwater can be challenging using only hydrogeochemical and common isotope methods. New 87Sr/86Sr, δ11B, δ7Li, and 234U/238U values of dissolved salts have been added to previously known chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater, inorganic dissolved carbon, and sulfate. In this extremely arid area, the chemical and isotopic compositions of coastal springs primarily reflect the concentration of salts from atmospheric wet and dry deposition, which accumulate in the topsoil and dissolve during the occasional heavy rainfall events. These events recharge the aquifer with sodium-chloride type, high salinity water, with rock weathering contributing minimally to the chemical composition of groundwater. However, high salinity water of the calcium chloride and sodium-calcium chloride types in the deep fractured aquifer have a significantly different chemical and isotopic composition. In this investigation, it has been concluded that the salinity of these last waters is due to remnants of ancient marine water, mineral alteration and interaction with predominantly andesitic volcanic rocks in the Cordillera de la Costa. The deep saline groundwater has δ11B values between 17.3‰ and 20.7‰, and 87Sr/86Sr values below 0.706, suggesting mixing with recharge groundwater. The δ7Li composition of the deep groundwater varies between 23.5‰ and 31.5‰, pointing to a contribution of salts of marine origin and mineral alteration. However, the low Li concentrations relative to B in recharge water and in deep groundwater shows a preferential Li removal from pore water.

Understanding the origin of deep saline groundwater can be challenging using only hydrogeochemical and common isotope methods. New 87Sr/86Sr, δ11B, δ7Li, and 234U/238U values of dissolved salts have been added to previously known chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater, inorganic dissolved carbon, and sulfate. In this extremely arid area, the chemical and isotopic compositions of coastal springs primarily reflect the concentration of salts from atmospheric wet and dry deposition, which accumulate in the topsoil and dissolve during the occasional heavy rainfall events. These events recharge the aquifer with sodium-chloride type, high salinity water, with rock weathering contributing minimally to the chemical composition of groundwater. However, high salinity water of the calcium chloride and sodium-calcium chloride types in the deep fractured aquifer have a significantly different chemical and isotopic composition. In this investigation, it has been concluded that the salinity of these last waters is due to remnants of ancient marine water, mineral alteration and interaction with predominantly andesitic volcanic rocks in the Cordillera de la Costa. The deep saline groundwater has δ11B values between 17.3‰ and 20.7‰, and 87Sr/86Sr values below 0.706, suggesting mixing with recharge groundwater. The δ7Li composition of the deep groundwater varies between 23.5‰ and 31.5‰, pointing to a contribution of salts of marine origin and mineral alteration. However, the low Li concentrations relative to B in recharge water and in deep groundwater shows a preferential Li removal from pore water. Uranium and uranium isotopes data are limited to shallow groundwater due to the very low U concentrations in deep groundwater following reduction of U, and point to enhanced water–rock interaction in a rock-dominated environment. The dissolution of old buried saline deposits at shallow depth as a source of salinity is ruled out.']"

The reactivity of Trp towards ROO should be strongly affected by its inclusion in peptides and proteins. To examine the latter, we investigated (by fluorescence) the kinetic of the consumption of free, peptide- and protein-Trp residues towards AAPH (2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride)-derived free radicals. Interestingly, the initial consumption rates (Ri) were only slightly influenced by the inclusion of Trp in small peptides and proteins (human serum albumin and human superoxide dismutase). Depending on the Trp concentration, the Riversus Trp concentration ([Trp]) plots showed three regions. At low Trp concentrations (1-10 μM), a linear dependence was observed between Ri and [Trp]; at intermediate Trp concentrations (10-50 μM), the values of Ri were nearly constant; and at high Trp concentrations (50 μM to 1 mM), a slower increase of Ri than expected for chain reactions. Similar behavior was detected for all three systems (free Trp, and Trp in peptides and proteins). For the first time we are showing that alkoxyl radicals, formed from self-reaction of ROO, are responsible of the Trp oxidation at low concentrations, while at high Trp concentrations, a mixture of peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals are involved in the oxidation of Trp residues.', 'TITLE: Aggregation of α- and β- caseins induced by peroxyl radicals involves secondary reactions of carbonyl compounds as well as di-tyrosine and di-tryptophan formation | KEYWORDS: Caseins; Di-tryptophan; Di-tyrosine; Peroxyl radicals; Protein carbonyls; Protein crosslinking; Protein fragmentation; Tryptophan; Tyrosine | ABSTRACT: The present work examined the role of Tyr and Trp in oxidative modifications of caseins, the most abundant milk proteins, induced by peroxyl radicals (ROO • ).

Oxidative modifications were examined using electrophoresis, western blotting, fluorescence, and chromatographic methodologies with diode array, fluorescence and mass detection. Exposure of caseins to AAPH at 37 °C gave fragmentation, cross-linking and protein aggregation. Amino acid analysis showed consumption of Trp, Tyr, Met, His and Lys residues.

Objectives: To describe and analyse the therapeutic relationship integrating the views of children, parents and therapists. Methods: This study employs a qualitative methodology, assuming a discovery-oriented approach which draws from grounded theory. Twelve psychotherapy triads participated, composed of children aged 6–10, their parents and psychotherapists. Semi-structured follow-up interviews were conducted (N=36), including a drawing in the case of the children. Results: A positive therapeutic relationship with children and parents was viewed as a gradually constructed process, based on a positive emotional encounter between participants. It was facilitated primarily by the therapist’s commitment and playful stance, the child and therapist mutual involvement, and the parent’s collaboration. These aspects entailed a trustful, validating and caring relationship, that shaped children and parents’ motivations towards therapy and facilitated change. Conclusions: From a multiple-perspective approach, therapy was conceived as a relational experience. The development of positive relationships required different and evolving dispositions from therapy main actors.

The children, parents, and therapists (N=15) who formed part of five therapeutic treatments were studied using a qualitative, longitudinal design. Thirty semi-structured interviews were done; half at the beginning and half after four months of psychotherapy. Children's drawings were incorporated, and data were analysed through grounded theory methods and qualitative analysis guidelines for drawings. Participants identified several aspects of the therapeutic relationship as change facilitators. From the first encounters, the therapists' close and adaptable attitude promoted an improved motivation for psychotherapy and enhanced engagement among children and parents. Later in the process, a positive, child-centred and affective therapeutic relationship fostered the child's trust with the therapist as well as a positive relational experience, promoting associated changes in children and the development of socio-affective tools. Parents and therapists saw their own relationship as a change facilitator, as well as a broader understanding in parents of their children and an improved relationship with them. Parent's and child's changes helped each other. Specific and common aspects between participants' perspectives provided a richer understanding of the studied phenomena. This study supports the view that a positive therapeutic relationship facilitates early changes in the motivation of children and parents, and provides them with a healing, relational experience as it develops. A positive parent-therapist relationship is also key for changes to further progress."", 'TITLE: The therapeutic relationship as a change mechanism in child psychotherapy: a qualitative study of children, parents’, and therapists’ views in different moments of the process La relación terapéutica como un mecanismo de cambio en la psicoterapia infantil: un estudio cualitativo de las perspectivas de niño/as, padres, y terapeutas en diferentes momentos del proceso | KEYWORDS: change mechanism; child psychotherapy; qualitative studies; therapeutic alliance; therapeutic relationship | ABSTRACT: The therapeutic relationship is organized triadically between children, therapists and parents, yet little research focuses on its evolution as a change mechanism integrating these perspectives. Develop a comprehensive model of the therapeutic relationship as a change mechanism in different phases of psychotherapy, from the perspective of children, parents and therapists. A grounded theory analysis integrated findings from a retrospective and a qualitative longitudinal study of the therapeutic relationship with children and parents as change factors based on semi-structured interviews and children’s drawings. Initially, therapists’ close, flexible attitude improved children’s and parents’ motivation for psychotherapy. Later, a child-centred, playful relationship fostered children’s affection and trust in the therapists, promoting emotional and socio-affective changes. Lastly, as a greater bond developed, children internalized the therapist as a significant figure, and deeper changes emerged. Parents’ changes were eased by further trust and collaboration in the relationship with the therapist, and changes in the child-parent relationship emerged.

Thus, the estimation of CTmax and its evolutionary potential is crucial to determine their vulnerability to global warming. However, CTmax estimations depend on the thermal stress intensity, and it is not completely clear whether its evolutionary capacity can be affected. Here, we performed an artificial selection experiment to increase heat tolerance using fast- and slow-ramping selection protocols in Drosophila subobscura. We found that heat tolerance evolved in both selection protocols, exhibiting similar evolutionary change rates and realized heritabilities. Additionally, we estimated the thermal performance curves (TPC) to evaluate correlated responses to selection on heat tolerance. We detected that thermal optimum increased in fast-ramping selection lines, but with a cost at the thermal performance breadth. Conversely, we did not detect changes in the TPC for the slow-ramping selection lines, indicating that thermal stress intensity has important effects on the evolution of thermal physiology of ectotherms. These findings, together with previous studies in D. subobscura reporting interpopulation variability and significant heritabilities for heat tolerance, suggest that evolutionary change can contribute to insect persistence in thermally changing environments and adaptation to global warming conditions.', ""TITLE: Variation in thermal tolerance response associated with geographic location during early development of the neogastropod Ocenebra erinaceus (Linnaeus, 1758) | KEYWORDS: Intracapsular development; Intraspecific differences; Neogastropoda; Ocenebra erinaceus; Thermal tolerance | ABSTRACT: Environmental temperature plays an important role in shaping the distribution and abundance of marine ectothermic organisms. As a general rule, larvae and juveniles are more sensitive to thermal stress than adults and, as a consequence, represent key life stages that determine in part the geographic range of a species. Identifying critical thermal limits during ontogeny allows for the prediction of the potential impacts of climate warming on the distribution of marine ectotherms. However, thermal tolerance - and therefore the potential to meet the challenge of warming- is known to vary at population scale for many species. In order to fully appreciate a species' future under climate warming, multiple populations studies from different thermal environments are necessary. In this study, we compared the thermal tolerance response during the intracapsular development of the marine gastropod Ocenebra erinaceus between two geographically separated populations: one from the middle (Solent, UK) and another from the south of the species' geographic range (Arcachon, France). The results show that the thermal tolerance response was influenced by geographic origin. Embryos from the relatively warm-water southern population (France) show a warm-eurythermal tolerance window with optimal temperatures between 12 and 18 °C. On the contrary, embryos from the cold-water northern population (UK) exhibit a narrow, warm-stenothermal, thermal tolerance window with optimal temperatures between 14 and 16 °C. In both populations, temperatures outside of the thermal range cause lethal and sub-lethal effects. Importantly, previously observed dispersal polymorphism was not observed at hatching time in either population in our study. Our study demonstrates that during early developmental stages, embryos are adapted to local thermal conditions and that they live very close to their upper thermal limits. Temperatures outside this range cause detrimental and contrasting effects on embryonic development of O. erinaceus, implying that the effects of future warming will depend on the population response to local environmental history. Our results suggest that global warming could shift the geographical distribution range of O. erinaceus poleward."", 'TITLE: Embryonic encapsulated development of the gastropod Acanthina monodon is impacted by future environmental changes of temperature and pCO2 | KEYWORDS: Acanthina monodon; Embryos; Encapsulated development; Hatching; Ocean acidification; Oxygen consumption; Temperature | ABSTRACT: Egg capsules of the gastropod Acanthina monodon were maintained during the entire period of encapsulated development at three temperatures (10, 15, 20 °C) and two pCO2 levels (400, 1200 μatm). Embryos per capsule, size at hatching, time to hatching, embryonic metabolic rates, and the resistance of juveniles to shell breakage were quantified. No embryos maintained at 20 °C developed to hatching. The combination of temperature and pCO2 levels had synergistic effects on hatching time and developmental success, antagonistic effects on number of hatchlings per capsule, resistance to juvenile shell cracking and metabolism, and additive effect on hatching size. Juveniles hatched significantly sooner at 15 °C, independent of the pCO2 level that they had been exposed to, while individuals hatched at significantly smaller sizes if they had been held under 15 °C/1200 μatm rather than at 10 °C/low pCO2. Embryos held at the higher pCO2 had a significantly greater percentage of abnormalities. For capsules maintained at low pCO2 and 15 °C, emerging juveniles had less resistance to shell breakage. Embryonic metabolism was significantly higher at 15 °C than at 10 °C, independent of pCO2 level. The lower metabolism occurred in embryos maintained at the higher pCO2 level. Thus, in this study, temperature was the factor that had the greatest effect on the encapsulated development of A. monodon, increasing the metabolism of the embryos and consequently accelerating development, which was expressed in a shorter intracapsular development time, but with smaller individuals at hatching and a lower resistance of their shells to breakage. On the other hand, the high pCO2 level suppressed metabolism, prolonged intracapsular development, and promoted more incomplete development of the embryos. However, the combination of the two factors can mitigate–to some extent–the adverse effects of both incomplete development and lower resistance to shell breakage.']"

In this article, we aim to highlight the relevance of community environmental psychology for analyzing both the subjective aspects of people-place relationships and the community relations of the towns hit by disasters. To do this, we present a conceptual framework community psychology and environmental psychology categories which are relevant for studying what we call socio-spatial links in socio-natural disaster situations. This perspective is illustrated by presenting the results of a study carried out with a mixed methodology, which describes how these links emerge in people who have lived in communities affected by earthquakes, a tsunami, and a volcanic eruption in 4 Chilean towns. Responses to the scales of place attachment, place identity, residential satisfaction, sense of community, and civic participation were analyzed in a non-probability (convenience) sample (n = 628), along with reports of 17 focus groups (n = 117) on the constructed meanings of public space. It is concluded that the articulation of environmental and community psychology broadens our understanding of elements of power and dispute in the territory, while also making psychosocial flaws visible in post-disaster reconstruction solutions.', 'TITLE: Divergent disaster events? The politics of post-disaster memory on the urban margin | KEYWORDS: Disaster culture; Disaster interpretations; Disaster memory; DRR; Landscape as arena; Landscape of memory; Urban disaster | ABSTRACT: Rather than one-time events, disasters are processual phenomena driven by multiple drivers of disaster risk and that leave a myriad of traces on affected areas. Remembering such traces can help local communities to deal with disaster impacts. Memorialisation is not neutral, however, as memory by definition selects certain symbols and excludes others, rendering this a contentious process. By focusing on the politics of disaster memory, I show how these processes reveal divergent interpretations of ‘ongoing’ disasters. Based on ethnographic methods, I analyse post-disaster memorialisation in a marginal area of the foothills of Santiago, Chile, where on 3 May 1993, a rain-induced landslide destroyed 300 houses and left almost 4000 victims including 26 people killed. Since then, a particular landscape of memory consisting of symbols, memorials and practices has emerged. Drawing on a notion of landscape as an ‘arena’, I describe how this memorialisation perpetuates the 1993 disaster and produces contested interpretations of it. Besides contrasting the views of state and non-state actors, as well as long-time residents and newcomers, I expand on a more explicit confrontation between two local groups. While both parties agree that the disaster is not a past ‘event’ but a processual phenomenon, they differ in the content of their interpretations: for some, memory is anchored in the past and their responsibility is to be united in commemoration; for others, remembrance practices can support calls for justice regarding ongoing disaster vulnerability. As such, disaster memory has different political implications: symbols and practices can prescribe ways of either maintaining the status quo or addressing the root causes of disasters. I show that post-disaster landscapes of memory are not only multiple and diverse, but also open and remade through practices and discourses that can directly contest disaster risk creation.', 'TITLE: Natural Disasters and Birth Rate: Evidence from the 2010 Chilean Earthquake | KEYWORDS: Birth rates; demography; earthquake; natural disaster; social dynamics | ABSTRACT: A major natural disaster can generate changes in the affected population’s behavior. As Chile is considered one of the countries with the highest seismic activity and has experienced several of the most intense earthquakes on record in the world, this work seeks to identify behavioral changes in the birth rate within an affected population related to a natural disaster in Chile. Based on evidence from the 2010 Chilean earthquake, an empirical study was carried out drawing on birth rate data and social data associated with earthquakes in Chile between 2004 and 2015. Two models were estimated. The first model is a difference-in-differences model for determining the effect of the disaster on the birth rate in the affected area in the post-disaster period. The second model is a triple-difference model that includes the trend of the data over time. The results indicate a positive relationship between the variation in the birth rate and the occurrence of the natural disaster. Studying the relationship between disaster events and fertility contributes to understanding the phenomena of social dynamics. This knowledge could improve public policy decision making for better planning in the face of a natural disaster.']"

Currently, the main challenge is the treatment of rubber materials such as waste tyres, where the mixture of rubber polymers with different additives and the cross-linked structure obtained due to the vulcanisation process positions them as highly persistent materials. This study characterises the degradation of different rubber-containing substrates in in vivo and in vitro processes using the bacterium Rhodococcus rhodochrous and the oxygenase latex clearing protein (Lcp) from the same strain. For the first time, the degradation of polyisoprene particles in liquid cultures of R. rhodochrous was analysed, obtaining up to 19.32% mass loss of the polymer when using it as the only carbon source. Scanning electron microscopy analysis demonstrated surface alteration of pure polyisoprene and vulcanised rubber particles after 2 weeks of incubation. The enzyme LcpRR was produced in bioreactors under rhamnose induction and its activity characterised in oxygen consumption assays at different enzyme concentrations. A maximum consumption of 28.38 µmolO2/min was obtained by adding 100 µg/mL LcpRR to a 2% (v/v) latex emulsion as substrate. The bioconversion of natural rubber into reaction degradation products or oligoisoprenoids was calculated to be 32.54%. Furthermore, the mass distribution of the oligoisoprenoids was analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and 17 degradation products, ranging from C20 to C100 oligoisoprenoids, were identified. The multi-enzymatic degradation capacity of R. rhodochrous positions it as a model microorganism in complex degradation processes such as in the case of tyre waste.', 'TITLE: Impact of additives of commercial rubber compounds on the microbial and enzymatic degradation of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) | KEYWORDS: Gordonia polyisoprenivorans VH2; Latex clearing protein; Microbial rubber degradation; Rubber additives | ABSTRACT: Much fundamental research has already been performed to understand the mechanism of microbial rubber degradation. Due to the increasing amount of rubber waste, biotechnical methods to degrade that particular waste are strongly needed. The present study evaluates whether a microbial or an enzymatic process is more suitable for efficient biodegradation, due to less sensitivity towards rubber additives. Therefore we investigated the impact of 15 different frequently used rubber additives on cells of the potent rubber degrader Gordonia polyisoprenivorans VH2 and the enzyme Lcp1 VH2 . For this, cells were grown on poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) in presence of these rubber additives. Furthermore, the effect of those additives on the enzymatic cleavage of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) by Lcp1 VH2 was determined by in vitro studies. It was observed that additives, used to accelerate the vulcanization process, like N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide and zinc-bis(N,N-dibenzyl-dithiocarbamate), are diminishing the growth of the microorganism depending on their concentration—higher toxicity with increasing concentration. In contrast, sulfur prevents cell growth, but does not affect Lcp1 VH2 . Stearic acid and paraffin wax were found to be consumed by G. polyisoprenivorans VH2. Plasticizers mainly prevent growth, but do not interfere with the enzyme activity. This study identified antioxidants as the most interfering group of additives for microbial and enzymatic rubber degradation. It was found that the in vitro degradation by Lcp1 VH2 is much more resistant and less sensitive towards the investigated rubber additives, when compared to the in vivo approach. Therefore, an enzymatic process might be a promising method to enhance rubber degradation.', 'TITLE: Bacterial and enzymatic degradation of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) rubber: Novel biotechnological applications | KEYWORDS: Applied biocatalysis; Multi-step biodegradation; Poly(cis-1,4-isoprene); Polymer biotrasformation; Rubber degradation; Rubber degrading bacteria; Rubber oxygenases | ABSTRACT: Poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) rubber is a highly demanded elastomeric material mainly used for the manufacturing of tires. The end-cycle of rubber-made products is creating serious environmental concern and, therefore, different recycling processes have been proposed. However, the current physical-chemical processes include the use of hazardous chemical solvents, large amounts of energy, and possibly generations of unhealthy micro-plastics. Under this scenario, eco-friendly alternatives are needed and biotechnological rubber treatments are demonstrating huge potential. The cleavage mechanisms and the biochemical pathways for the uptake of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) rubber have been extensively reported. Likewise, novel bacterial strains able to degrade the polymer have been studied and the involved structural and functional enzymes have been analyzed. Considering the fundamentals, biotechnological approaches have been proposed considering process optimization, cost-effective methods and larger-scale experiments in the search for practical and realistic applications. In this work, the latest research in the rubber biodegradation field is shown and discussed, aiming to analyze the combination of detoxification, devulcanization and polymer-cleavage mechanisms to achieve better degradation yields. The modified superficial structure of rubber materials after biological treatments might be an interesting way to reuse old rubber for re-vulcanization or to find new materials.']"

The method has a quantitative approach with cross-sectional data in a sample composed of 115 university students of a career in the area of Engineering. Data processing was performed using the Partial Least Squares method. The results show that learning experiences have a positive effect on the variables under study and specifically on academic performance.

Ang (1–7), through its receptor Mas, has an opposite action to angiotensin II (Ang II), the typical peptide of the classical RAS axis. Ang II produces skeletal muscle atrophy, a pathological condition characterised by the loss of strength and muscle mass. A feature of muscle atrophy is the decrease of the myofibrillar proteins produced by the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP), evidenced by the increase in the expression of two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases: atrogin-1 and MuRF-1. In addition, it has been described that Ang II also induces myonuclear apoptosis during muscle atrophy.We assessed the effects of Ang (1–7) and Mas participation on myonuclear apoptosis during skeletal muscle atrophy induced by Ang II. Our results show that Ang (1–7), through Mas, prevents the effects induced by Ang II in the diaphragm muscles and decreases several events associated with apoptosis in the diaphragm (increased apoptotic nuclei, increased expression of caspase-8 and caspase-9, increased caspase-3 activity and increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio). Concomitantly, Ang (1–7) also attenuates the decrease in fibre diameter and muscle strength, and prevents the increase in atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 during the muscle wasting induced by Ang II. Interestingly, these effects of Ang (1–7) are dependent on the Mas receptor. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that Ang (1–7) prevents myonuclear apoptosis during the recovery of skeletal muscle atrophy induced by Ang II.', 'TITLE: Angiotensin-(1-7) decreases skeletal muscle atrophy induced by angiotensin II through a Mas receptor-dependent mechanism | KEYWORDS: Angiotensin-(1-7); Atrophy; Mas; Muscle wasting; Skeletal muscle | ABSTRACT: Skeletal muscle atrophy is a pathological condition characterized by the loss of strength and muscle mass, an increase in myosin heavy chain (MHC) degradation and increase in the expression of two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases: atrogin-1 and MuRF-1. Angiotensin II (AngII) induces muscle atrophy. Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], through its receptor Mas, produces the opposite effects than AngII. We assessed the effects of Ang-(1-7) on the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by AngII. Our results show that Ang-(1-7), through Mas, prevents the effects induced by AngII in muscle gastrocnemius: the decrease in the fibre diameter, muscle strength and MHC levels and the increase in atrogin-1 and MuRF-1. Ang-(1-7) also induces AKT phosphorylation. In addition, our analysis in vitro using C2C12 myotubes shows that Ang-(1-7), through a mechanism dependent on Mas, prevents the decrease in the levels of MHC and the increase in the expression of the atrogin-1 and MuRF-1, both induced by AngII. Ang-(1-7) induces AKT phosphorylation in myotubes; additionally, we demonstrated that the inhibition of AKT with MK-2206 decreases the anti-atrophic effects of Ang-(1-7). Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that Ang-(1-7) counteracts the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by AngII through a mechanism dependent on the Mas receptor, which involves AKT activity. Our study indicates that Ang-(1-7) is novel molecule with a potential therapeutical use to improve muscle wasting associated, at least, with pathologies that present high levels of AngII.', 'TITLE: Angiotensin-(1-7) Prevents Skeletal Muscle Atrophy Induced by Transforming Growth Factor Type Beta (TGF-β) via Mas Receptor Activation | KEYWORDS: Mas receptor; MHC; MuRF-1; Muscle wasting; ng-(1-7); TGF-β | ABSTRACT: Background: Transforming growth factor type beta 1 (TGF-β1) produces skeletal muscle atrophy. Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), through the Mas receptor, prevents the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by sepsis, immobilization, or angiotensin II (Ang-II). However, the effect of Ang-(1-7) on muscle wasting induced by TGF-β1 is unknown. Aim: To evaluate whether Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis could prevent the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by TGF-β1. Methods: This study assessed the atrophic effect of TGF-β1 in C 2 C 12 myotubes and mice in absence or presence of Ang-(1-7), and the receptor participation using A779, an antagonist of the Mas receptor. The levels of myosin heavy chain (MHC), polyubiquitination, and MuRF-1 were detected by western blot. Myotube diameter was also evaluated. In vivo analysis included the muscle strength, fibre diameter, MHC and MuRF-1 levels by western blot, and ROS levels by DCF probe detection. Results: The results showed that Ang-(1-7) prevented the increase in MuRF-1 and polyubiquitined protein levels, the decrease of MHC levels, the myotubes/fibre diameter diminution, and the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by TGF-β1. Utilizing A779 inhibited the anti-atrophic effect of Ang-(1-7). Conclusion: The preventive effect of Ang-(1-7) on skeletal muscle atrophy induced by TGF-β1 is produced through inhibition of ROS production and proteasomal degradation of MHC.']"

To address these issues, SLAM solutions have been proposed based on the Random Finite Set (RFS) framework, which models the map and measurements such that the usual requirements of external data association routines and map management heuristics can be circumvented and realistic sensor detection uncertainty can be taken into account. Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF)-based RFS SLAM solutions have been demonstrated using the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter and subsequently the Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter. In multi-target tracking, the LMB filter, which was introduced as an efficient approximation to the computationally expensive δ -Generalized LMB ( δ -GLMB) filter, converts its representation of an LMB distribution to δ -GLMB form during the measurement update step. This not only results in a loss of information yielding inferior results (compared to the δ -GLMB filter) but also fails to take computational advantages in parallelized implementations possible with RBPF-based SLAM algorithms. Similar to state-of-the-art random vector-valued RBPF solutions such as FastSLAM and MH-FastSLAM, the performances of all RBPF-based SLAM algorithms based on the RFS framework also diverge from ground truth over time due to random sampling approaches, which only rely on control noise variance. Further, the methods lose particle diversity and diverge over time as a result of particle degeneracy. To alleviate this problem and further improve the quality of map estimates, a SLAM solution using an optimal kernel-based particle filter combined with an efficient variant of the δ -GLMB filter ( δ -GLMB-SLAM) is presented. The performance of the proposed δ -GLMB-SLAM algorithm, referred to as δ -GLMB-SLAM2.0, was demonstrated using simulated datasets and a section of the publicly available KITTI dataset. The results suggest that even with a limited number of particles, δ -GLMB-SLAM2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art RBPF-based RFS SLAM algorithms.']"

In this paper, we combine these two notions in a single cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed general parameterization for the bulk viscosity ξ. By employing dynamical system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the ΛCDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of cosmological observations.', 'TITLE: Dynamical systems applied to cosmology: Dark energy and modified gravity | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The Nobel Prize winning confirmation in 1998 of the accelerated expansion of our Universe put into sharp focus the need of a consistent theoretical model to explain the origin of this acceleration. As a result over the past two decades there has been a huge theoretical and observational effort into improving our understanding of the Universe. The cosmological equations describing the dynamics of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe are systems of ordinary differential equations, and one of the most elegant ways these can be investigated is by casting them into the form of dynamical systems. This allows the use of powerful analytical and numerical methods to gain a quantitative understanding of the cosmological dynamics derived by the models under study. In this review we apply these techniques to cosmology. We begin with a brief introduction to dynamical systems, fixed points, linear stability theory, Lyapunov stability, centre manifold theory and more advanced topics relating to the global structure of the solutions. Using this machinery we then analyse a large number of cosmological models and show how the stability conditions allow them to be tightly constrained and even ruled out on purely theoretical grounds. We are also able to identify those models which deserve further in depth investigation through comparison with observational data. This review is a comprehensive and detailed study of dynamical systems applications to cosmological models focusing on the late-time behaviour of our Universe, and in particular on its accelerated expansion. In self contained sections we present a large number of models ranging from canonical and non-canonical scalar fields, interacting models and non-scalar field models through to modified gravity scenarios. Selected models are discussed in detail and interpreted in the context of late-time cosmology.', 'TITLE: Study of a Viscous ΛWDM Model: Near-Equilibrium Condition, Entropy Production, and Cosmological Constraints | KEYWORDS: cosmological constant; cosmological model; dark matter; viscosity | ABSTRACT: Extensions to a (Formula presented.) DM model have been explored in order to face current tensions that occur within its framework, which encompasses broadening the nature of the dark matter (DM) component to include warmness and a non-perfect fluid description. In this paper, we investigated the late-time cosmological evolution of an exact solution recently found in the literature, which describes a viscous warm (Formula presented.) DM model ((Formula presented.) WDM) with a DM component that obeys a polytropic equation of state (EoS), which experiences dissipative effects with a bulk viscosity proportional to its energy density, with proportionality constant (Formula presented.). This solution has the particularity of having a very similar behavior to the (Formula presented.) CDM model for small values of (Formula presented.), evolving also to a de Sitter type expansion in the very far future. We explore firstly the thermodynamic consistences of this solution in the framework of Eckart’s theory of non-perfect fluids, focusing on the fulfillment of the two following conditions: (i) the near-equilibrium condition and (ii) the positiveness of the entropy production. We explore the range of parameters of the model that allow to fulfill these two conditions at the same time, finding that a viscous WDM component is compatible with both ones, being in this sense, a viable model from the thermodynamic point of view. Furthermore, we constrained the free parameters of the model with the observational data coming from supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) and the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD), using these thermodynamics analyses to define the best priors for the cosmological parameters related to the warmness and the dissipation of the DM, showing that this viscous (Formula presented.) WDM model can describe the combined SNe Ia+OHD data in the same way as the (Formula presented.) CDM model. The cosmological constraint at (Formula presented.) CL gives us an upper limit on the bulk viscous constant of order (Formula presented.) Pa·s, which is in agreement with some previous investigations. Our results support that the inclusion of a dissipative WDM, as an extension of the standard cosmological model, leads to a both thermodynamically consistent and properly fitted cosmological evolution.']"

In this sense, the metallic Ni catalysts supported on mesoporous TiO2 (anatase) substrate demonstrated to be very active and 100% selective in the liquid phase hydrogenation of maleic anhydride (MA) to succinic anhydride (SA). The catalysts, which were prepared via wet impregnation method with different Ni loading (5, 10 and 15 wt.%), were characterized by chemical analysis (ICP-AES), N2 physical adsorption-\u200bdesorption, H2-\u200btemperature programmed reduction (H2-\u200bTPR)\u200b, X-ray diffraction (XRD)\u200b, high resolution transmission electron spectroscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Ni species interaction with support was investigated by TPR and by performing five catalyst recycling tests. After catalyst activation by reduction, the increase of Ni particle size with an increase of Ni loading was relatively small (from 6.9 to 8.9 nm) due to enhance of the metal-support interaction. After the first catalytic cycle, the optimized 5%Ni/TiO2 catalyst showed a small decrease in the Ni loading attributed to metal leaching during time course of reaction. Besides this, the 5%Ni/TiO2 catalyst exhibited a good stability during five continuous cycles with a very high yield of SA after 5 cycles. Finally, temperature experiments performed for the best system shown that the reaction temperature does not affect the SA selectivity in the temperature range studied (323 K–398 K).', 'TITLE: Solvent-Free Hydrogenation of Squalene Using Parts per Million Levels of Palladium Supported on Carbon Nanotubes: Shift from Batch Reactor to Continuous-Flow System | KEYWORDS: heterogeneous catalysis; hydrogenation; nanotubes; palladium; terpenoids | ABSTRACT: The transition from batch catalytic processes to continuous flow processes requires highly active and stable catalysts that still need to be developed. The preparation and characterization of catalysts where palladium single atoms and nanoparticles are simultaneously present on carbon nanotubes were recently reported by us. These catalysts are considerably more active than commercial or previously described catalysts for the liquid phase hydrogenation of terpenes. Herein is shown that under solvent-free conditions, squalene (SQE) could be converted into squalane (SQA,>98 %) using only 300 ppm of Pd in less than 1.4 h at 20 bar H2 and 120 °C. Catalyst stability was assessed in a lab-scale flow reactor, and long-term experiments led to turnover number (TON) higher than 300000 without any detectable loss in the activity. Then, the implementation of this catalyst in a commercial intensified continuous-flow milli-reactor pilot was achieved. High purity SQA (>98 %) could be obtained by continuous hydrogenation of solvent-free SQE at 180 °C and 30 bar H2 with a contact time below 15 min. A production capacity of 3.6 kg per day of SQA could be obtained with an effective reactor volume (VR) of 43.2 mL for this complex 3 phase reaction. Large-scale production can now be foreseen thanks to seamless scale-up provided by the continuous flow pilot supplier.', 'TITLE: Deactivation of Pd/C catalysts by irreversible loss of hydrogen spillover ability of the carbon support | KEYWORDS: Carbon nanotube support; Deactivation; H-spillover; Palladium; Solvent-free hydrogenation | ABSTRACT: General interest in solvent-free catalytic processes is driven by the development of environmentally and economically acceptable procedures. Such processes require the use of highly active and stable catalysts. This study reports on the synthesis, characterization, and kinetic evaluation of two highly active Pd catalysts supported on different carbons support, i.e., multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) and few-layer graphene (FLG). These catalysts, with similar Pd loading (∼2 wt%) and containing both Pd single atoms (PdSA) and nanoparticles (PdNP), were systematically tested for solvent-free total hydrogenation of squalene (SQE) to obtain high-purity squalane (SQA). Thanks to the unique cooperative catalysis between PdSA and PdNP involving H-spillover, the activities of both catalysts were high compared to catalysts described in the literature. Solvent-free total hydrogenation of SQE could be performed under mild conditions (120 °C, 20 bar H2, 4 h) using ultralow Pd loading (60 ppm). However, since this reduction reaction is highly exothermic (ΔHR= − 765 kJ.mol−1), heat management during the reactor operation with these highly active catalysts is crucial to avoid deactivation and thermal runaway. Under these conditions, Pd/FLG was highly active but deactivated, unlike Pd/CNT, which still has high activity, but does not deactivate. Characterizations (ICP, XPS, Raman, TPD-MS, HAADF-STEM) of the Pd/FLG catalyst before and after reaction, supported by calculations based on density functional theory, allowed us to propose a new mechanism of catalyst deactivation involving the chemical reduction of specific surface oxygen groups of the carbon support induced by H-spillover.']"

Soil biological properties such as enzyme activities (EAs) are good indicators of metal(loid) contamination due to their high sensitivity, fast response, and low-cost. Here, the effect of metal(loid) contamination on physicochemical properties and microbial functionality in soils sampled from within 10 km of a Cu smelter is investigated. Soil composite samples were randomly taken within 2, 4, 6, 8 and10 km zones from a mining industry Cu smelter. The EAs of dehydrogenase (DHA), arylsulfatase (ARY), β-glucosidase, urease, and arginine ammonification (AA) were studied as indicators of metal(loid) contamination, which included the ecological dose (ED50) with respect to Cu and As contents. The community level physiological profile (CLPP), functional diversity, and catabolic evenness were evaluated based on the C-substrate utilisation. All EAs decreased in zones with high degrees of metal(loid) contamination, which also had low TOC and clay contents, reflecting long term processes of soil degradation. Positive and strong relationships between EAs and TOC were found. DHA and ARY activities decreased by approximately 85–90% in highly metal(loid) contaminated soils. DHA and AA showed significant ED50 values associated with available Cu (112.8 and 121.6 mg CuDTPA kg−1, respectively) and total As contents (30.8 and 31.8 mg As kg−1, respectively). The CLPP showed different metabolic profiles along the metal(loid) contamination gradients. Long-term stress conditions in soils close to industrial areas resulted in the decreasing of general biological activity, catabolic capacity, and functional diversity.', 'TITLE: Effects of biochar on copper immobilization and soil microbial communities in a metal-contaminated soil | KEYWORDS: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Biochar; Contamination; Copper; Immobilization; Microorganism | ABSTRACT: Purpose: Copper (Cu) contamination has been increasing in land ecosystems. Biochars (BCs) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are known to bind metals, and metallophyte can remove metals from soils. Will BC in combination with AMF contain the Cu uptake by a metallophyte growing in a metal-contaminated soil? The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of BCs on the Cu immobilization and over soil microbial communities in a metal-contaminated soil in the presence of AMF and metallophyte. Materials and methods: Two BCs were produced from chicken manure (CMB) and oat hull (OHB). A Cu-contaminated sandy soil (338 mg kg−1) was incubated with CMB and OHB (0, 1, and 5 % w/w) for 2 weeks. Metallophyte Oenothera picensis was grown in pots (500 mL) containing the incubated soils in a controlled greenhouse for 6 months. A number of analyses were conducted after the harvest. These include plant biomass weight, microbial basal respiration, and dehydrogenase activity (DHA), AMF root colonization, spore number, and glomalin production; changes in fungal and bacterial communities, Cu fractions in soil phases, and Cu uptake in plant tissues. Results and discussion: The BCs increased the soil pH, decreased easily exchangeable fraction of Cu, and increased organic matter and residual fraction of Cu. The BCs provided favorable habitat for microorganisms, thereby increasing basal respiration. The CMB increased DHA by ∼62 and ∼574 %, respectively, for the low and high doses. Similarly, the OHB increased soil microbial activity by ∼68 and ∼72 %, respectively, for the low and high doses. AMF root colonization, spore number, and total glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) production increased by ∼3, ∼2, and ∼3 times, respectively, in soils treated with 1 % OHB. Despite being a metalophyte, O. picensis could not uptake Cu efficiently. Root and shoot Cu concentrations decreased or changed insignificantly in most BC treatments. Conclusions: The results show that the BCs decreased bioavailable Cu, decreased Cu uptake by O. picensis, improved habitat for microorganisms, and enhanced plant growth in Cu-contaminated soil. This suggests that biochars may be utilized to remediate Cu-contaminated soils.', 'TITLE: Effects of biochar on copper immobilization and soil microbial communities in a metal-contaminated soil | KEYWORDS: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Biochar; Contamination; Copper; Immobilization; Microorganism | ABSTRACT: Purpose: Copper (Cu) contamination has been increasing in land ecosystems.

However, one of the main disadvantages of this kind of energy source is their highly variability. The main source of variability is, of course, the day/night cycle. Nevertheless, short-term effects such as cloud shadowing and supply interruptions and long-term effects such as dust accumulation, seasonal variation and ageing of panels will also appear as sources of variability. The combined effect of all these variability sources makes the analysis of the power production data very complex. The reliability and accuracy of this data analysis could becomes significant because it is required to expand the PV plant size, to design a new one, to incorporate energy storage for power smoothing or to economically evaluate the PV system. This work presents a methodology to obtain statistically consistent data from a PV plant, in order to evaluate all the mentioned effects separately. The method is based on the correlation of PV power production data with an ideal value of solar power obtained from geographical and astronomical data. The proposed methodology is applied to data obtained from a PV plant located in northern Chile. © 2014 IEEE.']"

Unfortunately, CTG analysis is difficult, and the interpretation problems are mainly associated with the analysis of FHR decelerations. From that perspective, several approaches have been proposed to improve its analysis; however, the results obtained are not satisfactory enough for their implementation in clinical practice. Current clinical research indicates that a correct CTG assessment requires a good understanding of the fetal compensatory mechanisms. In previous works, we have shown that the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, in combination with time-varying autoregressive modeling, may be useful for the analysis of those characteristics. In this work, based on this methodology, we propose to analyze the FHR deceleration episodes separately. The main hypothesis is that the proposed feature extraction strategy applied separately to the complete signal, deceleration episodes, and resting periods (between contractions), improves the CTG classification performance compared with the analysis of only the complete signal. Results reveal that by considering the complete signal, the classification performance achieved 81.7% quality. Then, including information extracted from resting periods, it improved to 83.2%.', 'TITLE: Cardiotocographic Signal Feature Extraction through CEEMDAN and Time-Varying Autoregressive Spectral-Based Analysis for Fetal Welfare Assessment | KEYWORDS: Biomedical signal processing; cardiotocograph; empirical mode decomposition; fetal heart rate; spectral analysis; time-varying autoregressive modeling | ABSTRACT: Cardiotocograph (CTG) is a widely used tool for fetal surveillance during labor, which provides the joint recording of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction data. Unfortunately, the CTG interpretation is difficult because it involves a visual analysis of highly complex signals. Recent clinical research indicates that a correct CTG assessment requires a good understanding of the fetal compensatory mechanisms modulated by the autonomic nervous system. Certainly, this modulation reflects variations in the FHR, whose characteristics can involve significant information about the fetal condition. The main contribution of this work is to investigate these characteristics by a new approach combining two signal processing methods: The complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and time-varying autoregressive (TV-AR) modeling. The idea is to study the CEEMDAN intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) in both the time-domain and the spectral-domain in order to extract information that can help to assess the fetal condition. For this purpose, first, the FHR signal is decomposed, and then for each IMF, the TV-AR spectrum is computed in order to study their spectral dynamics over time. In this paper, we first explain the foundations of our proposed features. Then, we evaluate their performance in CTG classification by using three machine learning classifiers. The proposed approach has been evaluated on real CTG data extracted from the CTU-UHB database. Results show that by using only conventional FHR features, the classification performance achieved 78, 0%.

Computational modeling can provide mechanistic insight into the onset and propagation of drug-induced arrhythmias, but the effect of drugs on the mechanical performance of the heart remains poorly understood. Here we establish a multiphysics framework that integrates the biochemical, electrical, and mechanical effects of drugs, from cellular excitation to cardiac contraction. For the example of the drug dofetilide, we show that drug concentrations of 5x and 8x increase the heart rate to 122 and 114 beats per minute, increase myofiber stretches by 5%, and decrease overall tissue relaxation by 6%. This results in inter-ventricular and atrial-ventricular dyssynchronies and changes in cardiac output by - 2.5 % and +7%. Our results emphasize the need for multiphysics modeling to better understand the mechanical implications of drug-induced arrhythmias. Knowing how different drug concentrations affect the performance of the heart has important clinical implications in drug safety evaluation and personalized medicine.']"

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in which the synthesis of poly(itaconate)s containing nitrile groups is reported in the literature. The effect of nitrile groups on the main properties is analyzed. Polymer structures were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 1 H and 13 C NMR.

Dielectric properties were measured using broadband dielectric spectroscopy at different temperatures. Polymers with one or two nitrile groups presented dielectric constant values (at 25 °C and 1 kHz) of around 7 and 12.5, respectively, with relatively low dielectric losses with values below 0.02. BDS measurements showed notorious sub-glass transitions attributed to the movement of the dipolar groups under the electric field, even below −100 °C, allowing to achieve dielectric constant values above the average for polymers even at extremely low temperatures.

Water retention curves measured in undisturbed soil samples collected at three depths (10, 20, and 60 cm) and calibrated soil moisture sensors were used to study the water content dynamics under different irrigation schedules (rainfed, 50% and 100% of field capacity) during the summer of 2020 in three types of pastures (Lolium perenne, Bromus valdivianus, and a diverse pasture). The changes in mechanical strength due to defoliation techniques (mowing and grazing) were evaluated by using penetrometers. As the water available in the soil (WAS) increased, the pasture productivity increased as well; however, saving water by restricting its application was feasible (up to 50%) due to the wetting–drying cycles (WD), which showed that when irrigation was applied some of the water infiltrated to deeper horizons. The mechanical strength in the soil under grazed pastures (4500 kPa) was higher as compared to mowed (3900 kPa) pastures. The consideration of the specific physical properties (e.g., plant-available water between 20 and 41% and sensor calibration) permitted a reduction in the amount of water applied with no detrimental effects in pasture productivity. Irrigation reduced mechanical strength, and irrigated soils proved to be more susceptible to animal trampling; however, when the amount of water applied to the soil was reduced, it could better resist animal trampling.', 'TITLE: Analyzing the impact of grazing and short-term irrigation management on soil mechanical strength of a volcanic ash soil under different types of pastures | KEYWORDS: Andisols; Cattle grazing; Cyclic loading; Field water content/penetration resistance profiles; Pore functions; Soil mechanical properties | ABSTRACT: In southern Chile, there are over 1.3 million ha of pastures on volcanic ash soils. The climate change scenario and the need to increase yields are forcing farmers to increase irrigated surface areas. This implies an intensified soil use that must be analyzed to prevent soil degradation. Therefore, this study analyzed the impact of initial pasture defoliation (mowing and grazing) and short-term irrigation managements on soil structure dependent properties of a volcanic ash soil under different types of pastures. Field penetration resistance (PR) profiles (0–80 cm), soil water content measurements (0–10 cm) and undisturbed soil samples (0–3 cm) displayed the impact of animal trampling due to repeated loading events. Though this experiment did not determine significant interactions such as pasture x defoliation method x applied load, the early developmental stage of this experiment provided a basis for better understanding deformation processes due to animal trampling when different types of pastures are irrigated in the short-term. The plastic deformation caused by loads higher than precompression stress induced an increase in soil mechanical strength (e.g. Pc increased after the first grazing, but not after mowing), affecting the macropore volume and air permeability. The short-term effects (<2 years) showed the incipient consequences of grazing and irrigation: PR increased due to animal trampling (data dispersion: grazed> mowed plots, showing footprint formation after 8 grazing events) and the higher sum of PR in non-irrigated pastures evidenced the increase of the cohesion between particles/aggregates after drying events. Therefore, it can be expected that in the medium-term (3-4 years), animal trampling could lead to significant soil deformation and a progressive increase in soil mechanical strength near the soil surface.', 'TITLE: Analyzing the impact of grazing and short-term irrigation management on soil mechanical strength of a volcanic ash soil under different types of pastures | KEYWORDS: Andisols; Cattle grazing; Cyclic loading; Field water content/penetration resistance profiles; Pore functions; Soil mechanical properties | ABSTRACT: In southern Chile, there are over 1.3 million ha of pastures on volcanic ash soils.

Results: Five case reports included seven patients and eight teeth with a follow-up of 4 to 11 years. The overall risk of bias was high, and the certainty of evidence was very low. The survival rate was 87.5%. Adverse effects included sinus tracts, root resorption, symptomatology, apical periodontitis, and intracanal tissue necrosis. Five out of eight teeth required further intervention after orthodontics.

An electronic search was performed on MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, SciELO, Lilacs, CENTRAL. Comparative clinical studies were included, in which APC was tested for pulp regeneration and radicular development. Selected articles underwent risk-of-bias assessment. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were considered. Three randomized parallel studies and one split-mouth case series were included. One study had low risk of bias and three studies had high risk. A total of 61 immature necrotic teeth were treated in 56 patients. Follow-up ranged between 12 and 18 months. All studies used platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the test group, and one also used platelet-rich fibrin (PRF). After treatment, all teeth of control and experimental groups remained asymptomatic for the entire study duration. Only one study reported response to cold and electric pulp test, showing not significantly better outcomes for the test group. Similarly, periapical healing and apical closure were improved in the group treated with APC although statistical significance was not achieved (P = 0.08 and P = 0.06, respectively), probably due to the limited sample size. The teeth treated with PRP achieved significantly better thickening of the dentin walls (P = 0.01), and root lengthening (P = 0.001) than control teeth. Despite the potential effectiveness of APC in promoting root development of necrotic immature teeth, scarce evidence exists regarding this subject. In the studies evaluated in this review, platelet concentrates showed promising results that warrant further investigation.']"

Specific plant growth promoting rhizobacteria have been reported to stimulate growth and tolerance to abiotic stress in plants, and molecular mechanisms like phytohormone synthesis and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deamination are usual candidates proposed to mediate these bacterial effects. Paraburkholderia phytofirmans PsJN is able to promote growth of several plant hosts, and improve their tolerance to chilling, drought and salinity. This work investigated bacterial determinants involved in PsJN stimulation of growth and salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana, showing bacteria enable plants to survive long-term salinity treatment, accumulating less sodium within leaf tissues relative to non-inoculated controls. Inactivation of specific bacterial genes encoding ACC deaminase, auxin catabolism, N-acyl-homoserine-lactone production, and flagellin synthesis showed these functions have little influence on bacterial induction of salinity tolerance. Volatile organic compound emission from strain PsJN was shown to reproduce the effects of direct bacterial inoculation of roots, increasing plant growth rate and tolerance to salinity evaluated both in vitro and in soil. Furthermore, early exposure to VOCs from P. phytofirmans was sufficient to stimulate long-term effects observed in Arabidopsis growth in the presence and absence of salinity. Organic compounds were analyzed in the headspace of PsJN cultures, showing production of 2-undecanone, 7-hexanol, 3-methylbutanol and dimethyl disulfide. Exposure of A. thaliana to different quantities of these molecules showed that they are able to influence growth in a wide range of added amounts. Exposure to a blend of the first three compounds was found to mimic the effects of PsJN on both general growth promotion and salinity tolerance. To our knowledge, this is the first report on volatile compound-mediated induction of plant abiotic stress tolerance by a Paraburkholderia species.']"

The distributions are measured as a function of jet transverse momentum and rapidity. The analysis utilises an integrated luminosity of 0.14 nb-1 of Pb+Pb data and 4.0 pb-1 of pp data collected in 2011 and 2013, respectively, at the same centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per colliding nucleon pair. The distributions measured in pp collisions are used as a reference for those measured in Pb+Pb collisions in order to evaluate the impact on the internal structure of jets from the jet energy loss of fast partons propagating through the hot, dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions. Modest but significant centrality-dependent modifications of fragmentation functions in Pb+Pb collisions with respect to those in pp collisions are seen.

Mosaicism for presence of cells with either methylated FM or smaller unmethylated pre-mutation (PM: CGG 55-199) alleles in the same individual have been associated with better cognitive functioning. This study compares age- and sex-matched FM-only and PM/FM mosaic individuals on intellectual functioning, ASD features and maladaptive behaviours. Methods: This study comprised a large international cohort of 126 male and female participants with FXS (aged 1.15 to 43.17 years) separated into FM-only and PM/FM mosaic groups (90 males, 77.8% FM-only; 36 females, 77.8% FM-only). Intellectual functioning was assessed with age appropriate developmental or intelligence tests. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition was used to examine ASD features while the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community assessed maladaptive behaviours. Results: Comparing males and females (FM-only + PM/FM mosaic), males had poorer intellectual functioning on all domains (p < 0.0001). Although females had less ASD features and less parent-reported maladaptive behaviours, these differences were no longer significant after controlling for intellectual functioning. Participants with PM/FM mosaicism, regardless of sex, presented with better intellectual functioning and less maladaptive behaviours compared with their age- and sex-matched FM-only counterparts (p < 0.05). ASD features were similar between FM-only and PM/FM mosaics within each sex, after controlling for overall intellectual functioning. Conclusions: Males with FXS had significantly lower intellectual functioning than females with FXS. However, there were no significant differences in ASD features and maladaptive behaviours, after controlling for intellectual functioning, independent of the presence or absence of mosaicism. This suggests that interventions that primarily target cognitive abilities may in turn reduce the severity of maladaptive behaviours including ASD features in FXS.', 'TITLE: Tissue mosaicism, FMR1 expression and intellectual functioning in males with fragile X syndrome | KEYWORDS: DNA methylation; epigenetics; FMR1; fragile X syndrome; intellectual disability; mosaicism | ABSTRACT: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by hypermethylation of the FMR1 promoter due to the full mutation expansion (full mutation [FM]: CGG ≥ 200 repeats) and silencing of FMR1. Assessment of mosaicism for active-unmethylated alleles has prognostic utility. This study examined relationships between FMR1 methylation in different tissues with FMR1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and intellectual functioning in 87 males with FXS (1.89–43.17 years of age). Methylation sensitive Southern blot (mSB) and Methylation Specific-Quantitative Melt Aanalysis (MS-QMA) were used to examine FMR1 methylation. FMR1 mRNA levels in blood showed strong relationships with FMR1 methylation assessed using MS-QMA in blood (n = 68; R2 = 0.597; p = 1.4 × 10−10) and buccal epithelial cells (BEC) (n = 62; R2 = 0.24; p = 0.003), with these measures also showing relationships with intellectual functioning scores (p < 0.01). However, these relationships were not as strong for mSB, with ~40% of males with only FM alleles that were 100% methylated and non-mosaic by mSB, showing methylation mosaicism by MS-QMA. This was confirmed through presence of detectable levels of FMR1 mRNA in blood. In summary, FMR1 methylation levels in blood and BEC examined by MS-QMA were significantly associated with FMR1 mRNA levels and intellectual functioning in males with FXS. These relationships were not as strong for mSB, which underestimated prevalence of mosaicism.', 'TITLE: Incomplete silencing of full mutation alleles in males with fragile X syndrome is associated with autistic features | KEYWORDS: Autism; FMR1 mRNA; Fragile X syndrome; Intellectual disability; Mosaicism | ABSTRACT: Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common monogenic cause of intellectual disability with autism features. While it is caused by loss of the FMR1 product (FMRP), mosaicism for active and inactive FMR1 alleles, including alleles termed premutation (PM: 55-199 CGGs), is not uncommon. Importantly, both PM and active full mutation (FM: ≥ 200 CGGs) alleles often express elevated levels of mRNA that are thought to be toxic. This study determined if complete FMR1 mRNA silencing from FM alleles and/or levels of FMR1 mRNA (if present) in blood are associated with intellectual functioning and autism features in FXS. Methods: The study cohort included 98 participants (70.4% male) with FXS (FM-only and PM/FM mosaic) aged 1-43 years. A control group of 14 females were used to establish control FMR1 mRNA reference range. Intellectual functioning and autism features were assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning or an age-appropriate Wechsler Scale and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition (ADOS-2), respectively. FMR1 mRNA was analysed in venous blood collected at the time of assessments, using the real-time PCR relative standard curve method. Results: Females with FXS had significantly higher levels of FMR1 mRNA (p < 0.001) than males. FMR1 mRNA levels were positively associated with age (p < 0.001), but not with intellectual functioning and autistic features in females. FM-only males (aged < 19 years) expressing FM FMR1 mRNA had significantly higher ADOS calibrated severity scores compared to FM-only males with completely silenced FMR1 (p = 0.011). However, there were no significant differences between these subgroups on intellectual functioning. In contrast, decreased levels of FMR1 mRNA were associated with decreased intellectual functioning in FXS males (p = 0.029), but not autism features, when combined with the PM/FM mosaic group. Conclusion: Incomplete silencing of toxic FM RNA may be associated with autistic features, but not intellectual functioning in FXS males. While decreased levels of mRNA may be more predictive of intellectual functioning than autism features. If confirmed in future studies, these findings may have implications for patient stratification, outcome measure development, and design of clinical and pre-clinical trials in FXS.']"

Hv1 are exquisitely selective for protons and their structure is homologous to the voltage sensing domain (VSD) of other voltage-gated ion channels like sodium, potassium, and calcium channels. In clear contrast to the classical voltage-dependent channels, Hv1 lacks a pore domain and thus permeation necessarily occurs through the voltage sensing domain. Hv1 channels are activated by depolarizing voltages, and increases in internal proton concentration. It has been proposed that local conformational changes of the transmembrane segment S4, driven by depolarization, trigger the molecular rearrangements that open Hv1. However, it is still unclear how the electromechanical coupling is achieved between the VSD and the potential pore, allowing the proton flux from the intracellular to the extracellular side. Here we provide a revised view of voltage activation in Hv1 channels, offering a comparative scenario with other voltage sensing channels domains.', 'TITLE: Mechanism of voltage sensing in Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ (BK) channels | KEYWORDS: allosterism; BK channels; potassium channels; voltage sensitivity | ABSTRACT: In neurosecretion, allosteric communication between voltage sensors and Ca2+ binding in BK channels is crucially involved in damping excitatory stimuli. Nevertheless, the voltage-sensing mechanism of BK channels is still under debate. Here, based on gating current measurements, we demonstrate that two arginines in the transmembrane segment S4 (R210 and R213) function as the BK gating charges. Significantly, the energy landscape of the gating particles is electrostatically tuned by a network of salt bridges contained in the voltage sensor domain (VSD). Molecular dynamics simulations and proton transport experiments in the hyperpolarization-activated R210H mutant suggest that the electric field drops off within a narrow septum whose boundaries are defined by the gating charges. Unlike Kv channels, the charge movement in BK appears to be limited to a small displacement of the guanidinium moieties of R210 and R213, without significant movement of the S4.', 'TITLE: Voltage-dependent BK and Hv1 channels expressed in non-excitable tissues: New therapeutics opportunities as targets in human diseases | KEYWORDS: BK channel; Hv1 channel; Phagocytosis; Potassium secretion; Voltage-dependent potassium channels; Voltage-dependent proton channel | ABSTRACT: Voltage-gated ion channels are the molecular determinants of cellular excitability. This group of ion channels is one of the most important pharmacological targets in excitable tissues such as nervous system, cardiac and skeletal muscle. Moreover, voltage-gated ion channels are expressed in non-excitable cells, where they mediate key cellular functions through intracellular biochemical mechanisms rather than rapid electrical signaling. This review aims at illustrating the pharmacological impact of these ion channels, highlighting in particular the structural details and physiological functions of two of them - the high conductance voltage- and Ca2+-gated K+ (BK) channels and voltage-gated proton (Hv1) channels- in non-excitable cells. BK channels have been implicated in a variety of physiological processes ranging from regulation of smooth muscle tone to modulation of hormone and neurotransmitter release. Interestingly, BK channels are also involved in modulating K+ transport in the mammalian kidney and colon epithelium with a potential role in the hyperkalemic phenotype observed in patients with familial hyperkalemic hypertension type 2, and in the pathophysiology of hypertension. In addition, BK channels are responsible for resting and stimulated Ca2+-activated K+ secretion in the distal colon. Hv1 channels have been detected in many cell types, including macrophages, blood cells, lung epithelia, skeletal muscle and microglia. These channels have a central role in the phagocytic system. In macrophages, Hv1 channels participate in the generation of reactive oxygen species in the respiratory burst during the process of phagocytosis.']"

As a result of this problem, this research focused on the relevance and value that traditional music can have as a comprehensive and interdisciplinary learning tool in formal music education. The research analyzed the implementation and results of a proposal for the sixth year of basic education with a pedagogical approach based on the idea that the music that we transfer to formal education cannot be separated from the experiences, activities, knowledge and socio-cultural implications that give them meaning in their contexts of origin. Through collaborative action research, the proposal was carried out in four centers and the perceptions of the collaborating teaching staff were analyzed. The results show that the inclusion of these types of music can enrich the learning process from an integrating conception of knowledge, considering the indivisibility of the music-context-society triad.']"

The oxidation method was based on an anodic treatment, through a time- and potential-controlled electrolysis, in NaOH 0.1 M. This treatment increased the activity in all pH values that were studied, being the pH 8.0 as the best one. It was possible to calculate the kinetic parameters, where the number of transferred electrons calculated was one, and Tafel slope was 70 mV per decade. With these values, a reaction mechanism was postulated. At the best experimental conditions, the electrode has a good behavior as an amperometric sensor versus nitrite oxidation. The system follows linearity in all the range of concentrations and allowed the calculation of analytical parameters such as detection limit, quantification limit, accuracy, and exactitude.

For this purpose, glassy carbon electrodes (GC) were modified with CoII and FeIII octaethylporphyrins. The system that presents the highest electrocatalytic activity towards ORR is GC modified with a mixture of both octaethylporphyrins in 1:1 volume proportion (GC Co-Fe 1:1) over the GC electrodes modified with CoII and FeIII octaethylporphyrins separately. This modified electrode can reduce O2 through two reduction processes (four electrons each), by the generation of H2O as final product, in two active sites of different chemical nature. All the electrodic systems were morphologically characterized by atomic-force microscopy (AFM) and electrically characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

A systematic search was performed using PubMed, WoS, EMBASE, Science Direct and SCOPUS databases. The inclusion criteria were experimental studies in animal models that evaluated the use of PRP as a treatment for TMJ-OA with or without arthrocentesis/arthroscopy. Comparison was made to a healthy control group or to other treatment. The variables evaluated were the histological effects of the treatments, characteristics of the primary articles, characteristics of the sample studied and the risk of bias. The systematic search identified 120 studies. Eventually 5 studies were included in the analysis. Four of the studies showed a statistically significant repair in joint tissues and improvement of cartilage thickness in animals treated with PRP. The global risk of bias was unclear. The results of this systematic review suggest that PRP treatment in TMJ-OA has benefits at the histological level in cartilage, articular disc and articular bone tissue in animal models.

Material and methods: An experimental study was conducted on 38 rabbit TMJs. The effect of different hyaluronic acids was compared at 30 and 135 days. Histopathological analysis was performed. Cartilage damage was assessed with the OARSI scale. Results: The severity of the induced OA according to OARSI was 3.4 degrees in the mandibular condyle (MC) and 3.2 in the mandibular fossa (MF); the articular disc (AD) presented disorganization of the collagen fibers, with randomly arranged hypertrophic chondrocytes. At 30 days, untreated TMJs worsened. TMJ treated with LMW-HA reduced its severity to 1.5 degrees in MC and 1.6 in MF, the AD presented histological aspects within normal limits. TMJ treated with HMW-HA presented 2.4 degrees in MC and 2.2 in MF, the AD maintained characteristics similar to the group with OA. At 135 days, all groups worsened. Conclusion: Exogenous HA is effective in the management of TMJ-OA induced in rabbits, showing cartilage and articular disc repair at 30 days. The LMW-HA group had better effects on joint tissue than HMW-HA 30 days after treatment. However, at 135 days, both groups presented regression of joint tissue repair.

The TMJ has characteristics that give it special adaptation and recovery abilities, where HA plays a fundamental role in helping to maintain joint homeostasis, which is affected in pathological processes like OA. OA is a chronic degenerative multi-factor disease that can affect all the components of the synovial joints, causing degradation of the articular cartilage, extracellular matrix and breakage in the HA molecules. HA is a non-branched linear polysaccharide with viscosupplementation, anti-inflammatory, lubrication and pain relief effects; it also activates the intrinsic repair processes of the cartilage and normalizes the endogenous production of HA by the synoviocytes. In recent years, the therapeutic use of HA has shown evidence that supports its application in TMJ OA, improving viscosupplementation capacity, acting at the cellular and molecular levels, reducing various inflammatory mediators and improving the reparative characteristics. Its use has been studied in animal models and in humans. However, no consensus has been reached in terms of concentrations, dose, application frequency or molecular weight to be used.']"

We detail the design of the language and show its features, give an overview of the interpreter and how it enables the liveness properties of the language, and illustrate its independence from specific robot APIs.', ""TITLE: Live programming the behavioral layer of robots | KEYWORDS: Live Programming; Live Robot Programming; Nested State Machines; Robot | ABSTRACT: Robotic development suffers from a long cognitive distance between the code and the resulting behavior. This is due to the several steps necessary to build robotic behaviors: writing the code, compiling it, deploying it and finally testing it on the robot. All this slows down development and can make experimentation prohibitively expensive. In contrast, Live Programming tightens the feedback loop, minimizing the cognitive distance. As a result, programmers benefit from an immediate connection with the program that they are making thanks to an immediate, 'live' feedback of program behavior. This allows for extremely rapid creation, or variation, of robot behavior and for dramatically increased debugging speed. In this research, we fist explore the concept of live programming in the development of robot behaviors. Second, we present how we can validate our approach to improve the development of robotic behaviors.""]"

If ROS concentrations are too great, this can lead to a state of oxidative stress that are detrimental to sperm quality. The aim of this study was to ascertain the profile the ROS production and assess the effects of post-thaw supplementation of a semen extender with different antioxidant compounds on the quality and function variables of frozen-thawed stallion spermatozoa incubated in vitro. Frozen-thawed stallion spermatozoa (2 × 10 6 cells/mL) were incubated with three different antioxidants (MnTBAP, NAC and FeTPPS) for 4 h at 38 °C. An untreated sperm suspension and a fresh sample were included as controls. Plasma membrane integrity (SYBR-14/PI), intracellular ROS concentration (DHE and ROS-ID™ total ROS/Superoxide Detection Kit), lipid peroxidation (BODIPY), DNA damage (TUNEL) and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm; TMRE/SYTOX) were evaluated by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. In addition, sperm motility was evaluated using the ISAS system. Evaluations were performed at 0 and 4 h of incubation. The results indicate that superoxide anion is the main ROS produced by frozen-thawed stallion spermatozoa and that the use of MnTBAP improved sperm motility and viability, decreased the lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. In conclusion, this study provides relevant data to improve in vitro incubations conditions and to establish futures therapies using MnTBAP after thawing with the aim being to overcome the deleterious effects of semen cryopreservation and consequently preserve the stallion sperm quality through avoiding oxidative stress.', 'TITLE: Swine spermatozoa trigger aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps leading to adverse effects on sperm function | KEYWORDS: aggNETs; Boar; Neutrophil extracellular traps; Sperm | ABSTRACT: In pigs, the number of PMN in uterus lumen increases within few hours after natural or artificial AI resulting in early PMN-derived innate immune reactions. Sperm-NETs formation was recently reported to occur in various mammalian species. Aim of this study was to investigate direct interactions of boar spermatozoa with swine PMN, the release of sperm-mediated NETs, and to assess NET-derived effects on sperm functionality. Sperm-triggered NETs were visualized by SEM- and immunofluorescence analyses. Sperm-mediated NETosis was confirmed by presence of extruded DNA with global histones and NE. Largest sizes of sperm-mediated aggNETs were detected after 5 h thereby resulting in effective massive sperm entrapment. The number of aggNETs increased from 3 h onwards. Kinetic studies of swine sperm-mediated NETosis showed to be a time-dependent cellular process. In addition, number of NETs-entrapped spermatozoa increased at 3 h of exposure whilst few free spermatozoa were detected after 3 h. Anchored NETs also increased from 3 h onwards. The cytotoxicity of NETs was confirmed by diminution of the total motility and the progressive motility. Spermatozoa membrane integrity and function loss exposed to NETs was confirmed from 3 h. Experiments revealed NETs-derived damaging effects on swine spermatozoa in membrane integrity, motility and functionality. We hypothesize that swine sperm-triggered aggNETs might play a critical role in reduced fertility potential in swine reproductive technique. Thus, aggNETs formation needs to be considered in future studies about uterine environment as well as advance of sperm in the porcine female reproductive tract.', 'TITLE: Integrity of mitochondrial membrane potential reflects human sperm quality | KEYWORDS: Mitochondrial membrane potential; Phosphatidylserine; Reactive oxygen species; Sperm quality | ABSTRACT: The aim of this work was to evaluate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalisation and mitochondrial membrane potential integrity in the spermatozoa of healthy donors and outpatients who consulted for infertility and to correlate the results with the classic sperm parameters. For the evaluation of intracellular ROS levels, PS externalisation and mitochondrial membrane potential integrity, the fluorescent compounds dihydroethidium, annexin V-FITC and JC-1, respectively, were used and analysed by using flow cytometry. Conventional seminal analysis, including motility, viability, morphology, sperm count and volume, was performed according to the WHO criteria. The mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS results showed significant differences between the spermatozoa of individuals with a normal semen analysis and those of the group presenting abnormality in at least one of the sperm parameters. Mitochondrial membrane potential showed a significant and direct correlation with all the sperm parameters analysed. ROS were inversely correlated with motility, viability and morphology. PS externalisation, however, did not show any differences between the two groups, nor was it correlated with the sperm parameters examined. The evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential integrity is a test that reflects sperm quality, which makes it highly recommendable to be applied as a complement to routine sperm analyses. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']"

This study was approved by the Central Metropolitan Ethics Committee. Patients attended 10 structured robot-as-sisted therapy sessions, working collaboratively in pairs. Workshop attendance and parent and child satisfaction were evaluated through surveys, the adaptive behavior with the Vineland scale, and social interaction with video coding guidelines. Results: Patients presented a very good adherence and satisfaction with the activity. There was an improvement in socialization behaviors and social age. Video-coding showed an increase in social interaction and improvement in the behavior of the patients after attending workshops.

Cross-section measurements for the production of a Higgs boson through gluon-gluon fusion, vectorboson fusion, and in association with a vector boson or a top-quark pair are reported. The signal strength, defined as the ratio of the observed to the expected signal yield, is measured for each of these production processes as well as inclusively. The global signal strength measurement of 0.99 ± 0.14 improves on the precision of the ATLAS measurement at √s = 7 and 8 TeV by a factor of two. Measurements of gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion productions yield signal strengths compatible with the Standard Model prediction. Measurements of simplified template cross sections, designed to quantify the different Higgs boson production processes in specific regions of phase space, are reported. The cross section for the production of the Higgs boson decaying to two isolated photons in a fiducial region closely matching the experimental selection of the photons is measured to be 55 ± 10 fb, which is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 64 ± 2 fb. Furthermore, cross sections in fiducial regions enriched in Higgs boson production in vector-boson fusion or in association with large missing transverse momentum, leptons or top-quark pairs are reported. Differential and double-differential measurements are performed for several variables related to the diphoton kinematics as well as the kinematics and multiplicity of the jets produced in association with a Higgs boson. These differential cross sections are sensitive to higher order QCD corrections and properties of the Higgs boson, such as its spin and CP quantum numbers. No significant deviations from a wide array of Standard Model predictions are observed. Finally, the strength and tensor structure of the Higgs boson interactions are investigated using an effective Lagrangian, which introduces additional CP-even and CP-odd interactions. No significant new physics contributions are observed.', 'TITLE: Measurement of inclusive and differential cross sections in the H → ZZ * → 4ℓ decay channel in pp collisions at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector | KEYWORDS: Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments); Higgs physics | ABSTRACT: Inclusive and differential fiducial cross sections of Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions are measured in the H → ZZ* → 4ℓ decay channel.

The study of trace elements in biotic matrices is a topic of great relevance for the implications that it can have on wildlife and human health. Penguins are very useful, since they live exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere and represent about 90% of the biomass of birds of the Southern Ocean. The levels of trace elements (dry weight) in different biotic matrices of penguins were reviewed here. Maps of trace element records in penguins were included. Data on exposure and effects of trace elements in penguins were collected from the literature. The most reported trace elements in penguins are aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, copper, zinc, and manganese. Trace elements have been measured in 11 of the 18 species of penguins. The most studied biotic matrices are feathers and excreta. Most of the studies have been performed in Antarctica and subantarctic Islands. Little is known about the interaction among metals, which could provide better knowledge about certain mechanisms of detoxification in penguins. Future studies of trace elements in penguins must incorporate other metals such as vanadium, cobalt, nickel, and chromium. Data of metals in the species such as Eudyptes pachyrhynchus, Eudyptes moseleyi, Eudyptes sclateri, Eudyptes robustus, Eudyptes schlegeli, Spheniscus demersus, Spheniscus mendiculus, and Megadyptes antipodes are urged. It is important to correlate levels of metals in different biotic matrices with the effects on different species and in different geographic locations.', 'TITLE: The Impact of Penguins on the Content of Trace Elements and Nutrients in Coastal Soils of North Western Chile and the Antarctic Peninsula Area | KEYWORDS: Biotransport; Heavy metals; Nutrients; Penguins; Seabirds; Soil; Trace metals | ABSTRACT: In isolated areas without direct human impact where several species of seabirds nest, transformations affecting the soil come mainly from natural processes, such as chemical enrichment caused by seabirds. Penguins constitute an important bird biomass in the Southern Hemisphere, where they breed in colonies on different sites from 100 to thousands of individuals. The accumulation of trace elements and nutrients in soils within two perennial colonies of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) located in north western Chile and three colonies of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) in the Antarctic Peninsula area were investigated here. Surface soil samples were collected directly from nesting sites. Control samples were taken outside the colonies within sites adjacent to the nesting areas, but not affected by bird excrement. The contents of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Sr, V and Zn were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Ammonium (NH4) and nitrate (NO3) ions were determined colorimetrically. Extractable potassium (K) was determined by flame emission spectrometry, and available phosphorus (Olsen-P) was determined by spectrophotometry. The highest concentrations of trace metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, V and Zn) and macronutrients (available N, K and P), along with an increase in salinity and acidity levels, were found directly below the seabird colony, a situation occurring in northern Chile as well as in the Antarctic Peninsula area, highlighting the role that penguins have as bio-vectors on generating geochemical changes in different ecosystems. Some terrestrial plants and animals that live near those penguin colonies might be affected at a greater level than the organisms that live in sites similar but distant from colonies of birds. New data about the role of these species of seabirds as bio-vectors of chemical contaminants are added.', 'TITLE: Concentration of fifty-six elements in excreta of penguins from the Antarctic Peninsula area | KEYWORDS: Emerging contaminants; Excrement; Heavy metals; REEs; Seabirds; Southern Hemisphere; Trace elements | ABSTRACT: Seabird feces as indicators of the exposure to environmental contaminants have been studied worldwide. Penguins are indicator species for marine pollution, but their role as biovectors of rare earth elements (REEs) to ecosystems have been little studied. The present study quantified the concentration of REEs and trace elements (TEs) in feces of gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua). Adult penguin excreta from Fildes Bay (King George Island) and Yelcho Base (Palmer Archipelago) were collected and then analyzed by ICP-MS. Among REEs, levels ranged from 0.0038 to 1.02 μg g−1 d.w. for Lu and Ce, respectively. For TEs, the levels varied widely through the sample set, with Al, Fe, Sr, Zn and Ti as the highest mean levels, particularly at Fildes Bay. The data show that gentoo penguins act as a biovector organism by transporting TEs and REEs from the sea to land via excreta, reaffirming that this species acts as an important biovector organism in Antarctic ecosystems. The potential impacts of this process on Antarctic ecosystems needs further research.']"

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays a key role in the regulation of the cholinergic system and particularly in the formation of amyloid plaques; therefore, the inhibition of AChE has become one of the most promising strategies for the treatment of AD, particularly concerning AChE inhibitors that interact with the peripheral anionic site (PAS). Ceanothic acid isolated from the Chilean Rhamnaceae plants is an inhibitor of AChE through its interaction with PAS. In this study, six ceanothic acid derivatives were prepared, and all showed inhibitory activity against AChE. The structural modifications were performed starting from ceanothic acid by application of simple synthetic routes: esterification, reduction, and oxidation. AChE activity was determined by the Ellmann method for all compounds. Kinetic studies indicated that its inhibition was competitive and reversible. According to the molecular coupling and displacement studies of the propidium iodide test, the inhibitory effect of compounds would be produced by interaction with the PAS of AChE.

Fruit showed small, circular, light brown spots that eventually destroyed the entire fruit. Small sporodochia appeared on the fruit surface. Fruit was harvested from orchards located near San Francisco de Mostazal (33°59′ S, 70°41′ W), Chile. Small pieces of diseased tissue were selected from margins of lesions of surface disinfected (96% ethanol) fruit (n = 7) and placed on acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates for 5 days at 20°C. Light brown colonies with even margins and concentric rings of spores were obtained. The conidia of five isolates were one-celled, hyaline, lemon-shaped, (min. 10.7) 14.9 ± 1.5 (max. 18.6) × (min. 8.1) 9.4 ± 0.8 (max. 10.8) μm (n = 30), and borne in branched monilioid chains. This fungus was identified as Monilinia fructicola (G. Winter) Honey (1). Identification was confirmed by amplifying and sequencing the ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region using ITS1 and ITS4 primers (3). BLAST analysis of Chilean plum isolates (GenBank Accession Nos. KF148610 and KF148611) were 99 to 100% identical to isolates of M. fructicola originating from the United States (DQ314727 and HQ846966, respectively) and 100% identical to the first Chilean isolate (JN001480) found in nectarines originating from California at the supermarkets in Santiago in June 2009. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by reproducing brown rot symptoms on mature wounded Japanese plums cv. Angelino (n = 8) inoculated with 10 μl of a conidial suspension (105 conidia/ml) or with a mycelium plug (5-mm diameter). After 2 days in humid chambers (>80% relative humidity) at 25°C, all inoculated fruit developed brown rot symptoms with necrotic lesion means of 15.8 and 21.5 mm in diameter in fruit inoculated with conidia and mycelium, respectively. Non-inoculated control fruit remained healthy. Re-isolations were performed on PDA and the presence of M. fructicola was morphologically confirmed in 100% of the symptomatic fruits. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the presence of M. fructicola causing brown rot in stored Japanese plums in Chile after its first interception in 2009 in Chile, suggesting that this pathogen has been established in the field. Currently, M. fructicola is a quarantine organism under official control, restricted to Prunus orchards between Santiago and Nancagua in central Chile (2). © The American Phytopathological Society."", 'TITLE: Characterization and pathogenicity of botryosphaeriaceae species obtained from avocado trees with branch canker and dieback and from avocado fruit with stem end rot in Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Several species of the Botryosphaeriaceae family have been associated with branch canker, dieback, and stem end rot in avocado (Persea americana Mill.). In Chile, the incidence of diseases affecting the avocado tree increased from 2011 to 2016, which coincided with a severe drought that affected avocado production. Moreover, distant countries importing avocados from Chile also reported an increase of stem end rot of ripe avocados. Therefore, the aims of this study were to identify the pathogen species associated with branch canker, dieback, and stem end rot of avocado in Chile and to study their pathogenicity. This study was conducted between 2015 and 2016 in ‘Hass’ avocado orchards located in the main avocado-producing regions in Chile. A diverse collection of fungal species was recovered from both necrotic woody tissue and necrotic tissue on harvested ripe fruit. On the basis of morphology and phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) and the translation elongation factor 1-a (TEF1-a) gene, eight species in the Botryosphaeriaceae family were identified: Diplodia mutila, D. pseudoseriata, D. seriata, Dothiorella iberica, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Neofusicoccum australe, N. nonquaesitum, and N. parvum. For each of these species, pathogenicity studies were conducted on 1-year-old healthy Hass avocado plants. All isolates produced brown gum exudate and caused necrosis in the vascular system 3 weeks after inoculation. N. nonquaesitum, N. parvum, and D. pseudoseriata were the most virulent species. Necrotic lesions and cavities with white mycelia near the peduncle union were observed on Hass avocado fruit inoculated postharvest. L. theobromae, N. australe, and N. parvum were significantly more virulent than the other tested species in the Botryosphaeriaceae family. This study identified and characterized the pathogenicity of Botryosphaeriaceae species in Chile, which will prove useful to future research on these pathogens directed at establishing effective control strategies in avocado.', 'TITLE: Occurrence of Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis causing speck rot on stored pink lady apple fruit in Chile | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Chilean apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) industry has a production area of 37,207 ha (ODEPA 2015). Recently, speck rot, a new postharvest rot of stored apple caused by Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis Xiao & J.D. Rogers, has been reported in Washington State, U.S.A., and Germany (Kim and Xiao 2006; Weber 2011). Speck rot was observed during storage (150 to 180 days; 0°C) of Pink Lady apples harvested from orchards in Linares (35°52′S; 71°37′W) in the south-central region of Chile during 2014. Speck rot was characterized by an initial light brown skin discoloration that progressed to dark brown to black, with a firm rubbery texture that affected part of the fruit or the entire fruit. Superficial or partially immersed black pycnidia were observed on the surface of the decayed areas. Internally decayed tissue was spongy to firm with a brown-black to black appearance and could not be separated from apparently healthy tissue (Weber 2011). Fifteen diseased fruits were superficially disinfested using 75% ethanol for 30 s and cut. Small fragments (2 to 3 mm in length) were collected from the margins of internal diseased tissues and aseptically placed on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA; 0.5 ml/liter of 92% lactic acid) for 7 days incubation at 20°C. Fifteen light gray to gray colonies with aerial mycelia and showing alternating growth rings were subcultured in APDA. Abundant black pycnidia with cream-colored cirrhi were often present after 7 to 10 days at 20°C in APDA cultures. The conidia on the APDA were smooth, unicellular, hyaline, ellipsoid to lacriform with flattened ends, and (5.2) 6.6 (7.9) µm × (2.9) 3.6 (4.7) µm. Based on morphology, this fungus was identified asPhacidiopycnis washingtonensis Xiao & J.J Rogers (Xiao et al. 2005). Conidia of P. washingtonensis differ in size and shape with P. piris (Xiao et al. 2005). To confirm its identity, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of four isolates (Mz-1, Mz-4, Mz-5, and Mz-9, GenBank Accession Nos. KP759279 to KP759282, respectively) was amplified and sequenced using primer ITS4/ITS5. BLASTn analyses showed 99% identity with P. washingtonensis (ex-type, AY608644). To prove pathogenicity, 12 mature Pink Lady apple fruits were superficially disinfected using 75% ethanol for 30 s and injured with a sterile 5-mm diameter cork borer. Then, apple fruits were inoculated with 40 µl of conidial suspension (106 conidia/ml) of four isolates (Mz-1, Mz-4, Mz-5, and Mz-9). An equal number of fruits treated with 40 µl of sterile water were used as negative controls. The fruits were placed into commercial apple box and incubated at 20°C for 15 days. An additional 12 fruits were disinfested, wounded, and inoculated as described above, including negative controls; however, these fruits were placed in a cold chamber at 0°C for 35 days. All inoculated apple fruits developed necrotic lesions measuring 26.1 to 31.3 mm and 60.1 to 70.4 mm in diameter for 0 and 20°C storage conditions, respectively. The negative controls remained healthy. Reisolations were performed on APDA and the presence of P. washingtonensis was morphologically confirmed in 100% of the symptomatic fruits. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of P. washingtonensis causing speck rot on cold stored apple fruit in Chile and South America. The impact of speck rot on the Chilean apple industry is unknown, but we determined a 0.2 to 13.9% prevalence (n = 9,489 apple fruits) of speck rot on stored Pink Lady apples.']"

Special focus will be placed on the environmental advantages offered by these processes in contrast to conventional ones as heterotrophic denitrification and anammox. In addition, the operational and environmental conditions that promote the development of these microbial populations for nitrogen removal in wastewater will be addressed. Nitrate removal by an autotrophic process using sulfur compounds forms is the better characterized process and has been extensively applied in the treatment of wastewater with low C/N ratios rich in nitrates and sulfides. Hydrogenotrophic denitrification has attracted attention for application to nitrate removal from groundwater and industrial wastewater with very low organic matter content and high nitrate concentrations. This is because the process is clean, with a low biomass production and no residual organic matter.

Froth recovery is affected by a number of variables, including froth stability, particle size and density, and the operating conditions of the flotation cell. Despite its importance, modelling froth recovery is challenging due to the large number of competing effects involved. In this paper, we present a model for froth recovery that takes into account the effects of detachment and subsequent transport of particles. The model is phenomenological and is derived from a set of coupled partial differential equations used to describe both liquid and particle motion within a froth. An analytical algebraic solution is obtained for the froth recovery by making a number of assumptions, which are discussed and justified in the paper. This model is related to a previous model produced by the authors, in which froth recovery was described in terms of a constant particle detachment fraction. Conversely, this enhanced model includes an improved description for particle detachment behaviour during coalescence events, allowing for a variable particle detachment fraction. The key parameters in the model are two dimensionless groups. The first group combines the particle settling velocity, the air addition rate and froth stability parameters such as air recovery and the change in bubble size over the froth, while the second key dimensionless group is the ratio of the surface loading on the incoming bubbles to the maximum surface loading. This model is compared to experimental results and is shown to accurately describe the evolution of the froth recovery behaviour down a bank of cells in response to the decreasing froth stability.', 'TITLE: Effect of impeller design on bubble size and froth stability | KEYWORDS: Bubble size; Design; Flotation; Flotation tank; Foam stability; Froth stability; Impeller; Rotor; Stator | ABSTRACT: Froth flotation is the most widely used mineral separation technique. It is based on the relative hydrophobicity of valuable and gangue particles. In a flotation tank, two distinct zones can be identified: the pulp and the froth. The pulp is a turbulent region in which hydrophobic valuable particles attach to air bubbles while hydrophilic gangue particles remain in the slurry. As the particle-laden bubbles rise, a mineralised froth zone is formed that overflows as a concentrate. Although the process is more than a hundred years old, there remain many aspects that are not completely understood, particularly for the froth zone. Thus, the rules governing the design of flotation tanks tend to focus on pulp zone parameters, which are largely based on operating data. An example of this is the design and operation of impellers. These tend to be designed paying attention to hydrodynamic phenomena in the pulp zone, but their effect on the froth zone has not been completely addressed. The role of impellers in a flotation tank is to break the air bubbles in order to generate smaller ones and to provide an environment that enables the collision between those bubbles and the particles in the slurry. This usually creates turbulent regimes that can affect the pulp-froth interface, destabilising the lower regions of the froth and affecting the overall performance of the process. Different impeller designs and retrofit modifications have been proposed in the past, addressing some of those issues. However, there is no systematic study of the effect of different impeller designs on the bubble size in the pulp and its links to the stability of the froth. This work tested the impact of an impeller designs combined with the use of a stator on the performance of an 87 litres continuously operated laboratory-scale flotation tank, with a focus on bubble size in the pulp and froth stability. The results showed that the implementation of a stator system decreased bubble size and increased froth stability. That resulted in an increase of mass pull, measured as a proxy of metallurgical recovery.', 'TITLE: The effect of impeller-stator design on bubble size: Implications for froth stability and flotation performance | KEYWORDS: Bubble size; Flotation cell design; Froth flotation; Froth stability; Impeller design; Rotor; Rushton; Stator | ABSTRACT: The impeller in a mechanical flotation tank plays a key role in keeping particles in suspension, dispersing and breaking-up air bubbles, and promoting particle-bubble collision. However, the turbulent regime generated by the impeller can also affect the pulp-froth interface, destabilising the lower regions of the froth and affecting the overall flotation performance. The effects that pulp zone design modifications have on the froth are, however, poorly understood and have not been well-studied. In this work, we study the impact of impeller-stator design on the performance of a large laboratory-scale flotation tank. Two different impeller designs, with and without a stator, were assessed under a range of air flow rates to determine changes in pulp bubble size, froth stability, and metallurgical recovery. The results allow us to quantify, for the first time, the reduction in bubble size in a three-phase flotation system and the improvement in froth stability due to the use of a stator, and thus the enhancement in flotation performance. An inverse relationship is found between the pulp bubble size and froth stability. It is shown that the impeller designs that exhibited smaller bubble sizes resulted in higher froth stability values and also higher flotation recoveries. These findings provide insights into the links between pulp and froth zone phenomena, paving the way for improvements in flotation tank design that lead towards flotation optimisation.']"

These alterations in neuronal networking occur at the very onset of AD and may lead to the neuronal loss displayed in later stages of the disease, which is characterized by severe cognitive and behavioral impairments. Many studies suggest that amyloid-β(Aβ) oligomers are responsible for synaptic disconnections and neuronal death. The effects of Aβ in different brain regions are pleotropic, thus suggesting a common mechanism for toxicity. One potential site for this mechanism of toxicity is the neuronal membrane. It is recognized that Aβ can associate to the plasma membrane and induce the formation of pores after the interaction with lipids like GM1 and cholesterol, and proteins such as APP and NMDA receptors. After this early event, the membrane increases its permeability allowing the influx of small ions and larger molecules. Thus, one of the main toxic consequences of Aβ oligomer interaction with neurons is an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that causes alterations in ionic homeostasis. It has been proposed that Aβ perforates the membrane similarly to pore-forming toxins producing a series of effects that include synaptic failure and cell death. These actions of Aβ appear to be potentiated by neuroinflammation, which results in a series of effects that, when prolonged, will affect membrane integrity, pore formation and cellular homeostasis. Here, we will review the most recent data on Aβ actions at the membrane level and how its relationship with neuroinflammation could further potentiate brain impairment in AD. The notion of having drugs acting with dual inhibitory actions, inhibition of membrane damage and inflammation, could serve as a starting conceptual point for the development of new therapies for the disease.']"

The study also proposes to define the role that developmental language disorders play in this relationship. A non-experimental, cross-sectional, and correlational study was carried out with 76 second graders: 26 diagnosed with a developmental language disorder and 50 with normal language development. The children were given a reading comprehension test and two tests of prosodic awareness. The results show significant differences between the two groups in reading comprehension and prosodic stress awareness, and a significant correlation between prosodic stress awareness and reading comprehension. The prosodic stress awareness variable together with the variable of developmental language disorder predict performance in reading comprehension.', 'TITLE: Assessing a pedagogical intervention in visual literacy for reading comprehension of multimodal texts in language and communication pre-service teacher education Evaluación de una intervención pedagógica de alfabetización visual en la comprensión lectora de textos multimodales en programas de formación inicial docente en lenguaje y comunicación | KEYWORDS: Multimodal texts.; Reading comprehension; Visual literacy protocol | ABSTRACT: In approaching multimodal reading from a socio semiotic perspective, we sought for visual literacy strategies to construct a reading protocol. Once the intervention was defined, texts were designed to include textual and multimodal questions. Following a semi experimental design, with pre-service students in Language and Communication education at two universities in Santiago, one group was exposed to the visual literacy protocol and to reading comprehension tests. The other group only responded the tests. Results show no significant differences between groups.

Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) post-stroke may help brain endothelial cells (BECs) counter ischaemic injury. However data on how EVs from ischaemic stroke patients, considering injury severity, affect these cells are limited. The aims were to characterize the inflammatory and angiogenic components of circulating EVs in acute ischaemic stroke patients, considering stroke severity, and to investigate whether these circulating EVs differentially influence the proangiogenic properties and blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity of human BECs. Eighteen ischaemic stroke patients (acute phase: 24–48 h) and nine controls matched by age, sex, and blood pressure were studied. Stroke severity was classified as severe (n = 9) or mild (n = 9). Plasma EVs were analysed for size, concentration, and protein markers (CD63, Alix, CD81, TSG101, HSP70), as well as proinflammatory and angiogenic proteins. EV uptake, cell viability, proangiogenic capacity, electrical resistance [TEER (transendothelial electrical resistance)], and dextran-70 kD permeability were assessed using human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3). Stroke patients had lower EV concentrations than controls (p = 0.075), with mild-stroke patients having the smallest EVs. Stroke-derived EVs had higher levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), nitrotyrosine, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) but lower placental growth factor (PLGF) compared to controls. IL-6 was higher in mild strokes (p = 0.0025), and VEGF was higher in severe strokes (p = 0.048). EVs from severe-stroke cases enhanced proangiogenic capacity and minimally disrupted the BBB. Stroke severity influences EV number, size, and composition. EVs from severe strokes may promote BBB restoration and cerebral angiogenesis, suggesting their role in intercellular communication and homeostasis in ischaemic tissue. (Figure presented.). Key points: Ischaemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. After an ischaemic stroke several physiological processes are triggered to recover the injured tissue. Increasing evidence has suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in the bloodstream could play a role in brain recovery, but their specific impact, especially concerning stroke severity, was unclear. This study demonstrates that plasma-derived EVs from first-ever ischaemic stroke patients have distinctive characteristics and effects over brain angiogenesis and blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Our study proposes that circulating EVs from patients with severe stroke may carry protective factors to initiate brain endothelial cell recovery after acute episodes. These findings underscore the role of EVs as potential effectors of BBB recovery and biomarkers in severe ischaemic stroke.', 'TITLE: New insights in ischemic stroke: Role of antioxidant supplementation | KEYWORDS: Antioxidant defense system; Oxidative stress; Stroke | ABSTRACT: Stroke causes 9% of all deaths around the world and is the second most common cause of death, after ischemic heart disease. Since the majority of stroke cases are non fatal, its major burden is long-term disability among western people. After ischemic stroke, reactive oxygen species have been implicated to play a pivotal role in brain injury. Indeed, evidence reports a rapid increase in oxidative stress-related markers production immediately after acute ischemic stroke and that antioxidant defenses are rapidly overwhelmed, thus allowing further tissue damage. At high concentrations, these free radicals react and damage the cellular macromolecules leading to cell injury and necrosis. On the other hand, lower concentrations of reactive oxygen species behave as mediators in signaling involving mitochondria, DNA repair enzymes, and transcription factors that may lead to apoptosis after cerebral ischemia. When spontaneous reperfusion occurs, rapid restoration of blood flow increases the level of tissue oxygenation, accounting for a burst of reactive oxygen species that leads to the so-called reperfusion injury. Stroke is characterized by an ischemic core (infarct) surrounded by a ""penumbra"" (peri-infarct) region. In the penumbra area, where collateral blood flow can buffer the effects of vessel occlusion, cell death occurs less rapidly via oxidative stress-mediated mechanisms such as apoptosis and inflammation and thus, arises as an emerging target for therapeutic treatment. The currently applied measures to protect the brain against the severe damage caused by stroke have yielded insufficient improvement in the outcome of these patients. Thus, antioxidant strategies that lead to diminution of the oxidative injury are key to investigating new treatments to overcome the consequences of stroke. Evidence on acute antioxidant system enhancement by means of use of NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol, antioxidant vitamins C and E, the polyphenol resveratrol, as well as other antioxidant strategies are reviewed in the setting of stroke. Therefore, we introduce new strategies to be tested to reduce the cerebral damage related to both ischemia and reperfusion. This chapter reviews the mechanisms involved in ROS generation, the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, the current strategies to treat ischemic stroke and new possible therapeutic strategies to treat this disease. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.', ""TITLE: Young Adults Rehabilitation Needs and Experiences following Stroke (YARNS): A review of digital accounts to inform the development of age-appropriate support and rehabilitation | KEYWORDS: media; nurses; patient perspectives; qualitative approaches; quality of care; rehabilitation; service-user perspectives; social media; stroke; support | ABSTRACT: Aims: To explore younger adults' experiences of stroke rehabilitation to inform practice, education and future health policy. Design: Qualitative analysis of digital and other media sources on public platforms. Methods: Between March and June 2020, the experiences of younger adult stroke survivors aged 18 to 45 at the time of the stroke were collected. Data were gathered from publicly available sources, including social media, and from English-speaking users. In total, 117 accounts from 103 participants were identified from films, autobiographical books, blogs, websites, videos, Twitter and Instagram. Data analysis followed narrative and multimodal analysis with a focus on rehabilitation needs. Results: Younger adult stroke survivors make sense of their experience by reflecting on how stroke has impacted their lives. Accounts reflected an emotional journey between the past self, the present self and evolving self, as well as associated challenges such as the impact on relationships and careers. The majority of accounts presented transitions as problematic, including the receipt of the initial diagnosis, or sometimes misdiagnosis, to returning home and achieving long-term rehabilitation goals. Specialist stroke nurses were considered essential in the rehabilitation process. Conclusion: A complex process of recovery follows stroke for younger adult stroke populations. Challenges to the rehabilitation process need to be better understood and the role of nursing highlighted in future service provision. A series of age-related challenges were highlighted that require attention to improve the care and support offered. Impact: This article informs clinicians, educators, and policymakers of the age-related needs of young adult stroke survivors. Focusing on the individual and the development of age-appropriate person-centred stroke care is important. The study highlights the role of stroke nursing and challenges the current policy focus on older stroke populations as well as arguing for greater awareness of age-appropriate stroke rehabilitation in younger adults following stroke.""]"

Our goal in this work is to examine the influence of several bridging functional groups between the BODIPY and oxasmaragdyrin systems forming dyads (D), as potential components of DSSC, on the aromatic, photophysical, and charge transport properties. A set of 11 dyads made of the oxasmaragdyrin with 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl and methylamine groups in two of their meso carbons (S) and the 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY, B) moieties that differ in the binding bridge between them has been analyzed with density functional theory (DFT). The geometries were optimized with the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory employing D3 Grimme′s correction, and a set of six functionals (B3LYP, BHandHLYP, CAM-B3LYP, PBE0, wB97X, TPSSh) was evaluated for reference systems in time-dependent DFT calculations. We found that TPSSh presents the best agreement with the available data of UV-vis spectra, so it was used for calculation of the electronic absorption spectra of the 11 oxasmaragdyrins and 11 dyads. When the bridge between S and B consists of one (D3), two (D5), or three acetylene units (D6), a strong absorption band in the infrared region around 1000 nm can be achieved. These bands correspond to charge-separated excited states that favor a panchromatic absorption in that region. The aromaticity index NICS(0) computed at the macrocycle center ring critical point using the GIAO/B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory shows in all these systems an aromatic character for the oxasmaragdyrin macrocycle (from -10.7 to -12.4 ppm). We also found that all dyads present a favorable electron injection toward the semiconductor TiO2 because the LUMO energy of the dyad is higher than the conduction band of the semiconductor (-4.3 eV) used in a solar cell. Besides, the HOMO energy of the dyads D3, D5, and D6 is lower than the redox potential (-4.8 eV) of a mediator as the I-/I3 - system used to recover it after circulation of electrons. Nonequilibrium Green′s function-based calculations performed for a couple of dyads, with (D6) and without (D4) a significant charge transfer band, connected to Au electrodes show that D6 was to be a better conductor, in agreement with the charge transfer results obtained from the photophysical properties. Finally, the Gibbs free energy for the formation of the dyads here investigated is calculated. All of them are shown to be exergonic reactions (ΔGsolution < 0), which suggests that these systems could be synthesized.', 'TITLE: Halide Perovskite Thin Films for Neutron and X-Ray Detection | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The need for high-efficiency wide-area coverage radiation detectors is essential in applications related to nuclear medicine, industrial imagining, environmental monitoring, spacecraft applications, and homeland security, among others.

The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of catecholaminergic rostral ventrolateral medulla catecholaminergic neurones (RVLM-C1) to both haemodynamic and respiratory alterations in HF. Apnoea/hypopnoea incidence (AHI), breathing variability, respiratory–cardiovascular coupling, cardiac autonomic control and cardiac function were analysed in HF rats with or without selective ablation of RVLM-C1 neurones. Partial lesion (∼65%) of RVLM-C1 neurones reduces AHI, respiratory variability, and respiratory–cardiovascular coupling in HF rats. In addition, the deleterious effects of central chemoreflex activation on cardiac autonomic balance and cardiac function in HF rats was abolished by ablation of RVLM-C1 neurones. Our findings suggest that RVLM-C1 neurones play a pivotal role in breathing irregularities in volume overload HF, and mediate the sympathetic responses induced by acute central chemoreflex activation. Abstract: Rostral ventrolateral medulla catecholaminergic neurones (RVLM-C1) modulate sympathetic outflow and breathing under normal conditions. Heart failure (HF) is characterized by chronic RVLM-C1 activation, increased sympathetic activity and irregular breathing patterns. Despite studies showing a relationship between RVLM-C1 and sympathetic activity in HF, no studies have addressed a potential contribution of RVLM-C1 neurones to irregular breathing in this context. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the contribution of RVLM-C1 neurones to irregular breathing patterns in HF. Sprague–Dawley rats underwent surgery to induce volume overload HF. Anti-dopamine β-hydroxylase–saporin toxin (DβH-SAP) was used to selectively lesion RVLM-C1 neurones. At 8 weeks post-HF induction, breathing pattern, blood pressures (BP), respiratory–cardiovascular coupling (RCC), central chemoreflex function, cardiac autonomic control and cardiac function were studied. Reduction (∼65%) of RVLM-C1 neurones resulted in attenuation of irregular breathing, decreased apnoea–hypopnoea incidence (11.1 ± 2.9 vs. 6.5 ± 2.5 events h−1; HF+Veh vs. HF+DβH-SAP; P < 0.05) and improved cardiac autonomic control in HF rats. Pathological RCC was observed in HF rats (peak coherence >0.5 between breathing and cardiovascular signals) and was attenuated by DβH-SAP treatment (coherence: 0.74 ± 0.12 vs. 0.54 ± 0.10, HF+Veh vs. HF+DβH-SAP rats; P < 0.05). Central chemoreflex activation had deleterious effects on cardiac function and cardiac autonomic control in HF rats that were abolished by lesion of RVLM-C1 neurones. Our findings reveal that RVLM-C1 neurones play a major role in irregular breathing patterns observed in volume overload HF and highlight their contribution to cardiac dysautonomia and deterioration of cardiac function during chemoreflex activation.', 'TITLE: Selective carotid body ablation in experimental heart failure: A new therapeutic tool to improve cardiorespiratory control | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: New Findings: What is the topic of this review? This review summarizes the physiological role played by the carotid body in the autonomic dysregulation and breathing disturbances during the progression of chronic heart failure and the therapeutic potential of carotid body ablation to control cardiorespiratory imbalance and improve survival in heart failure. What advances does it highlight? Carotid body ablation markedly improves breathing stability and normalizes autonomic function in chronic heart failure. More importantly, if carotid body ablation is performed early during the progression of the disease it significantly improves animal survival. Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a leading medical problem worldwide. Common hallmarks of CHF include autonomic imbalance and breathing disorders, both of which are closely related to the progression of the disease and strongly predict mortality in CHF patients. The role played by the carotid body (CB) chemoreceptors in the progression of CHF has received attention because enhanced carotid chemoreflex drive is thought to contribute to autonomic dysfunction, abnormal breathing patterns and increased mortality in CHF. Therefore, therapeutic tools intended to normalize CB-mediated chemoreflex drive could have the potential to improve quality of life and decrease mortality of CHF patients. In experimental CHF, an enhancement of the CB chemoreflex drive, elevated sympathetic outflow, increased resting breathing variability, increased incidence of apnoea and desensitization of the baroreflex have been shown. Notably, selective elimination of the CB reduced central presympathetic neuronal activation, normalized sympathetic outflow and baroreflex sensitivity and stabilized breathing function in CHF. More remarkably, CB ablation has been shown to be a valuable therapeutic tool that significantly reduced aberrant cardiac remodelling, improved left ventriclular ejection fraction and reduced cardiac arrhythmogenesis. Most importantly, animals with CHF that underwent CB ablation showed a marked improvement in survival rate. Interestingly, a case report from a heart failure patient in whom unilateral CB ablation was performed showed promising results, with significant improvement in autonomic balance and breathing variability. Together, the CHF data from experimental animals as well as humans unveil a major role for the CB chemoreceptors in the progression of heart failure and support the notion that CB ablation could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce cardiorespiratory dysfunction and improve survival during heart failure.', 'TITLE: Carotid Body-Mediated Chemoreflex Drive in the Setting of low and High Output Heart Failure | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Enhanced carotid body (CB) chemoreflex function is strongly related to cardiorespiratory disorders and disease progression in heart failure (HF). The mechanisms underlying CB sensitization during HF are not fully understood, however previous work indicates blood flow per se can affect CB function. Then, we hypothesized that the CB-mediated chemoreflex drive will be enhanced only in low output HF but not in high output HF. Myocardial infarcted rats and aorto-caval fistulated rats were used as a low output HF model (MI-CHF) and as a high output HF model (AV-CHF), respectively. Blood flow supply to the CB region was decreased only in MI-CHF rats compared to Sham and AV-CHF rats. MI-CHF rats exhibited a significantly enhanced hypoxic ventilatory response compared to AV-CHF rats. However, apnea/hypopnea incidence was similarly increased in both MI-CHF and AV-CHF rats compared to control. Kruppel-like factor 2 expression, a flow sensitive transcription factor, was reduced in the CBs of MI-CHF rats but not in AV-CHF rats. Our results indicate that in the setting of HF, potentiation of the CB chemoreflex is strongly associated with a reduction in cardiac output and may not be related to other pathophysiological consequences of HF.']"

In this paper, a comprehensive state-of-the-art study of hybrid VLC/RF networks is carried out, divided into four areas. First, indoor scenarios are studied considering lighting requirements, hybrid channel models, load balancing, resource allocation, and hybrid network topologies. Second, the characteristics and implementation of these hybrid networks in outdoor scenarios with adverse conditions are analyzed. Third, we address the main applications of hybrid VLC/RF networks in technological, economic, and socio-environmental domains. Finally, we outline the main challenges and future research lines of hybrid VLC/RF networks.', 'TITLE: Network Selection in Hybrid Visible Light Communication-Radiofrequency System | KEYWORDS: Hybrid Networks; Network Selection; Radio Frequency (RF); Visible Light Communications (VLC) | ABSTRACT: Radio frequency (RF) spectrum limitations pose a major challenge to overcome to ensure the quality of service in networks beyond the fifth generation (5G).

Members of the genus Acidihalobacter are iron- and sulfur-oxidizing, halotolerant acidophiles that have developed the ability to tolerate acid and saline stress and, therefore, have the potential to bioleach ores with brackish or saline process waters under acidic conditions. The genus consists of four members, A. prosperus DSM 5130T, A. prosperus DSM 14174, A. prosperus F5 and ""A. ferrooxidans"" DSM 14175. An in depth genome comparison was undertaken in order to provide a more comprehensive description of the mechanisms of halotolerance used by the different members of this genus. Pangenome analysis identified 29, 3 and 9 protein families related to halotolerance in the core, dispensable and unique genomes, respectively. The genes for halotolerance showed Ka/Ks ratios between 0 and 0.2, confirming that they are conserved and stabilized. All the Acidihalobacter genomes contained similar genes for the synthesis and transport of ectoine, which was recently found to be the dominant osmoprotectant in A. prosperus DSM 14174 and A. prosperus DSM 5130T. Similarities also existed in genes encoding low affinity potassium pumps, however, A. prosperus DSM 14174 was also found to contain genes encoding high affinity potassium pumps. Furthermore, only A. prosperus DSM 5130T and ""A. ferrooxidans"" DSM 14175 contained genes allowing the uptake of taurine as an osmoprotectant. Variations were also seen in genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis and/or transport of periplasmic glucans, sucrose, proline, and glycine betaine. This suggests that versatility exists in the Acidihalobacter genus in terms of the mechanisms they can use for halotolerance. This information is useful for developing hypotheses for the search for life on exoplanets and moons.', 'TITLE: Genome-based classification of two halotolerant extreme acidophiles, acidihalobacter prosperus V6 (=DSM 14174 =JCM 32253) and’acidihalobacter ferrooxidans’ V8 (=DSM 14175 =JCM 32254) as two new species, acidihalobacter aeolianus sp. nov. and acidihalobacter ferrooxydans sp. nov., respectively | KEYWORDS: Acidophile; Halotolerant; Iron and sulfur oxidising | ABSTRACT: Phylogenomic analysis of recently released high-quality draft genome sequences of the halotolerant acidophiles, Acidihalobacter prosperus V6 (=DSM 14174=JCM 32253) and ‘Acidihalobacter ferrooxidans’ V8 (=DSM 14175=JCM 32254), was undertaken in order to clarify their taxonomic relationship. Sequence based phylogenomic approaches included 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, multi-gene phylogeny from the concatenated alignment of nine selected housekeeping genes and multiprotein phylogeny using clusters of orthologous groups of proteins from ribosomal protein families as well as those from complete sets of markers based on concatenated alignments of universal protein families. Non-sequence based approaches for species circumscription were based on analyses of average nucleotide identity, which was further reinforced by the correlation indices of tetra-nucleotide signatures as well as genome-to-genome distance (digital DNA–DNA hybridization) calculations. The different approaches undertaken in this study for species tree reconstruction resulted in a tree that was phylogenetically congruent, revealing that both micro-organisms are members of separate species of the genus Acidihalobacter. In accordance, it is proposed that A. prosperus V6T (=DSM 14174T=JCM 32253T) be formally classified as Acidihalobacter aeolianus sp. nov., and ‘Acidihalobacter ferrooxidans’ V8T (=DSM 14175T=JCM 32254T) as Acidihalobacter ferrooxydans sp. nov., and that both represent the type strains of their respective species.', 'TITLE: Prediction and Inferred Evolution of Acid Tolerance Genes in the Biotechnologically Important Acidihalobacter Genus | KEYWORDS: acid resistance; chloride/proton antiporters; extreme acidophile; genome evolution; phylogenomics; polyextremophile; potassium transporters; urease | ABSTRACT: Acidihalobacter is a genus of acidophilic, gram-negative bacteria known for its ability to oxidize pyrite minerals in the presence of elevated chloride ions, a capability rare in other iron-sulfur oxidizing acidophiles. Previous research involving Acidihalobacter spp. has focused on their applicability in saline biomining operations and their genetic arsenal that allows them to cope with chloride, metal and oxidative stress. However, an understanding of the molecular adaptations that enable Acidihalobacter spp. to thrive under both acid and chloride stress is needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how this genus can thrive in such extreme biomining conditions. Currently, four genomes of the Acidihalobacter genus have been sequenced: Acidihalobacter prosperus DSM 5130T, Acidihalobacter yilgarnensis DSM 105917T, Acidihalobacter aeolianus DSM 14174T, and Acidihalobacter ferrooxydans DSM 14175T. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the Acidihalobacter genus roots to the Chromatiales class consisting of mostly halophilic microorganisms. In this study, we aim to advance our knowledge of the genetic repertoire of the Acidihalobacter genus that has enabled it to cope with acidic stress. We provide evidence of gene gain events that are hypothesized to help the Acidihalobacter genus cope with acid stress. Potential acid tolerance mechanisms that were found in the Acidihalobacter genomes include multiple potassium transporters, chloride/proton antiporters, glutamate decarboxylase system, arginine decarboxylase system, urease system, slp genes, squalene synthesis, and hopanoid synthesis. Some of these genes are hypothesized to have entered the Acidihalobacter via vertical decent from an inferred non-acidophilic ancestor, however, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from other acidophilic lineages is probably responsible for the introduction of many acid resistance genes.']"

Vaccine development against this pathogen has been delayed after the detrimental effects produced in children by vaccination with a formalin-inactivated hRSV preparation (FI-hRSV), which caused enhanced disease upon natural viral infection. Since then, several studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying such disease exacerbation. Along these lines, several studies have suggested that antibodies elicited by immunization with FI-hRSV show low neutralizing capacity and promote the formation of immune complexes containing hRSV (hRSV-ICs), which contribute to hRSV pathogenesis through the engagement of Fc gamma receptors (Fc?Rs) expressed on the surface of immune cells. Furthermore, a role for Fc?Rs is supported by studies evaluating the contribution of these molecules to hRSV-induced disease. These studies have shown that Fc?Rs can modulate viral clearance by the host and the inflammatory response triggered by hRSV infection. In addition, ICs can facilitate viral entry into host cells expressing Fc?Rs, thus extending hRSV infectivity. In this article, we discuss current knowledge relative to the contribution of hRSV-ICs and Fc?Rs to the pathogenesis caused by hRSV and their putative role in the exacerbation of the disease caused by this virus after FI-hRSV vaccination. A better understanding Fc?Rs involvement in the immune response against hRSV will contribute to the development of new prophylactic or therapeutic tools to promote virus clearance with limited inflammatory damage to the airways.', 'TITLE: A safe and efficient BCG vectored vaccine to prevent the disease caused by the human Respiratory Syncytial Virus | KEYWORDS: BCG; hRSV immune response; hRSV vaccine | ABSTRACT: The human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV) causes lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Such infections also cause a large number of hospitalizations and affects mainly newborns, young children and the elderly worldwide. Symptoms associated with hRSV infection are due to an exacerbated immune response characterized by low levels of IFN-γ, recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils to the site of infection and lung damage. Although hRSV is a major health problem, no vaccines are currently available. Different immunization approaches have been developed to achieve a vaccine that activates the immune system, without triggering an unbalanced inflammation. These approaches include live attenuated vaccine, DNA or proteins technologies, and the use of vectors to express proteins of the virus. In this review, we discuss the host immune response to hRSV and the immunological mechanisms underlying an effective and safe BCG vectored vaccine against hRSV.', 'TITLE: New insights contributing to the development of effective vaccines and therapies to reduce the pathology caused by hRSV | KEYWORDS: BCG; HRSV; Prophylaxis; Respiratory viruses; Vaccine | ABSTRACT: Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV) is one of the major causes of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) worldwide, leading to significant levels of immunocompromisation as well as morbidity and mortality in infants. Its main target of infection is the ciliated epithelium of the lungs and the host immune responses elicited is ineffective at achieving viral clearance. It is thought that the lack of effective immunity against hRSV is due in part to the activity of several viral proteins that modulate the host immune response, enhancing a Th2-like pro-inflammatory state, with the secretion of cytokines that promote the infiltration of immune cells to the lungs, with consequent damage. Furthermore, the adaptive immunity triggered by hRSV infection is characterized by weak cytotoxic T cell responses and secretion of low affinity antibodies by B cells. These features of hRSV infection have meant that, to date, no effective and safe vaccines have been licensed. In this article, we will review in detail the information regarding hRSV characteristics, pathology, and host immune response, along with several prophylactic treatments and vaccine prototypes. We will also expose significant data regarding the newly developed BCG-based vaccine that promotes protective cellular and humoral response against hRSV infection, which is currently undergoing clinical evaluation.']"

In in vivo models of myocardial infarction, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation has been reported as a cardioprotector; however, it remains unknown whether TLR4 activation can prevent CF death triggered by simulated I/R (sI/R). In this study, we analyzed TLR4 activation in neonate CFs exposed to an in vitro model of sI/R and explored the participation of the pro-survival kinases Akt and ERK1/2. Simulated ischemia was performed in a free oxygen chamber in an ischemic medium, whereas reperfusion was carried out in normal culture conditions. Cell viability was analyzed by trypan blue exclusion and the MTT assay. Necrotic and apoptotic cell populations were evaluated by flow cytometry. Protein levels of phosphorylated forms of Akt and ERK1/2 were analyzed by Western blot. We showed that sI/R triggers CF death by necrosis and apoptosis. In CFs exposed only to simulated ischemia or only to sI/R, blockade of the TLR4 with TAK-242 further reduced cell viability and the activation of Akt and ERK1/2. Preconditioning with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or treatment with LPS in ischemia or reperfusion was not protective. However, LPS incubation during both ischemia and reperfusion periods prevented CF viability loss induced by sI/R. Furthermore, LPS treatment reduced the sub-G1 population, but not necrosis of CFs exposed to sI/R. On the other hand, the protective effects exhibited by LPS were abolished when TLR4 was blocked and Akt and ERK1/2 were inhibited. In conclusion, our results suggest that TLR4 activation protects CFs from apoptosis induced by sI/R through the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.', 'TITLE: The association of ascorbic acid, deferoxamine and N-acetylcysteine improves cardiac fibroblast viability and cellular function associated with tissue repair damaged by simulated ischemia/reperfusion | KEYWORDS: Ascorbic acid; Cardiac fibroblasts; Deferoxamine; Ischemia/reperfusion; N-acetylcysteine; Reactive oxygen species | ABSTRACT: Acute myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and thus, an extensively studied disease. Nonetheless, the effects of ischemia/reperfusion injury elicited by oxidative stress on cardiac fibroblast function associated with tissue repair are not completely understood. Ascorbic acid, deferoxamine, and N-acetylcysteine (A/D/N) are antioxidants with known cardioprotective effects, but the potential beneficial effects of combining these antioxidants in the tissue repair properties of cardiac fibroblasts remain unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether the pharmacological association of these antioxidants, at low concentrations, could confer protection to cardiac fibroblasts against simulated ischemia/reperfusion injury. To test this, neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts were subjected to simulated ischemia/reperfusion in the presence or absence of A/D/N treatment added at the beginning of simulated reperfusion. Cell viability was assessed using trypan blue staining, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed using a 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate probe. Cell death was measured by flow cytometry using propidium iodide. Cell signaling mechanisms, differentiation into myofibroblasts and pro-collagen I production were determined by Western blot, whereas migration was evaluated using the wound healing assay. Our results show that A/D/N association using a low concentration of each antioxidant increased cardiac fibroblast viability, but that their separate administration did not provide protection. In addition, A/D/N association attenuated oxidative stress triggered by simulated ischemia/reperfusion, induced phosphorylation of pro-survival extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and PKB (protein kinase B)/Akt, and decreased phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic proteins p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK). Moreover, treatment with A/D/N also reduced reperfusion-induced apoptosis, evidenced by a decrease in the sub-G1 population, lower fragmentation of pro-caspases 9 and 3, as well as increased B-cell lymphoma-extra large protein (Bcl-xL)/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) ratio.

A target laminar coflow non-premixed ethylene flame was used as reference flame. Experimental evaluation of soot optical properties was carried out by measurements of two color absorption/emission signals, whereas detailed numerical simulations accounted for hydrogen tracking on the soot surface, allowing to define a H/C ratio that can be interpreted as representative of soot maturity. Results present an overall reduction on soot content and local flame emission with the H2 addition, while the opposite trend is encountered with the increase of OI. Changes are more pronounced close to the reaction zone near the flame edge, rather than the flame center. Under constant heat release rate conditions, temperature is mainly affected by the change of O2, whereas the addition of H2 results in a slight temperature variation. Both species intensify the combustion reactions, increasing the reaction rates and reducing the flame length. This effect is more noticeable for increasing the OI, than for the H2 addition for the cases studied. Carbon-to-soot conversion efficiency is reduced by H2 addition, as the soot oxidation processes become more predominant over soot formation processes, which are also affected by the change of temperature conditions. At 40% H2 addition, the carbon-to-soot efficiency remains approximately constant with the addition of O2. Overall, these trends are well-captured by the numerical simulations, although they underestimate soot volume fraction, specially for high OIs and near the flame wing. Finally, experimental results indicate that H2 prompts the soot maturation process, being more pronounced above 20% H2 addition, for high O2 contents, specially near the flame centerline.', 'TITLE: Revealing soot maturity based on multi-wavelength absorption/emission measurements in laminar axisymmetric coflow ethylene diffusion flames | KEYWORDS: Absorption function; LOSA; Pyrometry; Soot maturity | ABSTRACT: A novel diagnostic is proposed to characterize the maturity of soot particles in a laminar axisymmetric coflow ethylene diffusion flame in terms of the spectral dependence of soot absorption function. The method relies on the combination of line-of-sight attenuation (LOSA) and emission measurements at four wavelengths (500, 532, 660 and 810 nm). The analysis of the measured signals enables the determination of soot temperature, soot volume fraction, soot maturity and the contribution of soot scattering to extinction. The analysis of extinction and emission measurements considers the spatial variation of soot optical properties. The introduction of a maturity index allows the evaluation of soot maturity based on the spectral variation of the soot absorption function. The maturity index is correlated with the organic or the mature soot content and finally in terms of the absolute value of absorption function at 810 nm. The methodology is validated using a set of synthetic spectral LOSA and emission signals representing experimental measurements based on numerical results obtained using the CoFlame code. A sensitivity analysis of the Abel inversion is also performed to properly address the effect of deconvolution procedure. Finally, the proposed method is applied to analyze the experimental data of spectrally-resolved LOSA and emission acquired in a laminar axisymmetric coflow ethylene diffusion flame established on a Gülder burner. The two-dimensional distributions of soot temperature, soot volume fraction, soot maturity, and the ratio of total scattering to absorption are determined. Mature soot particles are found on the top of the flame in the centerline region and also in the outer edge of the flame wing displaying strong gradients.', 'TITLE: Soot Pyrometry by Emission Measurements at Different Wavelengths in Laminar Axisymmetric Flames | KEYWORDS: coflow flame; error analysis; self-absorption; soot temperature; Three-color pyrometry | ABSTRACT: In this work, a multi-wavelength pyrometry method is proposed in order to evaluate soot temperature for laminar axisymmetric non-premixed flames. A single radiative model that combines three detection wavelengths is developed to increase the spectral information used in the soot temperature determination. A simple set-up is used in order to capture the soot emission at two or three wavelengths. The robustness of the methodology is assessed by a radiative model, which includes a sensitivity and relative error analysis for the soot temperature, and accounts for self-absorption effects. The model and procedure are verified by employing numerical temperature and soot volume fraction fields to recreate the convoluted soot emissions. Soot emission measurements involve different combinations of wavelengths that are employed to evaluate soot temperature without requiring additional measurements of the soot absorption coefficient when soot self-absorption is neglected. The error on the determined soot temperature was estimated to be lower than 60 K under this assumption for soot volume fractions under 10 ppm. In addition, an analysis of the signal noise effect on the temperature shows that the modulated absorption/emission (MAE) technique is more sensitive than the emission (EMI) technique. A sensitivity analysis showed that the presented three-wavelength EMI model is less sensitive to small deviations on the measured soot emission ratio than the classical two-wavelength approach. This feature makes the model suitable to improve the accuracy on the determination of soot temperature when the noise level of the signal is significant.']"

We previously reported that endotoxins induce the conversion of ECs into activated fibroblasts. Through endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis, ECs change their morphology and their protein expression pattern, thereby suppressing endothelial markers and upregulating fibrotic proteins. The most commonly used fibrotic inducers are transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and TGF-β2. However, whether TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 participate in endotoxin- induced endothelial fibrosis remains unknown. We have shown that the endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis process is dependent on the TGF-β receptor, ALK5, and the activation of Smad3, a protein that is activated by ALK5 activation, thus suggesting that endotoxin elicits TGF-β production to mediate endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis. Therefore, we investigated the dependence of endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis on the expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. Endotoxin-treated ECs induced the expression and secretion of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 downregulation inhibited the endotoxininduced changes in the endothelial marker VE-cadherin and in the fibrotic proteins α-SMA and fibronectin. Thus, endotoxin induces the production of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 as a mechanism to promote endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that endotoxin induces endothelial fibrosis via TGF-β secretion, which represents an emerging source of vascular dysfunction. These findings contribute to understanding the molecular mechanism of endotoxin- induced endothelial fibrosis, which could be useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.', 'TITLE: Endotoxin induces fibrosis in vascular endothelial cells through a mechanism dependent on transient receptor protein melastatin 7 activity | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory diseases, including endotoxemia-derived sepsis syndrome, is characterized by endothelial dysfunction. It has been demonstrated that the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces the conversion of endothelial cells (ECs) into activated fibroblasts through endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition mechanism. Fibrogenesis is highly dependent on intracellular Ca2+ concentration increases through the participation of calcium channels. However, the specific molecular identity of the calcium channel that mediates the Ca2+ influx during endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis is still unknown. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a calcium channel that is expressed in many cell types, including ECs. TRPM7 is involved in a number of crucial processes such as the conversion of fibroblasts into activated fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts, being responsible for the development of several characteristics of them. However, the role of the TRPM7 ion channel in endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis is unknown. Thus, our aim was to study whether the TRPM7 calcium channel participates in endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis. Using primary cultures of ECs, we demonstrated that TRPM7 is a crucial protein involved in endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis. Suppression of TRPM7 expression protected ECs from the fibrogenic process stimulated by endotoxin. Downregulation of TRPM7 prevented the endotoxin-induced endothelial markers decrease and fibrotic genes increase in ECs. In addition, TRPM7 downregulation abolished the endotoxin-induced increase in ECM proteins in ECs. Furthermore, we showed that intracellular Ca2+ levels were greatly increased upon LPS challenge in a mechanism dependent on TRPM7 expression. These results demonstrate that TRPM7 is a key protein involved in the mechanism underlying endotoxin-induced endothelial fibrosis. © 2014 Echeverría et al.', 'TITLE: Lipopolysaccharide induces a fibrotic-like phenotype in endothelial cells | KEYWORDS: Endothelial dysfunction; Fibrosis; Inflammation; Lipopolysaccharide | ABSTRACT: Endothelial dysfunction is crucial in endotoxaemia-derived sepsis syndrome pathogenesis. It is well accepted that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces endothelial dysfunction through immune system activation. However, LPS can also directly generate actions in endothelial cells (ECs) in the absence of participation by immune cells. Although interactions between LPS and ECs evoke endothelial death, a significant portion of ECs are resistant to LPS challenge. However, the mechanism that confers endothelial resistance to LPS is not known. LPS-resistant ECs exhibit a fibroblast-like morphology, suggesting that these ECs enter a fibrotic programme in response to LPS. Thus, our aim was to investigate whether LPS is able to induce endothelial fibrosis in the absence of immune cells and explore the underlying mechanism. Using primary cultures of ECs and culturing intact blood vessels, we demonstrated that LPS is a crucial factor to induce endothelial fibrosis. We demonstrated that LPS was able and sufficient to promote endothelial fibrosis, in the absence of immune cells through an activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) activity-dependent mechanism. LPS-challenged ECs showed an up-regulation of both fibroblast-specific protein expression and extracellular matrix proteins secretion, as well as a down-regulation of endothelial markers. These results demonstrate that LPS is a crucial factor in inducing endothelial fibrosis in the absence of immune cells through an ALK5-dependent mechanism. It is noteworthy that LPS-induced endothelial fibrosis perpetuates endothelial dysfunction as a maladaptive process rather than a survival mechanism for protection against LPS. These findings are useful in improving current treatment against endotoxaemia-derived sepsis syndrome and other inflammatory diseases. © 2013 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine Published by Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']"

Several factors influence whether or not people decide to be vaccinated. Some studies suggest that our perception of what significant others do and think influences our behavior.

Although the microwave (38 GHz) eight-step FZP lens is certainly inferior, the corresponding terahertz (1.5 THz) FZP lens is comparable in focusing action to the ordinary one. By use of a new design approach to the terahertz FZP lens/antenna the typical unwanted focusing shift from the design frequency is removed and even better focusing performance is obtained within a limited frequency band.

It is contrasted to a plane Fresnel zone (PFZ) lens, a CFZ lens of conical rings and a refractive plane-hyperbolic (PH) lens. For the same aperture diameter of about 25 mm and focal length of 30 mm, a 229-GHz CFZ lens of flat rings with a 30-degree opening semi-angle significantly surpasses the PFZ and PH lenses in focusing gain and efficiency. Also, it exhibits a subwavelength transverse resolution and much higher axial resolution. The cited 30-degree flat-ring CFZ lens has 4.5 times smaller weight than the PH lens, and is easy to manufacture as a plane multilayer package by means of precise machining or modern photolithographic and other microelectronic technologies. Nevertheless, the CFZ lens benefits over the corresponding PH refractive lens are attained on account of smaller frequency bandwidth and bigger lens thickness.

The major toxins involved in diseases are alpha (CPA), beta (CPB), epsilon (ETX), iota (ITX), enterotoxin (CPE), and necrotic B-like (NetB) toxins. CPA is the main virulence factor involved in gas gangrene in humans, whereas its role in animal diseases is limited and controversial. CPB is responsible for necrotizing enteritis and enterotoxemia, mostly in neonatal individuals of many animal species, including humans. ETX is the main toxin involved in enterotoxemia of sheep and goats. ITX has been implicated in cases of enteritis in rabbits and other animal species; however, its specific role in causing disease has not been proved. CPE is responsible for human food-poisoning and non-foodborne C. perfringens-mediated diarrhea. NetB is the cause of necrotic enteritis in chickens. In most cases, host–toxin interaction starts on the plasma membrane of target cells via specific receptors, resulting in the activation of intracellular pathways with a variety of effects, commonly including cell death. In general, the molecular mechanisms of cell death associated with C. perfringens toxins involve features of apoptosis, necrosis and/or necroptosis.', 'TITLE: Comparative pathogenesis of enteric clostridial infections in humans and animals | KEYWORDS: Animals; Clostridial; Clostridium spp.; Humans; Pathogenesis | ABSTRACT: Several enteric clostridial diseases can affect humans and animals. Of these, the enteric infections caused by Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile are amongst the most prevalent and they are reviewed here. C. perfringens type A strains encoding alpha toxin (CPA) are frequently associated with enteric disease of many animal mammalian species, but their role in these diseased mammals remains to be clarified. C. perfringens type B encoding CPA, beta (CPB) and epsilon (ETX) toxins causes necro-hemorrhagic enteritis, mostly in sheep, and these strains have been recently suggested to be involved in multiple sclerosis in humans, although evidence of this involvement is lacking. C. perfringens type C strains encode CPA and CPB and cause necrotizing enteritis in humans and animals, while CPA and ETX producing type D strains of C. perfringens produce enterotoxemia in sheep, goats and cattle, but are not known to cause spontaneous disease in humans. The role of C. perfringens type E in animal or human disease remains poorly defined. The newly revised toxinotype F encodes CPA and enterotoxin (CPE), the latter being responsible for food poisoning in humans, and the less prevalent antibiotic associated and sporadic diarrhea. The role of these strains in animal disease has not been fully described and remains controversial. Another newly created toxinotype, G, encodes CPA and necrotic enteritis toxin B-like (NetB), and is responsible for avian necrotic enteritis, but has not been associated with human disease. C. difficile produces colitis and/or enterocolitis in humans and multiple animal species. The main virulence factors of this microorganism are toxins A, B and an ADP-ribosyltransferase (CDT). Other clostridia causing enteric diseases in humans and/or animals are Clostridium spiroforme, Clostridium piliforme, Clostridium colinum, Clostridium sordellii, Clostridium chauvoei, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium neonatale. The zoonotic transmission of some, but not all these clostridsial species, has been demonstrated.', 'TITLE: NanI Sialidase Enhances the Action of Clostridium perfringens Enterotoxin in the Presence of Mucus | KEYWORDS: Clostridium perfringens; Enterotoxin; Mucus; NanI sialidase | ABSTRACT: Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) is the main virulence factor for C. perfringens type F strains to cause human gastrointestinal diseases, which can involve lethal enterotoxemia. During type F disease, CPE encounters an adherent mucus layer overlying the intestines, so the current study evaluated if NanI potentiates CPE activity in the presence of adherent mucus. CPE alone caused more cytotoxicity transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability to fluorescent dextran (FD) for minimal mucus-producing HT29 cells versus that in their derivative HT29-MTX-E12 cells, which produce abundant adherent mucus. However, for HT29-MTX-E12 cells, the presence of NanI significantly increased CPE binding and pore formation, which enhanced their sensitivity to CPE effects on cytotoxicity, TEER, and FD permeability. When the ability of NanI to potentiate CPE-induced enterotoxemia was then tested in a mouse small intestinal loop enterotoxemia model, a pathophysiologically relevant 50 mg/mL dose of CPE did not kill mice. However, the copresence of purified NanI resulted in significant CPE-induced lethality. More CPE was detected in the sera of mice challenged with 50 mg/mL of CPE when NanI was copresent during challenge. The copresence of NanI and CPE during challenge also significantly increased intestinal histologic damage compared to that after challenge with CPE alone, suggesting that NanI enhancement of CPE-induced intestinal damage may increase CPE absorption into blood. Overall, these results indicate that (i) mucus inhibits CPE action and (ii) NanI can potentiate CPE action in the presence of mucus, which may help explain why type F strains that produce relatively low levels of CPE are still pathogenic. IMPORTANCE NanI is a sialidase produced by some Clostridium perfringens type F strains. Here, we found that NanI can significantly increase the action of C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), which is the main toxin responsible for severe human enteric disease caused by type F strains. This effect likely helps to explain why even some type F strains that produce small amounts of CPE are pathogenic.']"

Cortisol performs its effects through the modulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), activating gene expression. Until now the contribution of both receptors in the global transcriptional response in teleost skeletal muscle has not been explored. To understand in a comprehensive and global manner how GR and MR modulates the skeletal muscle transcriptomic response, we performed RNA-seq analysis. Juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) pretreated with a suppressor of endogenous cortisol production were intraperitoneally injected with cortisol (10 mg/kg). We also included a treatment with mifepristone (GR antagonist) and eplerenone (MR antagonist) in the presence or absence of cortisol. cDNA libraries were constructed from the skeletal muscle of rainbow trout groups: vehicle, cortisol, mifepristone, eplerenone, mifepristone/cortisol and eplerenone/cortisol. RNA-seq analysis revealed that 135 transcripts were differentially expressed in cortisol vs. mifepristone/cortisol group, mainly associated to inflammatory response, ion transmembrane transport, and proteolysis. In the other hand, 68 transcripts were differentially expressed in cortisol vs. eplerenone/cortisol group, mainly associated to muscle contraction, and regulation of cell cycle. To validate these observations, we performed in vitro experiments using rainbow trout myotubes. In myotubes treated with cortisol, we found increased expression of cxcr2, c3, and clca3p mediated by GR, associated with inflammatory response, proteolysis, and ion transmembrane transport, respectively. Contrastingly, MR modulated the expression of myh2 and gadd45g mainly associated with muscle contraction and regulation of cell cycle, respectively. These results suggest that GR and MR have a differential participation in the physiological response to stress in teleost skeletal muscle.', 'TITLE: Quantitative proteomics analysis of membrane glucocorticoid receptor activation in rainbow trout skeletal muscle | KEYWORDS: Cortisol; Myotube; Nongenomic; Skeletal muscle; Stress; Teleost | ABSTRACT: Cortisol modulates energy metabolism promoting the mobilization of glucose and increasing proteolysis to overcome stressful situations in teleost. The cortisol metabolic effects are attributed to genomic mechanisms that involve the interaction of cortisol with its glucocorticoid intracellular receptor. Furthermore, cortisol can also interact with plasma membrane glucocorticoid receptors activating a rapid nongenomic signaling; however, its contribution during the early acute phase stress response in fish is unknown. In the present work, we evaluated the effects of membrane-initiated cortisol actions in vivo in the proteome of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) skeletal muscle. Quantitative iTRAQ analyses were performed to examine proteomic changes in rainbow trout stimulated with physiological concentrations of cortisol and cortisol-BSA, a membrane-impermeable cortisol conjugate. A total of 873 proteins were identified, among which 61 and 47 proteins were differentially expressed under cortisol and cortisol-BSA treatments, respectively. Functional clustering analysis revealed an upregulation of proteins associated with mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation. These results were validated by Western blot analysis. Additionally, using rainbow trout myotubes, the participation of membrane glucocorticoid receptors in gene expression was evaluated. The results obtained suggest that cortisol acts through a membrane canonical glucocorticoid receptor and mediates the expression of proteins associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.', 'TITLE: Early regulation of corticosteroid receptor expression in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) gills is mediated by membrane-initiated cortisol signaling | KEYWORDS: Cortisol; Gills; Glucocorticoid receptor; Mineralocorticoid receptor; Rainbow trout; RT-gills-W1 | ABSTRACT: Cortisol is a key stress-related hormone involved in the physiological adjustments of fish. In gills, cortisol contributes to acclimatization to changes in environmental salinity, promoting both ion uptake or salt excretion. Cortisol exerts its biological effects through its interaction with specific intracellular glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors. Additionally, the further identification of GR and MR on the surface of different tissues, together with the existence of cortisol-mediated effects observed using membrane-impermeable analogs (e.g., cortisol-BSA), supports the existence of membrane-initiated cortisol actions in fish. Nevertheless, the impact of this alternative cortisol mechanism in relevant tissues for fish salinity acclimation, such as gill, is unknown. In this work, we sought to explore the contribution of rapid membrane-initiated cortisol on GR and MR regulation in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) gills using in vivo and in vitro approaches. Juvenile rainbow trout intraperitoneally injected with cortisol or cortisol-BSA showed increased gr2 but no gr1 or mr mRNA levels in gills after one hour of treatment. This result was further confirmed using RT-gills-W1 cell lines stimulated with both versions of cortisol. Interestingly, after three and six hours of cortisol or cortisol-BSA treatment, there were no changes in the mRNA levels of any corticosteroid receptor in RT-gills-W1 cells. Finally, using immunofluorescence analysis, we identified GR and MR in rainbow trout gill cells localized on the cell surface. Considering the in vivo and in vitro results of this work, we suggest that membrane-initiated cortisol action contributes to the early expression of gr2 in rainbow trout gills during salinity acclimation.']"

However, prior descriptive work has shown that teacher-child emotion talk in preschool classrooms is scarce. As children are spending increasing amounts of time in preschool programs, there is value in understanding the factors associated with teacher-child emotion talk for supporting these types of interactions. In this study, child and teacher factors associated with teacher-child emotion talk frequency were examined. Participants included 183 preschool teachers and 470 children rated by their teachers as displaying elevated externalizing behaviors in a mix of federally funded (Head Start), state funded, and private preschool programs within two eastern states in the United States. Emotion talk frequency was observed in the context of a standardized, dyadic teacher-child storybook reading task. Results from a multilevel model showed that emotion talk frequency was primarily explained by differences between teachers. Particularly, teachers talked with children about emotions more often when they (1) held an early childhood major and (2) were observed to engage in more responsive teaching. Policy or Practice: Results identify malleable teacher factors linked to teacher-child emotion talk frequency. Findings also highlight the role of preschool teachers as socializers of young children’s emotions and suggest the need for future research to understand how the quality of emotion talk varies between and within teachers.', 'TITLE: Understanding Banking Time Implementation in a Sample of Preschool Children Who Display Early Disruptive Behaviors | KEYWORDS: Disruptive behaviors; Early intervention; Implementation science; Preschool; Teacher–child interactions; Teacher–child relationships | ABSTRACT: The development of a warm and supportive relationship with their teacher is protective for preschool children, and particularly beneficial for children who display early disruptive behaviors. Banking Time is a dyadic, short-term intervention to improve the quality of teacher–child interactions between a teacher and a specific child, building a more positive teacher–child relationship. During Banking Time sessions, both teacher and child interact toward an activity chosen by the child. This study used variable- and person-centered approaches to examine Banking Time implementation in a sample of diverse preschool teachers (N = 120) and children (N = 319) randomly selected to participate in the intervention. Results indicated that the majority of teachers implemented expected practices (i.e., observe and narrate the child’s actions, allow the child to lead) as intended. However, although teachers were instructed to limit teacher-directed practices (i.e., ask questions, give praise, and use commands), teachers’ use of these practices was not as limited as ideally expected. Three different implementation patterns were evident: (1) High Fidelity, in which the teachers engaged in the child’s activity while ensuring that the child led the session; (2) Low Engaged, in which the child led the session, but the teacher was not engaged in the child’s activity; and (3) Teacher-Led, in which the teacher was engaged in the child’s activity but also directing the session instead of ensuring the child’s lead. These implementation patterns were linked to changes in the quality of teacher–child interactions. Implementation findings from this study can inform interventions to improve the quality of teacher–child interactions.', 'TITLE: Preschool Children’s Observed Interactions with Teachers: Implications for Understanding Teacher–Child Relationships | KEYWORDS: Gender; Preschool; Race/ethnicity; Teacher–child interactions; Teacher–child racial/ethnic match; Teacher–child relationships | ABSTRACT: Theory and research point to the daily interactions between individual children and teachers as formative to teacher–child relationships, yet observed dyadic teacher–child interactions in preschool classrooms have largely been overlooked. This study provides a descriptive examination of the quality of individual children’s interactions with their teacher as a basis for understanding one source of information theorized to inform children’s and teachers’ perceptions of their relationships with each other. Children’s dyadic interactions with teacher, including their positive engagement, communication, and conflict, were observed across a large and racially/ethnically diverse sample of 767 preschool children (M = 4.39 years) at three time points in the year. On average, most children displayed low-to-moderate levels of positive engagement (78%), while nearly all children showed rare communication (81%) and conflict (99%) with the teacher. Boys demonstrated lower positive engagement and higher conflict with the teacher than girls. Black children were observed to demonstrate higher positive engagement with the teacher compared to White children. No differences in interaction quality were observed for Black children with a White teacher compared to White child-White teacher or Black child-Black teacher pairs. Results advance our understanding of dyadic teacher–child interactions in preschool classrooms and raise new questions to expand our knowledge of how teacher–child relationships are established, maintained, and modified, to ultimately support teachers in building strong relationships with each and every preschooler.']"

In the controller-to-plant link, we cope with data losses by considering a networked predictive control strategy in which the controller not only sends the current control inputs to the actuators, but also sequences of predicted control inputs at every time step. These are stored in buffers located at the corresponding actuator side, with the aim of being used in case of data loss. Additionally, for losses occurring in the plant-to-controller link, we assume that the controller contains a data-dropout compensation mechanism capable of replacing the missing measurements with their optimal estimates. It is assumed that acknowledgment packages are sent from the plant to the controller, to indicate if the previous sequence was received or not. For this setup, we compute optimal time-varying estimates of the plant and buffer state, and for the lost measurements as well. Finally, we provide the optimal stationary estimator, which serves as a simpler alternative to the time-varying one.', 'TITLE: Lp stability of networked control systems implemented on WirelessHART | KEYWORDS: Lpstability; Networked control; Non-linear systems; WirelessHART | ABSTRACT: This paper provides results on input–output Lp stability of networked control systems (NCSs) implemented over WirelessHART (WH). WH is a communication protocol widely used in process instrumentation. It is mainly characterised by its multi-hop structure, slotted communication cycles, and the possibility to simultaneously transmit over different frequencies. We propose a non-linear hybrid model of WH–NCSs that is able to capture these network functionalities, and that it is more general than existing models in the literature. Particularly, the multi-hop nature of the network is translated into an interesting mathematical structure in our model. We then follow the emulation approach to stabilise the NCS. We first assume that we know a stabilising controller for the plant without the network. We subsequently show that, under reasonable assumptions on the scheduling protocol, stability is preserved when the controller is implemented over the network with sufficiently frequent data transmission. Specifically, we provide bounds on the maximum allowable transmission interval (MATI) under which all protocols that satisfy the property of being persistently exciting (PE) lead to Lp stable WH–NCSs. These bounds exploit the mathematical structure of our WH–NCS model, improving the existing bounds in the literature. Additionally, we explain how to schedule transmissions over the hops to satisfy the PE property. In particular, we show how simultaneous transmissions over different frequency channels can be exploited to further enlarge the MATI bound.', 'TITLE: Observer design for networked control systems implemented over WirelessHART | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: We study the design of state observers for nonlinear networked control systems (NCSs) that are implemented over WirelessHART (WH).

The transcription factor LRH-1/NR5A2 is critical to intestinal cortisol production (intestinal steroidogenesis), being reduced in UC patients. However, the relationship between LRH-1 expression and distribution with altered corticosteroid responses is unknown. To address this, we categorized UC patients by their steroid response. Here, we found that steroid-dependent and refractory patients presented reduced glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated intestinal steroidogenesis compared to healthy individuals and responder patients, possibly related to increased colonic mucosa GR isoform beta (GRβ) content and cytoplasmic LRH-1 levels in epithelial and lamina propria cells. Interestingly, an intestinal epithelium-specific GR-induced knockout (GRiKO) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis mice model presented decreased epithelial LRH-1 expression, whilst it increased in the lamina propria compared to DSS-treated control mice.

The transcription factor LRH-1/NR5A2 is critical to intestinal cortisol production (intestinal steroidogenesis), being reduced in UC patients. However, the relationship between LRH-1 expression and distribution with altered corticosteroid responses is unknown. To address this, we categorized UC patients by their steroid response. Here, we found that steroid-dependent and refractory patients presented reduced glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated intestinal steroidogenesis compared to healthy individuals and responder patients, possibly related to increased colonic mucosa GR isoform beta (GRβ) content and cytoplasmic LRH-1 levels in epithelial and lamina propria cells. Interestingly, an intestinal epithelium-specific GR-induced knockout (GRiKO) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-colitis mice model presented decreased epithelial LRH-1 expression, whilst it increased in the lamina propria compared to DSS-treated control mice.

Cells expressing IL-22 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), transcription factor master switch gene implicated in the differentiation and function of Th22 lymphocytes, have been detected in periodontal tissues of periodontitis-affected patients. In addition, IL-22 has been associated with osteoclast differentiation and their bone resorptive activity in vitro. However, the destructive potential of IL-22–expressing AhR+ Th22 lymphocytes over periodontal tissues during periodontitis has not been demonstrated in vivo yet. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze whether IL-22–expressing CD4+AhR+ T lymphocytes detected in periodontal lesions are associated with alveolar bone resorption during experimental periodontitis. Material and Methods: Using a murine model of periodontitis, the expression levels of IL-22 and AhR, as well as the Th1-, Th2-, Th17- and T regulatory-associated cytokines, were analyzed in periodontal lesions using qPCR. The detection of CD4+IL-22+AhR+ T lymphocytes was analyzed in periodontal lesions and cervical lymph nodes that drain these periodontal lesions using flow cytometry. In addition, the expression of the osteoclastogenic mediator called receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) was analyzed by qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Finally, alveolar bone resorption was analyzed using micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy, and the bone resorption levels were correlated with IL-22 and RANKL expression. Results: Higher levels of IL-22, AhR, and RANKL, as well as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, and TNF-α, were expressed in periodontal lesions of infected mice compared with periodontal tissues of sham-infected and non-infected controls. Similarly, high RANKL immunoreaction was observed in periodontal tissues of infected mice; however, few or absent RANKL immunoreaction was observed in controls. This association between RANKL and periodontal infection was ratified by western blot. Furthermore, a higher detection of CD4+IL-22+AhR+ T lymphocytes was found in periodontal lesions and cervical lymph nodes that drain these periodontal lesions in infected mice compared with non-infected controls. Finally, the increased IL-22 and RANKL expression showed positive correlation between them and with the augmented alveolar bone resorption observed in experimental periodontal lesions.

Based on the anti-genicity of the O-polysaccharide component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS), different A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes have been described.

Methods: For periodontal lesion induction, mice were orally infected with the different A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes or their purified LPS. Alveolar bone resorption was analyzed using microcomputed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. Bacterial infection, receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) and Th1 and Th17-associated cytokine, CC-chemokine, and CC-chemokine receptor levels were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).

Results: In periodontal lesions, serotype b of A. actinomycetemcomitans induced higher alveolar bone resorption and expression of RANKL compared with the other serotypes. In addition, serotype b induced greater levels of Th1-and Th17-related cytokines, CC-chemokines, and CC-chemokine receptors than the others.

Heat waves, extreme temperatures, and unpredictable weather patterns have become more frequent in wine-growing regions, creating an uncertain future for growers. In response, shading nets have emerged as a promising and adaptable technology to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on grape production and wine quality. By moderating the vine microclimate, shading nets reduce solar radiation, decrease the extreme heat and wind speed, and improve water-use efficiency, enhancing ripening dynamics and preserving berry quality. However, the effectiveness of shading nets varies depending on the shade provided and the specific characteristics of the nets, highlighting the importance of adjusting the strategies to the specific needs of each environment, productive system, and grape variety. This review explores the influence of shading nets on grapevine physiological responses, including their ability to enhance resilience to stress. It examines their impact on grape and wine quality, providing insights into this vital adaptive tool for the future of viticulture.', 'TITLE: Could 101-14 Mgt Rootstock Affect Post-Spring Frost Vine Developing? Preliminary Findings | KEYWORDS: cold; grape; spring frost; vine; viticulture | ABSTRACT: (1) Background: Spring frost damage is a common phenomenon that occurs in Southern Chile that considerably affects vine productivity and grape quality. (2) Methods: A field trial was conducted in order to study vine phenology and berry physicochemical parameters in Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir ungrafted and grafted (onto 101-14 Mgt rootstock) grapevines after a spring frost. This event killed the totality of primary bud shoots when the vines reached the phenological stage of unfolded leaves. (3) Results: From budburst, to flowering of secondary bud shoots, ungrafted Sauvignon Blanc grapevines presented an advanced phenology, whereas 101-14 Mgt rootstock tended to advance the maturity of Pinot Noir grapevines from flowering to ripening of berries. At harvest, berries from secondary buds of vines grafted onto 101-14 Mgt rootstock showed higher soluble solids than the ones from ungrafted Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc vines. High total phenolic content was found in berries from secondary buds of the grafted vines, compared to the ones from the ungrafted vines. Berry soluble solids variability tended to statistically decrease toward harvest in the studied plant materials, and the maximum coefficient of variation for soluble solids, berry weight, berry firmness and berry size reached 9.5%, 25.9%, 18.6% and 8.9%, respectively.

Global warming is altering traditional viticulture zones, prompting the exploration of new regions for grape cultivation, the selection of climate-resilient cultivars, and the implementation of adaptive practices. This review synthesizes recent advances in adaptive viticulture practices and plant growth regulator applications, highlighting novel molecular and physiological insights on cold stress resilience and berry quality. Key strategies include delayed winter pruning to mitigate frost damage, osmoprotectant application to improve freeze tolerance, and canopy management techniques (cluster thinning and defoliation) to enhance berry ripening and wine composition. Their effectiveness depends on vineyard microclimate, soil properties and variety-specific physiological response. Cover cropping is examined for its role in vine vigor regulation, improving soil microbial diversity, and water retention, though its effectiveness depends on soil type, participation patterns, and vineyard management practices. Recent transcriptomic and metabolomic studies have provided new regulatory mechanisms in cold stress adaptation, highlighting the regulatory roles of abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, ethylene, and salicylic acid in dormancy induction, oxidative stress response, and osmotic regulation. Reflective mulch technologies are currently examined for their ability to enhance light interception, modulating secondary metabolite accumulation, improving technological maturity (soluble solids, pH, and titratable acidity) and enhancing phenolic compounds content. The effectiveness of these strategies remains highly site-specific, influenced by variety selection and pruning methods particularly due to their differences on sugar accumulation and berry weight. Future research should prioritize long-term vineyard trials to refine these adaptive strategies, integrate genetic and transcriptomic insights into breeding programs to improve cold hardiness, and develop precision viticulture tools tailored to cold climate vineyard management.']"

This study investigated the efficiency of shortterm vertical plyometric training program within soccer practice to improve both explosive actions and endurance in young soccer players. Seventy-six players were recruited and assigned either to a training group (TG; n = 38; 13.2 ± 1.8 years) or a control group (CG; n = 38; 13.2 ± 1.8 years) group. All players trained twice per week, but the TG followed a 7-week plyometric program implemented within soccer practice, whereas the CG followed regular practice. Twenty-meter sprint time (20-m), Illinois agility test time, countermovement jump (CMJ) height, 20- (RSI20) and 40- (RSI40) cm drop jump reactive strength index, multiple 5 bounds distance (MB5), maximal kicking test for distance (MKD), and 2.4-km time trial were measured before and after the 7-week period. Plyometric training induced significant (p ≤ 0.05) and small to moderate standardized effect (SE) improvement in the CMJ (4.3%; SE = 0.20), RSI20 (22%; SE = 0.57), RSI40 (16%; SE = 0.37), MB5 (4.1%; SE = 0.28), Illinois agility test time (23.5%, SE = 20.26), MKD (14%; SE = 0.53), 2.4-km time trial (21.9%; SE = 20.27) performances but had a trivial and nonsignificant effect on 20-m sprint time (20.4%; SE = 20.03).

The plyometric training program was applied during 6 weeks, 2 sessions per week, with a load from 140 to 260 jumps per session, replacing some soccer-specific drills. After intervention, the CG did not show significant performance changes. PT24 and PT48 groups showed a small-to-moderate significant improvement in all performance tests (p < 0.001), with no differences between treatments. Although it has been recommended that plyometric drills should not be conducted on consecutive days, the study shows that plyometric training applied twice weekly on consecutive or nonconsecutive days results in similar explosive and endurance adaptations in young male soccer players.']"

The measurement is performed in final states containing one electron and missing transverse momentum using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb−1. Differential cross sections for events with at least one or two jets are presented for a range of observables, including jet transverse momenta and rapidities, the scalar sum of transverse momenta of the visible particles and the missing transverse momentum in the event, and the transverse momentum of the W boson. For a subset of the observables, the differential cross sections of positively and negatively charged W bosons are measured separately. In the cross-section ratio of W+/W− the dominant systematic uncertainties cancel out, improving the measurement precision by up to a factor of nine. The observables and ratios selected for this paper provide valuable input for the up quark, down quark, and gluon parton distribution functions of the proton.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].', 'TITLE: Measurement of the inclusive cross-section for the production of jets in association with a Z boson in proton–proton collisions at 8 TeV using the ATLAS detector | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The inclusive cross-section for jet production in association with a Z boson decaying into an electron–positron pair is measured as a function of the transverse momentum and the absolute rapidity of jets using 19.9 fb- 1 of s=8 TeV proton–proton collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.

It examines the dynamics associated with employer PC Fulfillment (PCF) to the team and compares them to the dynamics regarding employer PCF of the individual’s own psychological contract. Guided by psychological contracts and self-regulation theories, we surveyed 504 individuals in 69 retail organization teams at two time periods. At the team level, findings support an indirect effect of team PCF on both team engagement and average turnover intention through affective climate. Similarly, at the individual level, we find an indirect effect of individual PCF on both engagement and turnover intentions through individual affect. Tests of scalar and configural similarity across levels support functional isomorphism between individual and team PCF relationships with engagement, while turnover intention is more highly related to individual than to team PCF. Last, we observe cross-level effects of team PCF on the relationship between individual PCF and turnover intentions. We present implications for multi-level PC theory, research, and practice.', 'TITLE: Well-being in work teams | KEYWORDS: Affective convergence; Social contagion; Team emergent states; Team leadership; Team well-being; Teamwork; Virtual teams; Work teams | ABSTRACT: Organisational structures increasingly favour team-based work. As a result, understanding the determinants of work team well-being is pivotal. This entry reviews key constructs, theories, and influential factors underpinning team well-being, distinguishing between cognitive and affective dimensions. Definitions often treat team well-being as an aggregate of individual well-being, but the emergence of team-level well-being as a shared experience is important. Theoretical frameworks, such as social identity and social contagion theories, provide explanations for affective convergence within teams. Notably, leadership emerges as a critical factor affecting team well-being. The consequences of team well-being span from team processes to broader organisational metrics. Future research directions encompass refining construct definitions, exploring temporal dynamics, understanding the unique challenges of virtual teams, and developing targeted interventions to enhance team well-being.', 'TITLE: Emergence in Context: How Team-Client Psychological Contract Fulfillment Is Associated With the Emergence of Team Identification or Team-Member Exchange | KEYWORDS: emergence; multilevel modeling; team identification; team-client psychological contract fulfillment; team-member exchange | ABSTRACT: Psychological contracts have been theorized to occur at different levels of analysis and with different exchange parties. In this article, we develop the concept of team-client psychological contract fulfillment (team-client PCF) as a team-level social exchange indicator, reflecting the team members’ perceptions of the degree of fulfillment of the commitments a client promised to a team. Using the multilevel group-process framework (Lang et al., 2019) and a sample of newly formed self-managed teams consisting of 838 observations, nested in 244 individuals, 56 teams, and in four waves of data, we tested the claim that team-client PCF may determine the type of collective states that emerge within the team. When team-client PCF is higher, it should create conditions for the emergence of team states related to team maintenance (i.e., team identification), whereas when team-client PCF is lower, it is more likely that teams develop states related to the regulation of team performance (i.e., team-member exchange [TMX]). Our results support our hypotheses. We discuss implications for both the psychological contract literature as well as the team dynamics literature (especially team dynamics of team identification and TMX).']"

This approach, which offers both an alternative formulation of general relativity itself, as well as modifications thereof, is appealing under several aspects. Teleparallel gravity theories can be understood as gauge theories of the translation group, whose Lagrangian is of first derivative order in the fundamental fields, and thus has more in common with the Yang-Mills Lagrangian known from particle physics. Further, they offer a rich phenomenology, giving rise to numerous viable candidate theories addressing the open questions in cosmology. This chapter gives an introduction to the foundations of teleparallel gravity, an overview of modified teleparallel theories, and a summary of the phenomenology of various such theories in cosmology and beyond.', 'TITLE: Noether symmetry approach in f(T, B) teleparallel cosmology | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: We consider the cosmology derived from f(T, B) gravity where T is the torsion scalar and B=2e∂μ(eTμ) a boundary term.

We adopt the Noether Symmetry Approach to study the related dynamical systems and to find cosmological solutions.', 'TITLE: Teleparallel gravity: from theory to cosmology | KEYWORDS: astrophysics; observational cosmology; teleparallel gravity | ABSTRACT: Teleparallel gravity (TG) has significantly increased in popularity in recent decades, bringing attention to Einstein’s other theory of gravity. In this Review, we give a comprehensive introduction to how teleparallel geometry is developed as a gauge theory of translations together with all the other properties of gauge field theory. This relates the geometry to the broader metric-affine approach to forming gravitational theories where we describe a systematic way of constructing consistent teleparallel theories that respect certain physical conditions such as local Lorentz invariance. We first use TG to formulate a teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (GR) which is dynamically equivalent to GR but which may have different behaviors for other scenarios, such as quantum gravity. After setting this foundation, we describe the plethora of modified teleparallel theories of gravity that have been proposed in the literature. We attempt to connect them together into general classes of covariant gravitational theories. Of particular interest, we highlight the recent proposal of a teleparallel analogue of Horndeski gravity which offers the possibility of reviving all of the regular Horndeski contributions. In the second part of the Review, we first survey works in teleparallel astrophysics literature where we focus on the open questions in this regime of physics. We then discuss the cosmological consequences for the various formulations of TG. We do this at background level by exploring works using various approaches ranging from dynamical systems to Noether symmetries, and more. Naturally, we then discuss perturbation theory, firstly by giving a concise approach in which this can be applied in TG theories and then apply it to a number of important theories in the literature. Finally, we examine works in observational and precision cosmology across the plethora of proposal theories. This is done using some of the latest observations and is used to tackle cosmological tensions which may be alleviated in teleparallel cosmology. We also introduce a number of recent works in the application of machine learning to gravity, we do this through deep learning and Gaussian processes, together with discussions about other approaches in the literature.']"

Considering the increase in food imports into Chile, a personal survey was carried out of 400 mapuche and 400 non mapuche persons to determine the importance of the country of origin in the purchase decision for beef in people of different ethnic groups in the La Araucanía and Metropolitan Regions (Chile). Conjoint analysis revealed that country of origin was slightly less important than price (44.4% and 55.6%), with no signifcant differences by ethnic group, but a possible regional ethno-centrist effect was detected. Using analysis of hierarchical conglomerates, two principal consumer profles were distinguished: the majority group (62.5%) assigned greater importance to the price, while the second group (28.1%) assigned greater importance to the origin. The segments presented differences by region of residence, socio-economic group and person who purchases the food. Thus from the results of this research it may be concluded that the importance of the country of origin as an attribute in the purchase decision process for beef is not associated with the ethnic origin of the consumer, considering the principal indigenous people in Chile, the Mapuche, but it is associated with the region of residence.', 'TITLE: “Country of origin” effect and ethnocentrism in food purchase in Southern Chile Efecto “país de origen” y etnocentrismo en la compra de alimentos en el sur de Chile | KEYWORDS: Chile; Ethnocentrism; Food consumption; Market segments; Origin | ABSTRACT: This study sought to determine the relative importance of the country of origin in the selection of four foodstuffs (rice, sugar, chicken meat and oil); to identify consumer segments; and to evaluate which sociodemographic variables affect ethnocentrism in food consumption, through a survey responded by 800 habitual supermarket shoppers in southern Chile.

The presence of inhibitory α1 glycine receptor (GlyRs) subunits, sensitive to ethanol, has been recently reported in accumbal neurons suggesting that they are protective against excessive binge consumption. In the present study, we used viral vectors (AAV) to overexpress mutant and WT α1 subunits in accumbal neurons in D1 Cre and α1 KI mice. Injection of a Cre-inducible AAV carrying an ethanol insensitive α1 subunit in D1 Cre neurons was unable to affect sensitivity to ethanol in GlyRs or affect ethanol drinking. On the other hand, using an AAV that transduced WT α1 GlyRs in GABAergic neurons in the nAc of high-ethanol consuming mice caused a reduction in ethanol intake as reflected by lowered drinking in the dark and reduced blood ethanol concentration. As expected, the AAV increased the glycine current density by 5-fold without changing the expression of GABAA receptors. Examination of the ethanol sensitivity in isolated accumbal neurons indicated that the GlyRs phenotype changed from an ethanol resistant to an ethanol sensitive type. These results support the conclusion that increased inhibition in the nAc can control excessive ethanol consumption and that selective targeting of GlyRs by pharmacotherapy might provide a mechanistic procedure to reduce ethanol binge.', ""TITLE: Changes in ethanol effects in knock-in mice expressing ethanol insensitive alpha1 and alpha2 glycine receptor subunits | KEYWORDS: Alcohol use disorder; Ethanol; Glycine receptor; Nucleus accumbens; Reward system | ABSTRACT: Aims: Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are potentiated by physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol, and mutations in the intracellular loop of α1 and α2 subunits reduced the effect of the drug.

We also examined ethanol-induced behavior using open field, loss of the righting response, and drinking in the dark (DID) paradigm. Key findings: Ethanol did not potentiate GlyRs nor affect neuronal excitability in the nAc from 2xKI. Moreover, ethanol decreased the Ca2+ signal in WT mice, whereas there were no changes in the signal in 2xKI mice. Interestingly, there was an increase in c-Fos baseline in the 2xKI mice in the absence of ethanol.

Sixty participants (30 females) performed an extended version of the IGT (500 trials divided into 20 blocks). We randomly assigned them to either an experimental group (Humor Group; Hg; n = 30), where humorous videos were interspersed in the decision-making trials or a control group (Non-Humor Group; NHg; n = 30), where nonhumorous videos were interspersed in the decision-making trials. We recorded participant performance and feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3b event-related potentials (ERP) during IGT feedback as task monitoring and attention allocation indicators, respectively. We expected that whereas humor would improve IGT decision-making under risk in females during the last blocks (17–20) as well as cognitive control (specifically attention allocation and task monitoring) across the entire IGT, it would impair them in males. Contrary to our expectations, humor improved IGT decision-making under risk for both sexes (specifically at blocks 19 and 20) and attention allocation for most IGT blocks (P3b amplitudes). However, humor impaired IGT decision-making under ambiguity in males during the block six and task monitoring (FRN amplitudes) for most IGT blocks.

We estimated individual ancestry proportions in a sample of 7,342 subjects ascertained in five countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, México and Perú). These individuals were also characterized for a range of physical appearance traits and for self-perception of ancestry. The geographic distribution of admixture proportions in this sample reveals extensive population structure, illustrating the continuing impact of demographic history on the genetic diversity of Latin America. Significant ancestry effects were detected for most phenotypes studied. However, ancestry generally explains only a modest proportion of total phenotypic variation. Genetically estimated and self-perceived ancestry correlate significantly, but certain physical attributes have a strong impact on self-perception and bias self-perception of ancestry relative to genetically estimated ancestry.', 'TITLE: Latin Americans show wide-spread Converso ancestry and imprint of local Native ancestry on physical appearance | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Historical records and genetic analyses indicate that Latin Americans trace their ancestry mainly to the intermixing (admixture) of Native Americans, Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans.

We find that Native American ancestry components in Latin Americans correspond geographically to the present-day genetic structure of Native groups, and that sources of non-Native ancestry, and admixture timings, match documented migratory flows. We also detect South/East Mediterranean ancestry across Latin America, probably stemming mostly from the clandestine colonial migration of Christian converts of non-European origin (Conversos). Furthermore, we find that ancestry related to highland (Central Andean) versus lowland (Mapuche) Natives is associated with variation in facial features, particularly nose morphology, and detect significant differences in allele frequencies between these groups at loci previously associated with nose morphology in this sample.', 'TITLE: Variation in dental morphology and inference of continental ancestry in admixed Latin Americans | KEYWORDS: admixture; ancestry inference; dental morphology; Latin America | ABSTRACT: Objectives: To investigate the variation in dental nonmetric traits and to evaluate the utility of this variation for inferring genetic ancestry proportions in a sample of admixed Latin Americans. Materials and Methods: We characterized a sample from Colombia (N = 477) for 34 dental traits and obtained estimates of individual Native American, European, and African ancestry using genome-wide SNP data. We tested for correlation between dental traits, genetic ancestry, age, and sex. We carried out a biodistance analysis between the Colombian sample and reference continental population samples using the mean measure of divergence statistic calculated from dental trait frequencies. We evaluated the inference of genetic ancestry from dental traits using a regression approach (with 10-fold cross-validation) as well as by testing the correlation between estimates of ancestry obtained from genetic and dental data. Results: Latin Americans show intermediate dental trait frequencies when compared to Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans. Significant correlations were observed for several dental traits, genetic ancestry, age, and sex. The biodistance analysis displayed a closer relationship of Colombians to Europeans than to Native Americans and Africans. Mean ancestry estimates obtained from the dental data are similar to the genetic estimates (Native American: 32% vs. 28%, European: 59% vs. 63%, and African: 9% vs. 9%, respectively). However, dental features provided low predictive power for genetic ancestry of individuals in both approaches tested (R 2 < 5% for all genetic ancestries across methods). Discussion: The frequency of dental traits in Latin Americans reflects their admixed Native American, European and African ancestry and can provide reasonable average estimates of genetic ancestry. However, the accuracy of individual genetic ancestry estimates is relatively low, probably influenced by the continental differentiation of dental traits, their genetic architecture, and the distribution of genetic ancestry in the individuals examined.']"

All the experimental data validate the hypothesis that kaolinite covers molybdenite, reducing its flotation recovery. The depressing effect of kaolinite on molybdenite flotation in seawater is enhanced by the magnesium and calcium hydroxo complexes at pH > 9, which induce heterocoagulation between kaolinite and molybdenite, thus reducing recovery. The attachment of the positively charged hydroxo complexes of magnesium and calcium to the molybdenite and kaolinite surfaces is diminished by SHMP. This reagent increases the repulsive forces between molybdenite and precipitates and as a result, molybdenite becomes more hydrophobic and recovery increases.']"

Isotope mixing models show that the primary prey consumed by SASL were demersal and benthopelagic fishes. Individuals sampled in summer and in the outer coast had higher δ15N values than those from winter or from the inner coast due to consumption of high trophic level demersal fish. We also found evidence of an ontogenetic shift in isotopic niche width as measured by δ13C and δ15N standard ellipse areas, with juveniles showing a restricted isotopic niche width (1.0‰2) in comparison to subadult (2.2‰2) and adult males (1.9‰2). The proportion of salmonids in the diet of the SASL was negligible and lower than reported in previous studies, which may be related to a recent drop in the production of salmon aquaculture in the region. Our study suggests that the SASL are able to adapt to shifts in spatiotemporal variations in the abundance of potential prey, including feral and farmed salmonids.']"

The role of mental simulation in desire and food choices | KEYWORDS: Desire; Grounded cognition; Healthy choice; Imagery; Implicit motivation; Mental simulation; Visual attention | ABSTRACT: Many times, desire possesses us and impedes us from making healthier food choices. From a grounded cognition perspective, we investigated the role of two types of mental simulation (process and outcome) in desire and food choice to understand the processes that modulate them and find strategies that encourage healthier food choices. In addition to these explicit measures, we used two implicit methods to measure approach-avoidance tendencies and visual attention. Our results showed that imagining the consumption of vice and virtue foods increased desire for the product imagined and seemed to favor the choice of a vice food. However, at an implicit level, the motivation to approach and avoid food products was neutral. Imagining the post-consumption of a vice food decreased desire for the imagined food and although it tempted people at an implicit level, it made people more prone to choose a virtue food. When a vice food was imagined, attentional bias increased for all types of food regardless of the simulation. When a virtue food was imagined, there was no effect on choice, motivation nor attentional bias. In conclusion, simply imagining certain foods is a potential solution for promoting healthier and thoughtful choices.']"

The results showed that the inclusion of gallic acid to chitosan films caused moderate decrease in water vapor permeability (by 29 %) and increased tensile strength of films (by 169 %) in comparison to the neat chitosan films. Furthermore, it was found that the addition of chitin nanofibers up to 30 % into chitosan/gallic acid films additionally improved tensile strength (by 474 %) and reduced plasticity of films (by 171 %), when compared to the chitosan/gallic acid films. Increased concentration of chitin nanofibers in films reduced the overall water vapor permeability of films by 51 %. In addition, gallic acid and chitin nanofibers had synergic effect on high chitosan film's antioxidant and antifungal activity toward Botrytis cinerea (both above 95 %). Finally, chitosan/gallic acid/chitin nanofibers films reduced decay incidence of strawberries, increased total soluble solid content, and promoted high production of some polyphenols during cold storage, in comparison to the control chitosan films and uncoated strawberry samples.

In this paper, we summarize the protocol of the COVID-19 HEalth caRe wOrkErS (HEROES) study, an ongoing, global initiative, aimed to describe and track longitudinal trajectories of mental health symptoms and disorders among health care workers at different phases of the pandemic across a wide range of countries in Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle-East, and Asia. Methods: Participants from various settings, including primary care clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, and mental health facilities, are being enrolled. In 26 countries, we are using a similar study design with harmonized measures to capture data on COVID-19 related exposures and variables of interest during two years of follow-up. Exposures include potential stressors related to working in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as sociodemographic and clinical factors. Primary outcomes of interest include mental health variables such as psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorders. Other domains of interest include potentially mediating or moderating influences such as workplace conditions, trust in the government, and the country’s income level. Results: As of August 2021, ~ 34,000 health workers have been recruited. A general characterization of the recruited samples by sociodemographic and workplace variables is presented. Most participating countries have identified several health facilities where they can identify denominators and attain acceptable response rates. Of the 26 countries, 22 are collecting data and 2 plan to start shortly. Conclusions: This is one of the most extensive global studies on the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, including a variety of countries with diverse economic realities and different levels of severity of pandemic and management. Moreover, unlike most previous studies, we included workers (clinical and non-clinical staff) in a wide range of settings.', 'TITLE: The Association Between Exposure to COVID-19 and Mental Health Outcomes Among Healthcare Workers | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; depression; healthcare workers (HCWs); mental health; personal protective equipment (PPE); posttraumatic stress; psychological distress | ABSTRACT: Due to the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care systems, there has been great interest in the mental wellbeing of healthcare workers. While most studies investigated mental health outcomes among frontline vs. non-frontline healthcare workers, little is known about the impact of various work-related variables. The present study aimed to examine the association between work-related [i.e., having contact with COVID-19 patients, being redeployed due to the pandemic and availability of sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE)] and subjective (i.e., worries about getting infected or infecting others) exposures and self-reported mental health outcomes (i.e., psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress symptoms). Between February and May 2021, 994 healthcare workers employed at a variety of healthcare settings in the Netherlands filled out an online survey as part of the COVID-19 HEalth caRe wOrkErS (HEROES) study. Mental health outcomes were measured using the General Health Questionnaire-12, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5. Approximately 13% reported depressive symptoms, 37% experienced psychological distress, and 20% reported posttraumatic stress symptoms. Multilevel linear models consisted of three levels: individual (work-related and subjective exposures), healthcare center (aggregated redeployment and availability of sufficient PPE), and regional (cumulative COVID-19 infection and death rates). Worries about infection were associated with all three mental health outcomes, whereas insufficient PPE was associated with psychological distress and depressive symptoms. There were no differences in outcomes between healthcare centers or provinces with different COVID-19 infection and death rates. Our findings highlight the importance of adequate PPE provision and the subjective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors should be part of interventions aimed at mitigating adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.', ""TITLE: Inequality on the frontline: A multi-country study on gender differences in mental health among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; cross-country; gender differences; healthcare disparities; healthcare workers; mental health | ABSTRACT: Healthcare workers (HCWs) were at increased risk for mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, with prior data suggesting women may be particularly vulnerable. Our global mental health study aimed to examine factors associated with gender differences in psychological distress and depressive symptoms among HCWs during COVID-19. Across 22 countries in South America, Europe, Asia and Africa, 32,410 HCWs participated in the COVID-19 HEalth caRe wOrkErS (HEROES) study between March 2020 and February 2021. They completed the General Health Questionnaire-12, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and questions about pandemic-relevant exposures. Consistently across countries, women reported elevated mental health problems compared to men. Women also reported increased COVID-19-relevant stressors, including insufficient personal protective equipment and less support from colleagues, while men reported increased contact with COVID-19 patients. At the country level, HCWs in countries with higher gender inequality reported less mental health problems. Higher COVID-19 mortality rates were associated with increased psychological distress merely among women. Our findings suggest that among HCWs, women may have been disproportionately exposed to COVID-19-relevant stressors at the individual and country level. This highlights the importance of considering gender in emergency response efforts to safeguard women's well-being and ensure healthcare system preparedness during future public health crises.""]"

The impregnation tests were carried out in a high-pressure cell using supercritical carbon dioxide as impregnation medium at different operational conditions. These assays were implemented at pressures of 9 and 12 MPa, a constant temperature equal to 40 °C and different values of depressurization rates: 0.1, 1.0 and 10 MPa min−1. Depending on the impregnation process conditions, thymol was incorporated into the films at concentrations from 13.5 to 20.5 %w/w. FTIR analyses confirmed the presence of thymol on the surface of the films. Furthermore, the supercritical impregnation process at the conditions used in this work produced a strong modification of the thermal and mechanical properties of the PLA films. On the other hand, release kinetic assays were carried out on the all prepared films. From these experimental results, it can be observed that the highest amounts of released thymol at the slowest depressurization rate were obtained. Meanwhile, the use of a previously reported mass transfer model shows that there is no significant effect of the supercritical impregnation process on the transport properties of PLA.

Although there is plenty of literature available for inter-turn short circuit analysis in electric machines, there is a gap of knowledge to unify ISC analysis of IPMSM under the same constraints. This paper conducts ISC finite element analysis (FEA) under different operating conditions and slot/pole combinations under the same current density.

The variations of the magneto motive force (MMF) due to an ISC can lead to considerable changes in the inductances, which could lead to errors when modeling motors with ISC. A dynamic model is introduced, which uses rotor reference frame variables and parameters as inputs. Saturation is included by incorporating a look-up table, thus accounting for the MMF variations due to an ISC.

Based on this model, an observer is formed for ISC diagnostics and torque compensation. The IPMSM model under ISC is presented as the model of a healthy machine, but with a disturbance given by the ratio between shorted and total turns times the current flowing in the failure path. The disturbance, defined as the fault index current (FIC), is estimated using an observer. The method is tested in Matlab/Simulink and corroborated with finite element analysis (FEA). The proposed technique provides the ability to identify the FIC for early ISC diagnostics.

Geochemical studies of magnetite from IOA deposits have provided key insights into the ore-forming processes and source of mineralizing fluids. However, to date, only qualitative estimations have been obtained for one of the key controlling physico-chemical parameters, i.e., the temperature of magnetite formation. Here we reconstruct the thermal evolution of Andean IOA deposits by using magnetite thermometry. Our study comprised a > 3000 point geochemical dataset of magnetite from several IOA deposits within the Early Cretaceous Chilean Iron Belt, as well as from the Pliocene El Laco IOA deposit in the Chilean Altiplano. Thermometry data reveal that the deposits formed under a wide range of temperatures, from purely magmatic (~ 1000 to 800 °C), to late magmatic or magmatic-hydrothermal (~ 800 to 600 °C), to purely hydrothermal (< 600 °C) conditions. Magnetite cooling trends are consistent with genetic models invoking a combined igneous and magmatic-hydrothermal origin that involve Fe-rich fluids sourced from intermediate silicate magmas. The data demonstrate the potential of magnetite thermometry to better constrain the thermal evolution of IOA systems worldwide, and help refine the geological models used to find new resources.', 'TITLE: A continuum from iron oxide copper-gold to iron oxide-apatite deposits: Evidence from fe and O stable isotopes and trace element chemistry of magnetite | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) and iron oxide-apatite (IOA) deposits are major sources of Fe, Cu, and Au. Magnetite is the modally dominant and commodity mineral in IOA deposits, whereas magnetite and hematite are predominant in IOCG deposits, with copper sulfides being the primary commodity minerals. It is generally accepted that IOCG deposits formed by hydrothermal processes, but there is a lack of consensus for the source of the ore fluid(s). There are multiple competing hypotheses for the formation of IOA deposits, with models that range from purely magmatic to purely hydrothermal. In the Chilean iron belt, the spatial and temporal association of IOCG and IOA deposits has led to the hypothesis that IOA and IOCG deposits are genetically connected, where S-Cu-Au-poor magnetite-dominated IOA deposits represent the stratigraphically deeper levels of S-Cu-Au-rich magnetite- and hematite-dominated IOCG deposits. Here we report minor element and Fe and O stable isotope abundances for magnetite and H stable isotope abundances for actinolite from the Candelaria IOCG deposit and Quince IOA prospect in the Chilean iron belt. Backscattered electron imaging reveals textures of igneous and magmatic-hydrothermal affinities and the exsolution of Mn-rich ilmenite from magnetite in Quince and deep levels of Candelaria (>500 m below the bottom of the open pit). Trace element concentrations in magnetite systematically increase with depth in both deposits and decrease from core to rim within magnetite grains in shallow samples from Candelaria. These results are consistent with a cooling trend for magnetite growth from deep to shallow levels in both systems. Iron isotope compositions of magnetite range from δ56Fe values of 0.11 ± 0.07 to 0.16 ± 0.05% for Quince and between 0.16 ± 0.03 and 0.42 ± 0.04% for Candelaria. Oxygen isotope compositions of magnetite range from δ18O values of 2.65 ± 0.07 to 3.33 ± 0.07% for Quince and between 1.16 ± 0.07 and 7.80 ± 0.07% for Candelaria. For cogenetic actinolite, δD values range from -41.7 ± 2.10 to -39.0 ± 2.10% for Quince and from -93.9 ± 2.10 to -54.0 ± 2.10% for Candelaria, and δ18O values range between 5.89 ± 0.23 and 6.02 ± 0.235 for Quince and between 7.50 ± 0.23 and 7.69 ± 0.235 for Candelaria. The paired Fe and O isotope compositions of magnetite and the H isotope signature of actinolite fingerprint a magmatic source reservoir for ore fluids at Candelaria and Quince. Temperature estimates from O isotope thermometry and Fe# of actinolite (Fe# = [molar Fe]/ ([molar Fe] + [molar Mg])) are consistent with high-temperature mineralization (600°-860°C). The reintegrated composition of primary Ti-rich magnetite is consistent with igneous magnetite and supports magmatic conditions for the formation of magnetite in the Quince prospect and the deep portion of the Candelaria deposit. The trace element variations and zonation in magnetite from shallower levels of Candelaria are consistent with magnetite growth from a cooling magmatic-hydrothermal fluid. The combined chemical and textural data are consistent with a combined igneous and magmatic-hydrothermal origin for Quince and Candelaria, where the deeper portion of Candelaria corresponds to a transitional phase between the shallower IOCG deposit and a deeper IOA system analogous to the Quince IOA prospect, providing evidence for a continuum between both deposit types.', 'TITLE: A review of magnetite geochemistry of Chilean iron oxide-apatite (IOA) deposits and its implications for ore-forming processes | KEYWORDS: Chile; IOA genetic models; Iron oxide-apatite deposits; Magnetite geochemistry; Magnetite textures | ABSTRACT: Magnetite is the most important iron ore in iron oxide-apatite (IOA) deposits which represent the Cu-poor end-member of the iron oxide-copper–gold (IOCG) clan. Magnetite chemistry has been used as a petrogenetic indicator to identify the geological environment of ore formation and as a fingerprint of the source reservoir of iron. In this study, we present new textural and microanalytical EPMA and LA-ICP-MS data of magnetite from Carmen, Fresia, Mariela and El Romeral IOA deposits located in the Cretaceous Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile. We also provide a comprehensive summary and discussion of magnetite geochemistry from Andean IOAs including Los Colorados, Cerro Negro Norte, El Romeral (Chilean Iron Belt) and the Pliocene El Laco IOA deposit located in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Chilean Andes. Microtextures coupled with geochemical data were used to define and characterize the occurrence of different magnetite types. Magnetite exhibits a variety of textural features including oscillatory zoning, colloform banding, re-equilibration textures, exsolution lamellae and symplectites. The magmatic vs. hydrothermal origin of the different magnetite types and the evolution of IOA deposits can be assessed using diagrams based on compatible trace elements. However, magnetite is very susceptible to hydrothermal alteration and to both textural and compositional re-equilibration during magmatic and superimposed hydrothermal events. Based on the data presented here, we conclude that V and Ga are possibly the most reliable compatible elements in magnetite to trace ore-forming processes in the Andean IOA deposits. Magnetite chemistry reveals different conditions/events of formation for each IOA deposit ranging from high-temperature, low-oxygen fugacity (ƒO2), purely magmatic (>600 °C) conditions; to lower temperature and higher ƒO2 magmatic-hydrothermal (300–600 °C) to low-temperature hydrothermal (<200–300 °C) conditions. Specifically, a continuous transition from high-temperature, low- ƒO2 conditions in the deepest portions of the deposits to low-temperature, relatively higher ƒO2 conditions towards surface are described for magnetite from El Laco. The new and compiled magnetite data from IOA deposits from the Chilean Iron Belt and El Laco are consistent with a transition from magmatic to hydrothermal conditions. The flotation model plausibly explains such features, which result from the crystallization of magnetite microlites from a silicate melt, nucleation and coalescence of aqueous fluid bubbles on magnetite surfaces, followed by ascent of a fluid-magnetite suspension along reactivated transtensional faults or through fissures formed during the collapse of the volcanic structure (El Laco). The decompression of the coalesced fluid-magnetite aggregates during ascent promotes the continued growth of magnetite microlites from the Fe-rich magmatic-hydrothermal fluid. As with any general genetic model, the flotation model allows variation and the definition of different styles or subtypes of IOA mineralization. The deeper, intrusive-like Los Colorados deposit shows contrasting features when compared with the Cerro Negro Norte hydrothermal type, the pegmatitic apatite-rich deposits of Carmen, Fresia and Mariela, and the shallow, subaerial deposits of El Laco. These apparent differences depend fundamentally on the depth of formation, the presence of structures and faults that trigger decompression, the composition of the host rocks, and the source and flux rate of hydrothermal fluids.']"

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been used as treatment of ligament desmopathy. However, there is scarce in vitro information about the mechanism of action of leukocyte rich and leukocyte poor PRP related products. The aim of this study was to compare the anti-inflammatory, anabolic and anti-catabolic effects of a leukocyte-concentrate platelet-rich gel supernatant (Lc-PRGS) and a leukocyte-re-duced PRGS (Lr-PRGS) of ligament explants (LEs) challenged with lipopolysaccha-ride (LPS). Methods. LEs from 6 horses were cultured for 72 h with Lc-PRGS and Lr-PRGS at concentrations of 25 and 50%, respectively. Hyaluronic acid (HA) was measured by ELISA on culture media of experimental groups at 1 h and 72 h. At 72 h, LEs were used either for quantitative gene expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), type 1 collagen (COL1A1), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), decorin (DCN), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) or for histology analysis. Results. All PRGS produced NFkB down-regulation. 25% Lr-PRGS produced up-regulation of COL1A1, DCN and TGF-β1. 25% Lc-PRGS induced MMP3 and MMP13 down-regulation in comparison to the rest of hemoderivatives. The general histology score was apparently better in LEs cultured with 25% Lr-PRGS. Conclusions. These findings suggest that 25% Lr-PRGS is more suitable for SL desmopathy and that possibly the up-regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) ligament anabolic genes is more important to induce SL healing than the down-regulation of ECM ligament catabolic genes. In order to determine the clinical relevance of the results found in this study, is necessary to test the effects of Lc-PRP and Lr-PRP in animal or human models. The use of Lc-PRP and Lr-PRP in desmopathy cases will be an easy-safe-low cost option for treatment.', 'TITLE: Anti-inflammatory effects of two platelet-rich gel supernatants in an in vitro system of ligament desmitis | KEYWORDS: Anti-inflammatory effect; Desmitis; Desmopathy; Platelerich plasma; Platelet-rich gel supernatants | ABSTRACT: Background. There is not even a knowledge of what is the perfect concentration of cells that should be present in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to induce an effect for treatment of desmitis. Our aims were determining the temporal effects (48 and 96 h) of leukocyte-concentrated platelet-rich gel supernatant (Lc-PRGS) and leukocyte-reduced platelet-rich gel supernatant (Lr-PRGS) of ligament explants (LEs) challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The production and degradation of growth factors, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured. Methods. LEs from horses were challenged with LPS and cultured for 96 hours with Lc-PRGS and Lr-PRGS at both 25% and 50% concentrations. Culture medium was changed every 48 h and used for determination, by ELISA, of platelet-derived growth factor isoform BB (PDGF-BB), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Results. LEs cultured with both concentrations of Lc-PRGS showed the lowest release of IL-1β in comparison with the other LE groups at 48 and 96 hours, whereas 50% Lr-PRGS induced the lowest TNF-α release from LEs at 96 hours. IL-1ra was mainly released from LEs cultured with both concentrations of Lc-PRGS at 48 and 96 hours, whereas IL-4 was mainly produced in LEs cultured with 50% Lr-PRGS at 48 and 96 hours. Conclusions. The anti-inflammatory effect of Lc-PRGS in LEs challenged with LPS seems to be related with heightened concentrations of PDGF-BB that apparently induced a higher release of IL-1ra. On the other hand, the anti-inflammatory action of Lr-PRGS could be associated with a higher release of IL-4 that may reduce the release of TNF-α). Although we observed significant correlations between some mediators evaluated in this study, these findings should be considered with caution because a correlation does not necessary mean a causal relationship. Additional in vivo studies which evaluating the effects of both Lc-PRP and Lr-PRP in either animal models or in human patients are necessary, for determination in clinical future application`s.

SLEs and TEs from six horses were independently incubated for 48 h with Lr-PRGS and Lr-PL at concentrations of 25 and 50%, respectively. Samples were collected from the incubated tissues at 1 h and 48 h, which were employed for ELISA determination of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-4, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), platelet-derived growth factor isoform BB (PDGF-BB), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1, and hyaluronic acid (HA). Overall, 50% Lr-PRGS induced significantly less IL-1β release than the other hemoderivatives in both tissues. At 48 h, both Lr-PRGS and 25% Lr-PL induced significantly higher TNF-α concentrations in SLEs when compared to TEs, whereas both Lr-PRGS concentrations induced significantly higher IL-4 concentrations in SLEs in comparison to TEs. IL-1ra release was not different between tissues. However, this cytokine was significantly higher in tissue explants cultured with both Lr-PRGS concentrations. HA concentration was lower in tissue explants cultured with all hemoderivatives at two concentrations when compared to the control group. The positive effects observed for ligaments and tendons treated with Lr-PRGS may be mediated by the inhibition of IL-1β release of and increased release of IL-4 and IL-1ra. Furthermore, PDGF-BB could be a polypeptide responsible for mediating the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines in SLEs and TEs incubated with Lr-PRGS.']"

Vaccination has been proposed as a preventive approach against STEC infection; however, there is no vaccine for humans and those used in animals reduce but do not eliminate the intestinal colonization of STEC. The OmpT, Cah and Hes proteins are widely distributed among clinical STEC strains and are recognized by serum IgG and IgA in patients with HUS. Here, we develop a vaccine formulation based on two chimeric antigens containing epitopes of OmpT, Cah and Hes proteins against STEC strains. Intramuscular and intranasal immunization of mice with these chimeric antigens elicited systemic and local long-lasting humoral responses. However, the class of antibodies generated was dependent on the adjuvant and the route of administration. Moreover, while intramuscular immunization with the combination of the chimeric antigens conferred protection against colonization by STEC O157:H7, the intranasal conferred protection against renal damage caused by STEC O91:H21.

Immunization of mice with this vaccine candidate elicited significant humoral and cellular immune responses against STEC. High levels of specific IgG antibodies were found in the serum and feces of immunized mice. However, specific IgA antibodies were not detected in either serum or feces. Furthermore, a significantly higher percentage of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells producing IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17 was observed in the spleens of immunized mice.

However, their description is essential to understand human brain dysfunction and better characterize the human brain connectome. In this work, we present a multi-subject atlas of short association fibers, which was computed using a superficial white matter bundle identification method based on fiber clustering. To create the atlas, we used probabilistic tractography from one hundred subjects from the HCP database, aligned with non-linear registration. The method starts with an intra-subject clustering of short fibers (30-85 mm). Based on a cortical atlas, the intra-subject cluster centroids from all subjects are segmented to identify the centroids connecting each region of interest (ROI) of the atlas. To reduce computational load, the centroids from each ROI group are randomly separated into ten subgroups. Then, an inter-subject hierarchical clustering is applied to each centroid subgroup, followed by a second level of clustering to select the most-reproducible clusters across subjects for each ROI group. Finally, the clusters are labeled according to the regions that they connect, and clustered to create the final bundle atlas. The resulting atlas is composed of 525 bundles of superficial short association fibers along the whole brain, with 384 bundles connecting pairs of different ROIs and 141 bundles connecting portions of the same ROI. The reproducibility of the bundles was verified using automatic segmentation on three different tractogram databases.

We performed a detailed numerical analysis by simulating hysteresis curves with an external magnetic field applied parallel to the axis of the tubes (along the z-axis). Our findings indicate that nanotubes with an external radius of 30 nm exhibit non-monotonic behavior in their coercivity due to a change in the magnetization reversal mechanism, which was not observed in nanotubes with external radii of 80 nm. Additionally, we explored the dynamic susceptibility of these nanotubes and found that the position and number of resonance peaks can be controlled by manipulating the nanotube geometry.

Expecting cross-national differences to exist, we examined if and how social mindfulness differs across countries. At little to no material cost, social mindfulness typically entails small acts of attention or kindness. Even though fairly common, such low-cost cooperation has received little empirical attention. Measuring social mindfulness across 31 samples from industrialized countries and regions (n = 8,354), we found considerable variation. Among selected country-level variables, greater social mindfulness was most strongly associated with countries' better general performance on environmental protection.

The impact of the network structure on spreading process has been widely investigated, but not the reverse question: do different processes unfolding on a given network lead to different infection patterns? How do the infection patterns depend on a model's parameters or on the nature of the contagion processes? Here we address this issue by investigating the infection patterns for a variety of models. In simple contagion processes, where contagion events involve one connection at a time, we find that the infection patterns are extremely robust across models and parameters. In complex contagion models instead, in which multiple interactions are needed for a contagion event, nontrivial dependencies on models parameters emerge, as the infection pattern depends on the interplay between pairwise and group contagions. In models involving threshold mechanisms moreover, slight parameter changes can significantly impact the spreading paths. Our results show that it is possible to study crucial features of a spread from schematized models, and inform us on the variations between spreading patterns in processes of different nature."", 'TITLE: The structure and dynamics of networks with higher order interactions | KEYWORDS: Complex networks; Emergent collective dynamics; Higher-order interactions; Hypernetworks; Processes on networked systems; Simplicial complexes; Structural properties | ABSTRACT: All beauty, richness and harmony in the emergent dynamics of a complex system largely depend on the specific way in which its elementary components interact. The last twenty-five years have seen the birth and development of the multidisciplinary field of Network Science, wherein a variety of distributed systems in physics, biology, social sciences and engineering have been modeled as networks of coupled units, in the attempt to unveil the mechanisms underneath their observed functionality. There is, however, a fundamental limit to such a representation: networks capture only pairwise interactions, whereas the functioning of many real-world systems not only involves dyadic connections, but rather is the outcome of collective actions at the level of groups of nodes. For instance, in ecological systems, three or more species may compete for food or territory, and similar multi-component interactions appear in functional and structural brain networks, protein interaction networks, semantic networks, multi-authors scientific collaborations, offline and online social networks, gene regulatory networks and spreading of consensus or contagious diseases due to multiple, simultaneous, contacts. Such multi-component interactions can only be grasped through either hypergraphs or simplicial complexes, which indeed have recently found a huge number of applications. In this report, we cover the extensive literature of the past years on this subject, and we focus on the structure and dynamics of hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. These are indeed becoming increasingly relevant, thanks to the enhanced resolution of data sets and the recent advances in data analysis techniques, which (concurrently and definitely) have shown that such structures play a pivotal role in the complex organization and functioning of real-world distributed systems.', 'TITLE: Contagion in simplicial complexes | KEYWORDS: Complex network; High-order interactions; SIS model | ABSTRACT: The propagation of information in social, biological and technological systems represents a crucial component in their dynamic behavior. When limited to pairwise interactions, a rather firm grip is available on the relevant parameters and critical transitions of these spreading processes, most notably the pandemic transition, which indicates the conditions for the spread to cover a large fraction of the network. The challenge is that, in many relevant applications, the spread is driven by higher order relationships, in which several components undergo a group interaction. To address this, we analyze the spreading dynamics in a simplicial complex environment, designed to capture the coexistence of interactions of different orders. We find that, while pairwise interactions play a key role in the initial stages of the spread, once it gains coverage, higher order simplices take over and drive the contagion dynamics. The result is a distinctive spreading phase diagram, exhibiting a discontinuous pandemic transition, and hence offering a qualitative departure from the traditional network spreading dynamics.']"

Construction of CMB lensing maps and modeling choices | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Joint analyses of cross-correlations between measurements of galaxy positions, galaxy lensing, and lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offer powerful constraints on the large-scale structure of the Universe. In a forthcoming analysis, we will present cosmological constraints from the analysis of such cross-correlations measured using Year 3 data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and CMB data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck. Here we present two key ingredients of this analysis: (1) an improved CMB lensing map in the SPT-SZ survey footprint and (2) the analysis methodology that will be used to extract cosmological information from the cross-correlation measurements. Relative to previous lensing maps made from the same CMB observations, we have implemented techniques to remove contamination from the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect, enabling the extraction of cosmological information from smaller angular scales of the cross-correlation measurements than in previous analyses with DES Year 1 data. We describe our model for the cross-correlations between these maps and DES data, and validate our modeling choices to demonstrate the robustness of our analysis. We then forecast the expected cosmological constraints from the galaxy survey-CMB lensing auto and cross-correlations. We find that the galaxy-CMB lensing and galaxy shear-CMB lensing correlations will on their own provide a constraint on S8=σ8ωm/0.3 at the few percent level, providing a powerful consistency check for the DES-only constraints. We explore scenarios where external priors on shear calibration are removed, finding that the joint analysis of CMB lensing cross-correlations can provide constraints on the shear calibration amplitude at the 5% to 10% level."", 'TITLE: Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: Cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering and weak lensing | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: We present the first cosmology results from large-scale structure using the full 5000 deg2 of imaging data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Data Release 1. We perform an analysis of large-scale structure combining three two-point correlation functions (3×2pt): (i) cosmic shear using 100 million source galaxies, (ii) galaxy clustering, and (iii) the cross-correlation of source galaxy shear with lens galaxy positions, galaxy-galaxy lensing. To achieve the cosmological precision enabled by these measurements has required updates to nearly every part of the analysis from DES Year 1, including the use of two independent galaxy clustering samples, modeling advances, and several novel improvements in the calibration of gravitational shear and photometric redshift inference. The analysis was performed under strict conditions to mitigate confirmation or observer bias; we describe specific changes made to the lens galaxy sample following unblinding of the results and tests of the robustness of our results to this decision. We model the data within the flat ΛCDM and wCDM cosmological models, marginalizing over 25 nuisance parameters. We find consistent cosmological results between the three two-point correlation functions; their combination yields clustering amplitude S8=0.776-0.017+0.017 and matter density ωm=0.339-0.031+0.032 in ΛCDM, mean with 68% confidence limits; S8=0.775-0.024+0.026, ωm=0.352-0.041+0.035, and dark energy equation-of-state parameter w=-0.98-0.20+0.32 in wCDM. These constraints correspond to an improvement in signal-to-noise of the DES Year 3 3×2pt data relative to DES Year 1 by a factor of 2.1, about 20% more than expected from the increase in observing area alone. This combination of DES data is consistent with the prediction of the model favored by the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy data, which is quantified with a probability-to-exceed p=0.13-0.48. We find better agreement between DES 3×2pt and Planck than in DES Y1, despite the significantly improved precision of both.

The high signal-to-noise of the CMB lensing cross-correlations enables several powerful consistency tests of these results, including comparisons with constraints derived from cross-correlations only, and comparisons designed to test the robustness of the galaxy lensing and clustering measurements from DES. Applying these tests to our measurements, we find no evidence of significant biases in the baseline cosmological constraints from the DES-only analyses or from the joint analyses with CMB lensing cross-correlations. However, the CMB lensing cross-correlations suggest possible problems with the correlation function measurements using alternative lens galaxy samples, in particular the redmagic galaxies and high-redshift maglim galaxies, consistent with the findings of previous studies.

Numerous studies indicate emotional regulation difficulties in both attachment avoidance and anxiety. Additionally, emotional Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), such as the Late Positive Potential (LPP), reveal the process of emotional information at the cerebral level, and thus, LPP is commonly used in studies examining emotion regulation processes. For instance, when individuals are asked to use cognitive strategies to increase, maintain, or decrease their emotional responses to stimuli, changes in LPP amplitude can reflect the effectiveness of these regulation strategies. However, little is known about the potential moderating effect of the LPP during the implementation of emotional regulation strategies in the relationship between attachment dimensions and emotional dysregulation. To address this oversight, the purpose of the present study was to examine the association between both dimensions of attachment, anxiety and avoidance, and emotional dysregulation, as well as the moderating role of the LPP during the induced implementation of cognitive reappraisal. Methods: Brain activity was recorded using EEG from n = 63 adults while they performed a task in which they were instructed to either reappraise or suppress emotions elicited by unpleasant images. To assess the associations between LPP, emotional dysregulation, and attachment orientations, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Spanish version (DERS-E) and the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire (ECR-12) were used. Results: Interestingly, we found that greater LPP amplitudes during reappraisal implementation intensified the association between attachment anxiety and emotional regulation difficulties. Conversely, this relationship was non-significant under lower levels of LPP amplitude—Providing supporting evidence for the moderating role of LPP. Discussion: Our results highlight how attachment anxiety can influence the ability to regulate emotions. This study provides new insights into how variations in LPP contribute to the effectiveness of emotion regulation strategies.', ""TITLE: Human Attachment and the Electrophysiological Dynamics of Emotion Regulation: An Event-Related Potential Study | KEYWORDS: adult attachment; cognitive reappraisal; emotion regulation; expressive suppression; late positive potential | ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation is pivotal in human interactions and well-being. Modulating one's emotional state is intricately linked with psychological, behavioral, and physiological responses. Extensive research has explored how individuals with varying attachment orientations manage emotions, predominantly through self-report measures and behavioral assessments. However, the influence of attachment orientations on temporal electrophysiological dynamics during emotion regulation tasks remains underexplored. Here, 90 adults' EEG brain activity was recorded while they engaged in tasks of attending to, reappraising, or suppressing emotions elicited by unpleasant images. Their attachment orientations were assessed using the Experiences in Close Relationships-12 (ECR-12) questionnaire to explore the association between Late Positive Potential (LPP) and attachment anxiety and avoidance amidst the deployment of emotion regulation strategies. Using Linear Mixed-Effects Model analysis, our results revealed a lower amplitude of the LPP during cognitive reappraisal, suggesting the efficacy of this strategy in diminishing emotional intensity. Moreover, higher attachment anxiety exhibited increased LPP amplitude during both Reappraisal and Suppression, as well as during the negative natural condition, indicating heightened emotional responses. This study provides novel insights into the relationship between attachment orientations and emotion regulation, as evidenced by EEG-based measurements of the LPP. The findings indicate that individuals with higher attachment anxiety display distinct electrophysiological responses, particularly in emotional scenarios."", 'TITLE: Mindfulness and emotion regulation: Insights from neurobiological, psychological, and clinical studies | KEYWORDS: Embodied cognition; Emotion dysregulation disorders; Emotion regulation; Mindfulness; Neuroimaging; Top down and bottom up processing | ABSTRACT: There is increasing interest in the beneficial clinical effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). Research has demonstrated their efficacy in a wide range of psychological conditions characterized by emotion dysregulation. Neuroimaging studies have evidenced functional and structural changes in a myriad of brain regions mainly involved in attention systems, emotion regulation, and self-referential processing. In this article we review studies on psychological and neurobiological correlates across different empirically derived models of research, including dispositional mindfulness, mindfulness induction, MBIs, and expert meditators in relation to emotion regulation. From the perspective of recent findings in the neuroscience of emotion regulation, we discuss the interplay of top-down and bottom-up emotion regulation mechanisms associated with different mindfulness models. From a phenomenological and cognitive perspective, authors have argued that mindfulness elicits a ""mindful emotion regulation"" strategy; however, from a clinical perspective, this construct has not been properly differentiated from other strategies and interventions within MBIs. In this context we propose the distinction between top-down and bottom-up mindfulness based emotion regulation strategies. Furthermore, we propose an embodied emotion regulation framework as a multilevel approach for understanding psychobiological changes due to mindfulness meditation regarding its effect on emotion regulation. Finally, based on clinical neuroscientific evidence on mindfulness, we open perspectives and dialogues regarding commonalities and differences between MBIs and other psychotherapeutic strategies for emotion regulation.']"

Among them, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) stand out as one of the most promising antimicrobial nanomaterials. Graphene oxide (GO) is another attractive nanomaterial with antimicrobial properties. Although the antimicrobial effect of AgNPs and GO is known, the development of hybrid materials of GO-AgNPs has considerable interest in various applications since they may exhibit synergistic bactericidal properties that exceed the yields of the individual components. The aims of this work were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and anti-adhesion properties of AgNPs and GO-AgNPs nanocomposites for potential applications in antimicrobial coatings. The antimicrobial activity was tested by agar diffusion method. It was found that activity varied according to the synthesis procedure of the nanomaterials. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Kokuria rhizophila were the most susceptible strains. The nanocomposite GO- AgNPs synthetized using the ex-situ method exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against all the assayed strains.

Early interventions may promote resilience and facilitate healthy development of the children through an impact on mothers' outcomes such as their sensitivity and mental health. Play with Our Children (POC) is an early intervention programme aiming to promote a positive mother-child interaction for children who attend three family health centres of deprived areas of Santiago de Chile. Objective: To estimate the effect of the programme POC on MS and mental health. Methods: A quasi-experimental design with propensity score matching estimations was employed. MS was measured with the Q-Sort of Maternal Sensitivity, and maternal mental health was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Parenting Stress Index. Mean-difference comparison and difference-in-difference method were used as statistical strategies. The sample included 102 children from 2 to 23 months of age, 54 of them participated in the intervention and 48 children were the comparison group. Results: Estimates showed that participation in POC was positively associated with less stress in mothers of children younger than 12 months (P < 0.05) and positively associated with MS for mothers of children from 12 to 23 months (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in maternal depression scores.

Here, we investigate the polarized thermal emission from X-ray dim isolated neutron stars, taking RX J1856.5-3754 as a representative case. The physical conditions of the star outermost layers in these sources is still debated, and so we consider emission from a magnetized atmosphere and a condensed surface, accounting for the effects of vacuum polarization as the radiation propagates in the star magnetosphere. We have found that, for a significant range of viewing geometries, measurement of the phase-averaged polarization fraction and phase-averaged polarization angle at both optical and X-ray wavelengths allow us to determine whether this neutron star has an atmosphere or a condensed surface. Our results may therefore be relevant in view of future developments of soft X-ray polarimeters.', 'TITLE: The X-Ray Polarimetry View of the Accreting Pulsar Cen X-3 | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The first X-ray pulsar, Cen X-3, was discovered 50 yr ago. Radiation from such objects is expected to be highly polarized due to birefringence of plasma and vacuum associated with propagation of photons in the presence of the strong magnetic field. Here we present results of the observations of Cen X-3 performed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. The source exhibited significant flux variability and was observed in two states different by a factor of ∼20 in flux. In the low-luminosity state, no significant polarization was found in either pulse phase-averaged (with a 3σ upper limit of 12%) or phase-resolved (the 3σ upper limits are 20%–30%) data. In the bright state, the polarization degree of 5.8% ± 0.3% and polarization angle of 49°. 6 ± 1°. 5 with a significance of about 20σ were measured from the spectropolarimetric analysis of the phase-averaged data. The phase-resolved analysis showed a significant anticorrelation between the flux and the polarization degree, as well as strong variations of the polarization angle. The fit with the rotating vector model indicates a position angle of the pulsar spin axis of about 49° and a magnetic obliquity of 17°. The detected relatively low polarization can be explained if the upper layers of the neutron star surface are overheated by the accreted matter and the conversion of the polarization modes occurs within the transition region between the upper hot layer and a cooler underlying atmosphere. A fraction of polarization signal can also be produced by reflection of radiation from the neutron star surface and the accretion curtain.', 'TITLE: X-ray polarimetry of X-ray pulsar X Persei: another orthogonal rotator? | KEYWORDS: magnetic fields; polarization; pulsars: individual: X Persei; stars: neutron; stars: oscillations; X-rays: binaries | ABSTRACT: X Persei is a persistent low-luminosity X-ray pulsar of period of ≈ 835 s in a Be binary system. The field strength at the neutron star surface is not known precisely, but indirect signs indicate a magnetic field above 1013 G, which makes the object one of the most magnetized known X-ray pulsars. Here we present the results of observations X Persei performed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The X-ray polarization signal was found to be strongly dependent on the spin phase of the pulsar. The energy-averaged polarization degree in 3–8 keV band varied from several to ∼20 per cent over the pulse with a phase dependence resembling the pulse profile. The polarization angle shows significant variation and makes two complete revolutions during the pulse period, resulting in nearly nil pulse-phase averaged polarization. Applying the rotating vector model to the IXPE data we obtain the estimates for the rotation axis inclination and its position angle on the sky, as well as for the magnetic obliquity. The derived inclination is close to the orbital inclination, reported earlier for X Persei. The polarimetric data imply a large angle between the rotation and magnetic dipole axes, which is similar to the result reported recently for the X-ray pulsar GRO J1008−57. After eliminating the effect of polarization angle rotation over the pulsar phase using the best-fitting rotating vector model, the strong dependence of the polarization degree with energy was discovered, with its value increasing from 0 at ∼2 keV to 30per cent at 8 keV.']"

In an attempt to mitigate this emerging infectious disease and provide candidates for marker-assisted selective breeding, we tested here the existence of a genetic component of Argopecten purpuratus scallop resistance to the pathogen Vibrio bivalvicida. Through a dual RNA-seq approach we analyzed the basal transcriptome and the transcriptional response to infection in two resistant and two susceptible families as well as the pathogen transcriptomic response to host colonization. The results highlighted a genetic basis in the resistance of scallop larvae to the pathogen. The Vibrio response was characterized by a general metabolic adaptation to the host environment, along with several predicted virulence factors overexpressed in infected scallop larvae with no difference between resistant and susceptible host phenotypes. On the host side, several biological processes were enriched in uninfected resistant larvae. Within these enriched categories, immune-related processes were overexpressed, while morphogenesis, biomineral tissue development, and angiogenesis were under expressed. Particularly, genes involved in immune recognition and antimicrobial response, such as lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins (LBPs), lysozyme, and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) were overexpressed in uninfected resistant larvae. As expected, immune-related biological processes were enriched in Vibrio-infected larvae, but they were more numerous in resistant larvae. Overexpressed immune genes in response to infection included several Toll-like receptors, TNF and NF-κB immune signaling genes, and the antimicrobial peptide Big defensin ApBD1. Results strongly suggest that both a front-loading of immune genes and an enhanced antimicrobial response to infection contribute to the resistance, while pathogen infective strategy does not discriminate between host phenotypes. Overall, early expression of host immune genes appears as a strong determinant of the disease outcome that could be used in marker-assisted selective breeding.', 'TITLE: Pathogenic impact of Vibrio spp. in scallop hemolymph: Implications for health in aquaculture | KEYWORDS: Aquaculture; Host-pathogen interactions; Scallop health; Vibrio; Virulence | ABSTRACT: The dynamics of the host-pathogen relationship are crucial for the success of marine bivalve aquaculture. Several Vibrio bacteria have been identified as pathogenic for scallops. This study covered eight months of monitoring of Vibrio spp. in the hemolymph of the scallop Argopecten purpuratus under culture conditions. Following the isolation of culturable Vibrio spp. and their taxonomic assignation, their pathogenic potential was estimated through experimental infections and cytotoxicity assays. The main findings were that: (i) scallops exhibit a low load of Vibrio spp. in the hemolymph, though these loads increase between late winter and early spring; (ii) the identified strains belong to the Splendidus, Pectenicida, and Rumoiensis clades, with the Splendidus clade being predominant, and Vibrio lentus being the most common species among them; and (iii) a high proportion of strains (86%) exhibited production of virulence factors, with four strains showing significant cytotoxic activity on scallop primary cultures of hemocytes. Two of the most virulent Vibrio isolates were confirmed as V. crassostreae HO115 and V. toranzoniae HO139 through genome sequencing. These isolates were then used for immune challenges of juvenile and adult scallops. The juvenile scallops were more affected by both vibrios compared to the adults. The juveniles showed exacerbated immune responses, a low capacity to eliminate Vibrio spp. in the hemolymph, and mortality rates of 26–40% after exposure. The most prevalent virulence-related genes in the genomes of V. crassostreae HO115 and V. toranzoniae HO139 included toxins, tissue-degrading enzymes, adhesion structures and immune evasion mechanisms.

Examples of FBVPs with both cases, interactive and non-interactive, are presented. Also from arithmetic operations for linearly correlated fuzzy numbers, we compare our solutions to the one proposed by Gasilov et al. We conclude that the fuzzy solution in the interactive case (when the boundary values are linearly correlated fuzzy numbers) is contained in the fuzzy solution for the non-interactive case.

Detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) allow for the possibility of a precise characterization of their stellar components. They offer a unique opportunity for deriving their physical parameters nearly independent of a model for a number of systems consisting of late-type giant stars. We aim to expand the sample of low-metallicity late-type giant stars with precisely determined parameters. Aims. We determine the fundamental parameters, such as the mass and radius, or the effective temperature for three long-period late-type eclipsing binaries from the Large Magellanic Cloud: OGLE-LMC-ECL-25304, OGLE-LMC-ECL-28283, and OGLE-IV LMC554.19.81. Subsequently, we determine the evolutionary stages of the systems. Methods. We fit the light curves from the OGLE project and radial velocity curves from high-resolution spectrographs using the Wilson-Devinney code.

Methods. We crossmatched the Gaia DR3 measurements (positions, velocities, atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances) with the catalog of long-period red giant candidates from the Gaia FPR, which has photometric and radial velocity variability information. Combined with the photo-geometric distances, we estimated the extinction, bolometric magnitude, luminosity, spectroscopic radius, and mass. The accuracy of this method was tested for similar samples in the literature, including red giant binaries that have asteroseismic-determined physical parameters. Results. Ellipsoidal variables are characterized as being low- to intermediate-mass stars (0:6 ≤ M1 ≤ 5:0 M⊙) with radii as large as the Roche lobe radius of the binary. Eccentricities tend to be lower for primary stars with smaller radii, which is the expected result of tidal circularization. Combined with the orbital properties, estimates for the minimum mass of the companion agree with the scenario of a low-mass compact object as the secondary star. There are at least 13 ellipsoidal binaries with orbital periods and masses of the two stars compatible with model predictions for Type Ia SN progenitors. For the rotational variables, their orbital periods, enhanced chromospheric activity, smaller radii, and low mass (M1 . 1:5 M⊙) point to a different type of binary than the original ellipsoidal sample. The Galactic velocities indicate that ellipsoidal variables are found both in the Galactic disk and halo, while rotational variables are predominantly concentrated in the Galactic disk. The velocity dispersion is much higher in the ellipsoidal than in rotational binaries, probably indicating older dynamical ages. The enhanced [α/Fe] abundances for some of the ellipsoidal binaries, havingM1 ≥ 1:0 M⊙, resemble the population of young α-rich binaries in the thick disk. An episode of mass transfer in those systems may have produced the enhanced α abundances and the enhanced [Ce/Fe] abundances reported in a few ellipsoidal binaries. Conclusions. Luminosities, radii, and masses were derived for 243 ellipsoidal and 39 rotational binary candidates, composing the largest Galactic sample of these variables with chemo-dynamical and physical parameterization. Based on their mean chemodynamical properties and stellar parameters, these binaries can be considered as two manifestations of the same phenomena, a close binary with a giant primary, instead of two independent and unrelated binary types. Detailed future analysis of individual sources will provide insights into the history and future evolution of these binaries.', 'TITLE: Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) Multiplicity properties of Oe and Be stars | KEYWORDS: binaries: close; binaries: spectroscopic; Magellanic Clouds; stars: emission-line, Be; stars: massive | ABSTRACT: Context. Rapidly rotating classical OBe stars have been proposed as the products of binary interactions, and the fraction of Be stars with compact companions implies that at least some are. However, to constrain the interaction physics spinning up the OBe stars, a large sample of homogeneously analyzed OBe stars with well-determined binary characteristics and orbital parameters are required. Aims. We investigated the multiplicity properties of a sample of 18 Oe, 62 Be, and two Of?p stars observed within the BLOeM survey in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We analyzed the first nine epochs of spectroscopic observations obtained over approximately three months in 2023. Methods. Radial velocities (RVs) of all stars were measured using cross-correlation based on different sets of absorption and emission lines. Applying commonly used binarity criteria, we classified objects as binaries, binary candidates, and apparently single (RV stable) objects. We further inspected the spectra for double-lined spectroscopic binaries and cross-matched with catalogs of X-ray sources and photometric binaries. Results. We classify 14 OBe stars as binaries, and an additional 11 as binary candidates. The two Of?p stars are apparently single. We find two more objects that are most likely currently interacting binaries. Without those, the observed binary fraction for the remaining OBe sample of 78 stars is fOBeobs = 0.18 ± 0.04 (fOBeobs+cand = 0.32±0.05 including candidates). This binary fraction is less than half of that measured for OB stars in BLOeM. Combined with the lower fraction of SB2s, this suggests that OBe stars do indeed have fundamentally different present-day binary properties than OB stars. We find no evidence for OBe binaries with massive compact companions, in contrast to expectations from binary population synthesis. Conclusions. Our results support the binary scenario as an important formation channel for OBe stars, as post-interaction binaries may have been disrupted or the stripped companions of OBe stars are harder to detect. Further observations are required to characterize the detected binaries, their orbital parameters, and the nature of their companions.']"

This has caught the attention of researchers who seek to understand the behavior of students in these courses. However, despite the efforts, approval rates remain below 5%, so more efforts are needed to understand why students end a MOOC or not. The goal of this work is to study learner's behavior in a MOOC. Specifically, it seeks to understand student interaction sequences with course resources and characterize their study sessions throughout MOOC weeks. For this, using Process Mining techniques, data from N = 38,838 learners enrolled in a MOOC in Coursera were analyzed. As a result of the analysis of learner's interactions with MOOCs, two groups of students were observed as comprehensive and strategic. In addition, differences in learning sequences were found among students from both groups who approved the MOOC. These results help advance current literature and open the debate about whether MOOCs remain open courses or a digital book."", 'TITLE: Exploring differences in how learners navigate in MOOCs based on self-regulated learning and learning styles: A process mining approach | KEYWORDS: learning styles; MOOCs; process mining; self regulation | ABSTRACT: Study in a Massive Open and Online Courses (MOOCs) is challenging, since participants take the course without the support of a teacher. Taking a MOOC require the students to have the ability to self-regulate their learning. However, every person has its own learning style and the way each one interacts and self-regulate in a MOOC varies. In this work we present an exploratory study from a process-oriented perspective to study whether students with different learning styles and SRL profiles show differences in navigating through a MOOC. Specifically, we investigate using Process Mining Techniques to analyze log files recording the course behavior of 99 learners across an Open edX MOOC combined with data from self-reported surveys. Our findings show that learners with different SRL profiles follow similar navigation paths, but there are differences when differentiating students by their learning styles.', 'TITLE: Analyzing Learners’ Behavior Beyond the MOOC: An Exploratory Study | KEYWORDS: Exploratory study; Learning Analytics; Massive Open Online Courses; MOOCs | ABSTRACT: Most of literature on massive open online courses (MOOCs) have focused on describing and predicting learner’s behavior with course trace data. However, little is known on the external resources beyond the MOOC they use to shape their learning experience, and how these interactions relate with their success in the course. This paper presents the results of an exploratory study that analyzes data from 572 learners in 4 MOOCs to understand (1) what the learners’ activities beyond the MOOC are, and (2) how they relate with their course performance. We analyzed frequencies of the students’ individual activities in and beyond the MOOC, and the transitions between these activities. Then, we analyzed the time spent on outside the MOOC content as well as the nature of this content. Finally, we predict which transitions better predict final learners’ grades. The results show that we can predict accurately students’ grades of the course using only internal-course fine-grained data of student’s interactions with video-lectures and exams combined with trace data of interactions with content outside the MOOCs. Also, data shows that learners spent 75% of their time on the MOOC, but go frequently to other content, mainly social networking sites, mail boxes and search engines.']"

This is especially true in zones where fishing operations occur in remote areas under harsh weather conditions. Crab fishery in Chile is exclusively artisanal, and marble crab (Metacarcinus edwardsii) has the highest landing records. This species is found in most parts of the coast of Chile, but it is mainly caught in the south of the country (including Patagonia). Fishery management is data-limited, and monitoring has not established the spatial and temporal variability baseline necessary to determine its exploitation status. This fishery is currently evaluated annually under a scheme based on reporting biological and fishery information, primarily from the landing ports and secondarily from fishing grounds. In the present study, we collected data from fishing grounds on board artisanal fishing vessels around 45°S during an annual cycle to establish indicators based on catch per unit effort (above and below minimum legal size), size, sex ratio, and the relationship between weight and size. Our results showed that fishery and biological indicators respond more to seasonal patterns than to expected spatial heterogeneity related to different fishing grounds: proportional stock density (lowest in winter), sex ratio (biased toward males in winter), retained catch (highest in autumn), and released catch (highest in winter), while the average size of the largest 10% of the sample only showed differences between males and females. Additionally, released catch varied according to soak time, which indicates the effectiveness of escape rings incorporated in the traps. These results lead to recommendations related to the current monitoring program, which should include the selection of a limited number of fishing grounds standardized by season and the incorporation of information related to soak time and the presence of escape rings. Finally, this study highlights the importance of on-board scientific monitoring for any fisheries, even those of small scale.', 'TITLE: Spatial distribution of small pelagic fishes: Implications for fishing quota allocations | KEYWORDS: Central southern Chile; ENSO; Fishing rights; Small pelagic fish; Spatial management | ABSTRACT: The upwelling ecosystem of central southern Chile sustains the pelagic common sardine and anchovy fisheries, which are managed by setting a global quota allocated to small-scale (artisanal) and industrial fishers.

Agriculture relies heavily on water for irrigation and production, making it vulnerable to water scarcity. Additionally, climate change can affect crop pest insects, leading to increased global crop losses, particularly in cereals, an important component of the human diet. Aphids are major crop pests and have a symbiotic relationship with bacterial endosymbionts that can contribute to their success as pests under a climate change scenario. To test the effect of drought on aphids, we examined varying levels of water deficit and endosymbiont composition on the grain aphid (Sitobion avenae) performance on wheat under controlled laboratory conditions. We measured the intrinsic rate of population increase (rm), the body weight of adult aphids, and the pre-reproductive period for different genotypes of the grain aphid (including Chilean superclones) under different irrigation regimes. We also analyzed the relative abundance of their endosymbionts under the different water treatments. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that water deficit affects each aphid genotype differently, impacting various traits. For instance, the body weight of adult aphids was notably affected by different water treatments, with aphids grown under intermediate water deficit (IW) being significantly bigger. The relative abundance of endosymbionts also varied among genotypes and water treatments—specifically Regiella insecticola had a noticeably higher abundance under IW (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insights into the impact of water deficit on aphid performance and the role of endosymbionts in mitigating the effects of water deficit. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.', ""TITLE: Diversity, frequency, and geographic distribution of facultative bacterial endosymbionts in introduced aphid pests | KEYWORDS: cereal aphids; facultative bacterial endosymbionts; grain aphid; introduced aphids; pea aphid | ABSTRACT: Facultative bacterial endosymbionts in insects have been under intense study during the last years. Endosymbionts can modify the insect's phenotype, conferring adaptive advantages under environmental stress. This seems particularly relevant for a group of worldwide agricultural aphid pests, because endosymbionts modify key fitness-related traits, including host plant use, protection against natural enemies and heat tolerance. Aimed to understand the role of facultative endosymbionts on the success of introduced aphid pests, the distribution and abundance of 5 facultative endosymbionts (Hamiltonella defensa, Regiella insecticola, Serratia symbiotica, Rickettsia and Spiroplasma) were studied and compared in 4 cereal aphids (Sitobion avenae, Diuraphis noxia, Metopolophium dirhodum and Schizaphis graminium) and in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum complex from 2 agroclimatic zones in Chile. Overall, infections with facultative endosymbionts exhibited a highly variable and characteristic pattern depending on the aphid species/host race and geographic zone, which could explain the success of aphid pest populations after their introduction. While S. symbiotica and H. defensa were the most frequent endosymbionts carried by the A. pisum pea-race and A. pisum alfalfa-race aphids, respectively, the most frequent facultative endosymbiont carried by all cereal aphids was R. insecticola. Interestingly, a highly variable composition of endosymbionts carried by S. avenae was also observed between agroclimatic zones, suggesting that endosymbionts are responding differentially to abiotic variables (temperature and precipitations). In addition, our findings constitute the first report of bacterial endosymbionts in cereal aphid species not screened before, and also the first report of aphid endosymbionts in Chile."", 'TITLE: Low bacterial community diversity in two introduced aphid pests revealed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing | KEYWORDS: 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing; Aphids; Bacterial community; Endosymbionts; Hamiltonella defensa; Phytopathogens; Pseudomonas; Regiella insecticola; Rhopalosiphum padi; Sitobion avenae | ABSTRACT: Bacterial endosymbionts that produce important phenotypic effects on their hosts are common among plant sap-sucking insects. Aphids have become a model system of insect-symbiont interactions. However, endosymbiont research has focused on a few aphid species, making it necessary to make greater efforts to other aphid species through different regions, in order to have a better understanding of the role of endosymbionts in aphids as a group. Aphid endosymbionts have frequently been studied by PCR-based techniques, using species-specific primers, nevertheless this approach may omit other non-target bacteria cohabiting a particular host species. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies are complementing our knowledge of microbial communities by allowing us the study of whole microbiome of different organisms. We used a 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing approach to study the microbiome of aphids in order to describe the bacterial community diversity in introduced populations of the cereal aphids, Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi in Chile (South America). An absence of secondary endosymbionts and two common secondary endosymbionts of aphids were found in the aphids R. padi and S. avenae, respectively. Of those endosymbionts, Regiella insecticola was the dominant secondary endosymbiont among the aphid samples. In addition, the presence of a previously unidentified bacterial species closely related to a phytopathogenic Pseudomonad species was detected. We discuss these results in relation to the bacterial endosymbiont diversity found in other regions of the native and introduced range of S. avenae and R. padi. A similar endosymbiont diversity has been reported for both aphid species in their native range. However, variation in the secondary endosymbiont infection could be observed among the introduced and native populations of the aphid S. avenae, indicating that aphid-endosymbiont associations can vary across the geographic range of an aphid species. In addition, we discuss the potential role of aphids as vectors and/or alternative hosts of phytopathogenic bacteria.']"

The objective of this paper is to estimate the PS needed for alighting at metro stations. For this purpose, laboratory experiments have been performed at University College London’s Pedestrian Accessibility Movement Environmental Laboratory. The experiments consisted of a mock-up of a carriage and the relevant portion of the platform, in which different load scenarios of boarding and alighting were conducted. The scenarios were based on a preliminary analysis observed at Westminster Station (with PEDs) and Green Park Station (without PEDs). To obtain the position of each passenger on the platform a tracking tool was used. The results show that the PS for alighting passengers can be represented as an asymmetrical ellipse, in which the longitudinal and lateral radii change according to the negotiations with other passengers alighting or waiting on the platform to board the train. Therefore, there is a relationship between the PS and the level of interaction, which suggests that passengers adjust their PS to avoid collision. This research can be used in pedestrian models by traffic engineers to estimate the PS of passengers boarding and alighting when PEDs are used. This in turn can help in designing the platform–train interface and platforms at transport infrastructures.', ""TITLE: Exploring the Effect of Boarding and Alighting Ratio on Passengers' Behaviour at Metro Stations by Laboratory Experiments | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: The objective of this work was to study the effect of the ratio between passengers boarding and alighting on the passengers' behaviour at metro stations. A mock-up of a vehicle and the relevant portion of the platform was built to run a series of simulation experiments at University College London's Pedestrian Accessibility and Movement Environment Laboratory (PAMELA). Different scenarios were tested based on the next generation London Underground trains. The scenarios were classified according to different load conditions. Four types of behaviour are described. In most cases boarding is first, and passengers compete for space to enter the train. In the case of alighting, first passengers are faster than the rest of alighters due to the space available on the platform as boarding passengers give way to those who are getting off the train. In addition, alighters form lanes of flow depending on the number of passengers waiting to board the train on the platform. With respect to the train, if the density inside the train is higher than 4 passengers per square metre, then the flow at the doors starts to decrease. More experiments are needed to study the relationship between platform density and boarding and alighting time."", 'TITLE: The Pedestrian Level of Service in Metro Stations: A Pilot Study Based on Passenger Detection Techniques | KEYWORDS: level of service; metro station; multidimensional; passenger detection; platform; train | ABSTRACT: The platform–train interface (PTI) is one of the most complex spaces in metro stations.

Nowadays, gold nanoprisms (GNPr) have become an emerging nanomaterial with a localized surface plasmon resonance in the biological window, showing applications in both detection and treatment of diseases. In this work, GNPr were functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and Angiopep-2 (Ang2) peptide to obtain a new highly stable nanomaterial and evaluate its toxicity and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a zebrafish larvae model. The success in the functionalization was confirmed by a full characterization that showed the physicochemical changes at each step. In turn, the colloidal stability of GNPr-PEG-Ang2 in biologically relevant media also was demonstrated. The toxicity assays of GNPr-PEG-Ang2 performed on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and on zebrafish larvae showed no effects both in vitro and in vivo. GNPr delivery to the CNS was studied in zebrafish larvae by immersion. We confirmed that functionalization with PEG-Ang2 improved the crossing through the BBB in this model compared with GNPr functionalized only with PEG. Notably, our nanomaterial was not detected in the CNS of zebrafish larvae 24 h after exposure that correlates with an adequate clearance of GNPr-PEG-Ang2 from the brain. This report is the first study of GNPr in the in vivo model of zebrafish larvae demonstrating that its functionalization with Ang2 allows the crossing of the BBB. Moreover, considering the stability achieved of the GNPr-PEG-Ang2 and the results of in vitro and in vivo studies, this work becomes a high contribution to the design of new nanomaterials with potential biomedical applications for CNS-related diseases.', 'TITLE: Intranasal administration of gold nanoparticles designed to target the central nervous system: Fabrication and comparison between nanospheres and nanoprisms | KEYWORDS: Central nervous system; Functionalized nanoparticles; Gold nanoparticles; Intranasal administration; Nose-to-brain delivery | ABSTRACT: The presence of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) limit gold nanoparticles (GNP) accumulation in central nervous system (CNS) after intravenous (IV) administration.

By comparing samples from eight spatially isolated sites in two different years (2006 and 2011), we analyzed the temporal and spatial variation of genetic diversity using 15 microsatellite loci. The results showed high levels of genetic diversity and high genetic differentiation between and within sample sites in both years. Our results suggest that there is temporal variation in gene flow direction probably drive it by oceanographic currents in the area and consequently larval dispersal at shorter distances might be expected. The Ne estimation suggests a complex demographic history and that inter-annual variability could affect the genetic structure in C. concholepas. This study highlights the importance of integrating temporal scales in the genetic studies of marine species.', 'TITLE: Weak connectivity and population cohesiveness in rudderfish Kyphosus sandwicensis (Teleostei: Kyphosidae) inhabiting remote oceanic islands | KEYWORDS: marine protected areas; population connectivity; Rapa Nui ecoregion; reef-associated fish | ABSTRACT: Population connectivity has a fundamental role in metapopulation dynamics, with important implications in conservation. Easter Island (EI) and Salas y Gómez Island (SG) in the Pacific Ocean are ideal for the study of population connectivity because they are separated by 415 km and isolated from other islands in the Pacific Ocean by >2,000 km. Considering that dispersal processes could play a critical role in the persistence of its populations, the connectivity pattern of the rudderfish Kyphosus sandwicensis was evaluated between EI and SG using both a population genetics and a biophysical modelling approach. The variability in the control region of the mitochondrial DNA did not show a significant phylogeographical pattern, and the variability in 16 microsatellite loci suggested that individuals of K. sandwicensis located at EI and SG belong to the same genetic population. However, historical migration showed that 0.2% of the recruits at EI come from SG and that 0.15% at SG come from EI per year. Using simulated larval release during September and a larval development of 30 days in the plankton, biophysical modelling did not detect migration between the islands. Furthermore, self-recruitment shows interannual variation ranging from 5 to 10% of the total released larvae. Whereas the genetic data showed a lack of population genetic structure but low connectivity of K. sandwicensis between EI and SG, the biophysical modelling showed null movement of particles between the islands. Stochastic movement of larvae or adults could explain the pattern observed, with rafting as an example. These low-frequency and stochastic movements may be important in maintaining the cohesiveness between EI and SG.', ""TITLE: Integrating genetic and biophysical approaches to estimate connectivity in an isolated, insular system: Case of the culturally important marine gastropod Monetaria caputdraconis | KEYWORDS: Easter Island; endemic cowry gastropod; larval connectivity; oceanic islands; population genetic | ABSTRACT: Population connectivity has a fundamental role in metapopulation dynamics with important implications for population persistence in space and time. Oceanic islands, such as Easter Island (EI) and the Salas & Gómez Island (SG), are ideal for the study of population connectivity because they are separated by 415 km and isolated from other islands in the Pacific Ocean by >2000 km. Considering that the dispersal process could play a critical role in the persistence of their populations, we evaluated the connectivity pattern of the endemic gastropod Monetaria caputdraconis between EI and SG using population genetics and biophysical modelling. Eleven microsatellite loci did not show differences in the allelic frequency of individuals located in EI and SG, suggesting the presence of one genetic population. Historical reciprocal migration implies that 0.49% of the recruits in EI come from SG and 0.37% in SG come from EI. Considering year-round larval release and a larval development of 2 weeks in the plankton, a Lagrangian experiment based on a regional oceanic simulation indicated a weak population connectivity with a high rate of self-recruitment. Interestingly, self-recruitment showed both monthly and interannual variation ranging from 1 to 45% of returned larvae, with lower values estimated in SG compared to EI. The results suggest that few larvae/individuals arrive at each other's island, possibly due to stochastic events, such as rafting. Overall, our results indicate that both islands maintain population connectivity despite their distance; these findings have implications for designing conservation strategies in this region.""]"

The doping of phosphorene with Ni or Cu atoms remarkably increases the uptake stability of arsenite at water environments compared to intrinsic phosphorene, with a weak competition of H2O molecules by the adsorption sites, where the adatom doping of phosphorene allows obtaining better uptake performance compared to the substitutional doping. The uptake is explained by a strong inner-sphere surface complexation, which is dominated by permanent electrostatic physical effects. Hydroxide anions show strong competitive adsorption compared to H2O and arsenite; thus, the straightforward recovery of the nanoadsorbents could be reached after removal by treatment at high pH solutions. Therefore, metal-doped phosphorene hybrids could serve as superior nanoadsorbents for arsenic separation from water by adsorption in solid phases.', 'TITLE: Tailoring the arsenic(III) removal ability from water using metal-organic frameworks via metal exchange – A computational study | KEYWORDS: Adsorption; Adsorption energy; Chemical engineering; DFT calculations; Environmental chemistry; Environmental pollution | ABSTRACT: Searching and developing efficient adsorbent materials for arsenic removal is critical in water treatment. Recently, Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have gained attention due to their chemical stability and ability to capture water-soluble arsenic species. Here, we performed a computational chemistry study of the arsenic removal ability by the Zn-based MOF, MFU-4l [Zn4(Td)Zn(Oh)Cl4(BTDD)3], and the effects of metal exchange [M-MFU-4l, where M = Fe(II), Ni(II), Cu(II)]. Our results show that M-MFU-4l based adsorbents promote the inner-sphere surface adsorption of arsenic in a wide range of pH. Metal exchange with Fe(II) species promotes a bidentate arsenic uptake, resulting in the highest adsorption ability compared to the reference system MFU-4l. Energy decomposition analyses (ALMO-EDA) reveal that electrostatic and polarization driving forces dominate the adsorption mechanism, providing a partial orbital overlapping (coordinative bonding). In addition, thermochemical analyses reveal that arsenic adsorption is a spontaneous and exothermic process at room temperature for pristine, Cu(II) and Fe(II)-based MOFs, which are retained in a wide range of operating temperatures (298–1000 K). Finally, solvent effects have a weak influence on the adsorption stability because attractive electrostatic effects overcompensate the solvation destabilization, while the recovery of the adsorbent materials can be straightforwardly reached by treatment with phosphate-based eluents for repetitive cycles of use. Therefore, this study would provide new insights into MOFs application as technology remediation for arsenic removal from water.', 'TITLE: A first-principles study on the adsorption properties of phosphorene oxide for pollutant removal from water | KEYWORDS: Environmental pollution; Nanotechnology; Surface science; Water pollution | ABSTRACT: Phosphorene-based materials have emerged as useful platforms for new technological applications, including their potential implementation in the solid-phase extraction of pollutants. In this study, we implemented a first-principles study to characterize the interactions between water-soluble pollutants and phosphorene oxide (PhosO) at the microscopic level, providing useful mechanistic insights into the role of phosphorene oxidation in its adsorption/removal ability. Continuum/explicit solvent effects were considered to explain the solvent role, and the ALMO-EDA method characterizes the intermolecular forces. Our results show that PhosO significantly adsorbs pollutants on its surface by inner surface adsorption, even under aqueous environments, and provides remarkable adsorption stability for a wide family of water-soluble emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, flame retardants, and industrial chemicals) with adsorption energies of 0.53 to 1.17 eV. The stabilizing energy in solution is driven by a balanced contribution of dispersion and electrostatic driving forces (up to 83% of the stabilizing energy), overcompensating all the destabilizing effects from the solvation process and Pauli repulsion. Furthermore, PhosO promotes low pollutant mobility from its surface under water molecules, which are not competitive factors in the adsorption process. In addition, simulations under dynamic conditions show that the electrostatic/dispersion governed mechanism remains stable at room conditions for real-life applications (300 K, 1 atm). Finally, a bandgap increase of 0.73 eV is noted in PhosO upon pollutant adsorption, giving a suitable framework for further sensing applications of contaminants by increasing the metallic character of PhosO. These results expand the understanding of the role of phosphorene oxidation for its use as a removal platform in water treatment technologies.']"

Dysfunction of the cilium is associated with impairment of autophagy and diseases known as “ciliopathies”. The discovery of autophagy-related proteins at the base of the cilium suggests its potential role in coordinating autophagy initiation in response to physiopathological stimuli. One of these proteins, beclin-1 (BECN1), it which is necessary for autophagosome biogenesis. Additionally, polycystin-2 (PKD2), a calcium channel enriched at the cilium, is required and sufficient to induce autophagy in renal and cancer cells. We previously demonstrated that PKD2 and BECN1 form a protein complex at the endoplasmic reticulum in non-ciliated cells, where it initiates autophagy, but whether this protein complex is present at the cilium remains unknown. Anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are ciliated cells that require autophagy to maintain intracellular homeostasis. POMC neurons are sensitive to metabolic changes, modulating signaling pathways crucial for controlling food intake. Exposure to the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid (PA) reduces ciliogenesis and inhibits autophagy in these cells. Here, we show that PKD2 and BECN1 form a protein complex in N43/5 cells, an in vitro model of POMC neurons, and that both PKD2 and BECN1 locate at the cilium. In addition, our data show that the cilium is required for PKD2-BECN1 protein complex formation and that PA disrupts the PKD2-BECN1 complex, suppressing autophagy. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which the cilium controls autophagy in hypothalamic neuronal cells.', 'TITLE: PKD2/polycystin-2 induces autophagy by forming a complex with BECN1 | KEYWORDS: Autophagy; beclin 1; calcium; polycystin-2; protein complex | ABSTRACT: Macroautophagy/autophagy is an intracellular process involved in the breakdown of macromolecules and organelles.

Here, we report that PKD2 forms a protein complex with BECN1 (beclin 1), a key protein required for the formation of autophagic vacuoles, by acting as a scaffold that interacts with several co-modulators via its coiled-coil domain (CCD). Our data identified a physical and functional interaction between PKD2 and BECN1, which depends on one out of two CCD domains (CC1), located in the carboxy-terminal tail of PKD2. In addition, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA-AM not only blunted starvation-induced autophagy but also disrupted the PKD2-BECN1 complex. Consistently, PKD2 overexpression triggered autophagy by increasing its interaction with BECN1, while overexpression of PKD2D509V, a Ca2+ channel activity-deficient mutant, did not induce autophagy and manifested diminished interaction with BECN1.

The aim of this study was to describe in vivo the prevalence and location of the MB2 in the mesiobuccal root of the first maxillary molar (1MM) and the second maxillary molar (2MM) through CBCT imaging. Methods: Five hundred fifty CBCT images of the 1MM and 550 of the 2MM were analyzed. To detect the MB2 canal, the observation and measurements were done 1 mm apically to the pulpal floor to standardize the methodology. The geometric location of the central point of the MB2 canal (PMB2) was measured in relation to the central point of the mesiobuccal canal (PMB1) and in relation to the line projected between the PMB1 and the central point of the palatal canals (PP). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, with a value of P < 0.05 being statistically significant. Results: In the 1MM, the prevalence of the MB2 canal was 69.82% and was more frequent in women (p = 0.005). The distance between PMB1 and PP was 7.64 ± 1.04 mm.

Two hundred twenty five CBCT images of 2 MM were studied. In the presence of the MB2 canal, the floor of the coronal cavity was located and advanced every 1 mm apically to standardize observation. The geometric location in relation to the primary mesiobuccal (MB1) and palatal (P) canals was done by locating the central points of the canal and projecting a line between them, together with a perpendicular line between MB1-P (point T).

In this study, the effects of soil management intensity on soil organic carbon (SOC) content and its labile fractions, i.e., water-soluble organic carbon (OC-sol) and permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), were evaluated in a volcanic-ash-derived soil (Andisol) with a very high soil organic matter (SOM) content (>20%). These indicators were associated with water-stable aggregates (WSAs) and biological indicators, namely, earthworm density, cellulase activity, and autoclaved-citrate-extractable (ACE) proteins, related to the decomposition of SOM and its physical protection. The conditions evaluated were secondary native forest (SF), naturalized grassland (NG), no-till (NT), and conventional tillage (CT), considering the last item to be representative of a higher agriculture management intensity. Soil samples were collected by horizon. The SF and NG soil showed higher contents of SOC, OC-sol, and POXC. When comparing the evaluated annual cropping systems, NT showed higher values than CT (p < 0.05) in the first horizon (Hz1), while similar values were found at deeper horizons. The highest cellulase activity, ACE protein levels, and earthworm densities were found in NG and SF. NT also showed significantly higher levels of the aforementioned factors than CT (p < 0.05). A positive and significant relationship was found between the SOC content and WSA (R2 = 0.76; p < 0.05) in the whole profile and between POXC and WSA for Hz1 (R2 = 0.67; p < 0.05). Soil C storage was affected by the intensity of agricultural management, mainly because of the effect of tillage on structural stability, considering that biological activity synthesizes compounds such as enzymes and proteins that react and adhere to the mineral fraction affecting aggregate stability. The C content stored in the soil is consequently a key indicator with which to regulate SOM and protect SOC.', 'TITLE: Management and liming-induced changes in organo-Al/Fe complexes and amorphous mineral-associated organic carbon: Implications for carbon sequestration in volcanic soils | KEYWORDS: Allophane; Carbon sequestration; Density fractions; Land use; Selective dissolution | ABSTRACT: Amorphous mineral-associated organic carbon (AMAOC) and organo-Al/Fe complexes (Cp) play crucial roles in soil carbon (C) sequestration in volcanic soils. This study investigated the effects of land use management and liming on the C sequestration capacity of a young allophanic Andisol and old halloysitic-kaolinitic volcanic Ultisol sampled at 0–10 and 10–20 cm depth. This study was designed to test two hypotheses: (1) management and liming affect the C sequestration capacity of Andisol by reducing Cp and increasing AMAOC to offset Cp losses, and (2) they do not significantly affect the carbon sequestration capacity of Ultisol because of its more crystalline mineral forms and reduced amount of Cp. This study was conducted using a selective dissolution technique and density fractionation with agricultural soils and forests as control soils. After 43 years of intensive management and liming, the soil organic carbon (SOC) content decreased by 32% in the topsoil compared to the original native forest soil (178 ± 2 g kg−1 soil), mainly in the particulate organic matter (POM) fraction, which decreased by 74% compared to the native forest soil (61 ± 9 g kg−1 soil). However, Cp decreased only by 40% compared to the forest soil (62 ± 1 g kg−1 soil) from pHKCl 4.8–5.0, and AMAOC increased in 17% in the topsoil and 64% in the subsoil, supporting the first hypothesis of this study. In the cultivated Ultisol, SOC decreased by 35% due to the POM fraction, and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC) decreased by 37% compared to the forest soil (38 ± 7 g kg−1 soil). These results partially support the second hypothesis because the crystalline clay minerals from which MAOC originated remained unchanged and were strongly correlated with SOC. The mass balance of both soils indicated that the stable C losses from native forest soils were < 14%.

Split blastocysts can develop to term; however, little is known about the impact on gene expression of split embryos, especially at the whole transcriptome level. This work was aimed to evaluate the effect of blastocyst splitting on global gene expression profile at the elongation stage. For that, split and time-matched nonsplit (control group) bovine blastocysts were transferred to a bovine recipient and recovered at Day 17 of development. The number of collected embryos, their size, and global gene expression was compared between both groups. From 16 transferred split embryos, six (37.5%) were collected, whereas nine elongated were recovered from 17 nonsplit (52.9%). Neither the recovery rate nor the average length of the elongated embryos was significantly different between both groups. However more than 50% of embryos from the control group had a length surpassing 100 mm, whereas only 33% of the split embryos reached that size. Global gene expression was performed in individual elongated embryos from both groups using Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis. From detected genes, 383 (1.31%) were differentially expressed between both groups, among them, 185 (0.63%) were downregulated and 198 (0.67%) genes were upregulated in split embryos. Bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that embryo splitting affects transcriptomes of resulting elongated embryos, mainly downregulating genes involved in matrix remodelation, control of growth, detoxification, and transport of metabolites.

The same analysis is also used to search for four-top-quark production in several new physics scenarios.

Although they exhibit a high degree of polymorphism, skeletal plasticity and are considered a novel model to assess the effects of delayed puberty on the skeletal system, scarce information on their morphogenesis exists. Here, we examined a large ontogenetic sample (n = 76) of subordinate individuals to assess the pattern of bone growth and bone microstructure of fore- and hindlimb bones by using histomorphological techniques. Over 290 undecalcified thin cross-sections from the midshaft of the humerus, ulna, femur, and tibia from pups, juveniles and adults were analyzed with polarized light microscopy. Similar to other fossorial mammals, NMRs exhibited a systematic cortical thickening of their long bones, which clearly indicates a conserved functional adaptation to withstand the mechanical strains imposed during digging, regardless of their chisel-tooth predominance. We describe a high histodiversity of bone matrices and the formation of secondary osteons in NMRs. The bones of pups are extremely thin-walled and grow by periosteal bone formation coupled with considerable expansion of the medullary cavity, a process probably tightly regulated and adapted to optimize the amount of minerals destined for skeletal development, to thus allow the female breeder to produce a higher number of pups, as well as several litters. Subsequent cortical thickening in juveniles involves high amounts of endosteal bone apposition, which contrasts with the bone modeling of other mammals where a periosteal predominance exists. Adults have bone matrices predominantly consisting of parallel-fibered bone and lamellar bone, which indicate intermediate to slow rates of osteogenesis, as well as the development of poorly vascularized lamellar-zonal tissues separated by lines of arrested growth (LAGs) and annuli. These features reflect the low metabolism, low body temperature and slow growth rates reported for this species, as well as indicate a cyclical pattern of osteogenesis. The presence of LAGs in captive individuals was striking and indicates that postnatal osteogenesis and its consequent cortical stratification most likely represents a plesiomorphic thermometabolic strategy among endotherms which has been suggested to be regulated by endogenous rhythms. However, the generalized presence of LAGs in this and other subterranean taxa in the wild, as well as recent investigations on variability of environmental conditions in burrow systems, supports the hypothesis that underground environments experience seasonal fluctuations that may influence the postnatal osteogenesis of animals by limiting the extension of burrow systems during the unfavorable dry seasons and therefore the finding of food resources. Additionally, the intraspecific variation found in the formation of bone tissue matrices and vascularization suggested a high degree of developmental plasticity in NMRs, which may help explaining the polymorphism reported for this species. The results obtained here represent a valuable contribution to understanding the relationship of several aspects involved in the morphogenesis of the skeletal system of a mammal with extraordinary adaptations.', 'TITLE: Cortical bone adaptation and mineral mobilization in the subterranean mammal Bathyergus suillus (Rodentia: Bathyergidae): Effects of age and sex | KEYWORDS: Bone compactness; Bone microstructure; Cortical bone; Fossorial adaptations; Histomorphometry; Intracortical porosity; Resorption cavities; Sexual dimorphism; Skeletal homeostasis | ABSTRACT: The patterns of bone modeling and mineral mobilization (skeletal homeostasis) among mammals other than humans and laboratory rodents are still poorly known. In this study we assessed the pattern of bone formation and bone resorption in the femur of a wild population of Cape dune molerats, Bathyergus suillus (n = 41) (Bathyergidae), a solitary subterranean mammal with a marked extended longevity among rodents, and which also lives in a naturally deficient state of vitamin D. In order to determine ontogenetic and sex effects on histomorphometric parameters of transversal undecalcified bone sections, two-way ANOVA, linear mixed-effects model and regression statistical analyses were performed. During ontogeny, B. suillus increased their cross sectional area, cortical area and cortical thickness, and most importantly, they showed scarce endosteal bone resorption which resulted in a retained medullary cavity size during ontogeny. This resulted in a positively imbalanced bone modeling, where bone formation considerably surpasses bone loss by almost 100-fold in adulthood. This differs markedly from other terrestrial mammals with relatively thin cortical walls. Regarding bone loss and remodeling, three main processes involving intracortical resorption were observed: modelingrelated bone loss in early postnatal growth; secondary osteon formation occurring in both sexes; and subendosteal secondary reconstruction observed only in females. The latter is accompanied by females having six-fold more relative bone loss than males, which is evidenced by the development of enlarged resorption cavities (RCs) distributed circumferentially around the medullary cavity. Males have smaller, more circular and randomly distributed RCs. In general, our data indicate no age-related decline in mineral content in B. suillus, and provides strong support for a pattern of sexual dimorphism in skeletal homeostasis, similar to that occurring in humans and other mammals, with females losing more bone throughout aging as compared to males due to reproductive factors. Interestingly as well, despite the high mechanical loads experienced during burrow construction, bone remodeling in B. suillus is kept at very low levels throughout their lifespan, and dense Haversian tissue never forms. This study represents the first comprehensive assessment of skeletal homeostasis in a subterranean mammal, and it enables a better understanding of the complex processes governing the acquisition and maintenance of bone properties in this species with extraordinary fossorial adaptations.', 'TITLE: Long bone histology of the subterranean rodent Bathyergus suillus (Bathyergidae): ontogenetic pattern of cortical bone thickening | KEYWORDS: bone microstructure; bone modeling; fossorial adaptations; mammal bone histology; ontogeny; osteohistology; rodent bone histology; subterranean mammals | ABSTRACT: Patterns of bone development in mammals are best known from terrestrial and cursorial groups, but there is a considerable gap in our understanding of how specializations for life underground affect bone growth and development. Likewise, studies of bone microstructure in wild populations are still scarce, and they often include few individuals and tend to be focused on adults. For these reasons, the processes generating bone microstructural variation at intra- and interspecific levels are not fully understood. This study comprehensively examines the bone microstructure of an extant population of Cape dune molerats, Bathyergus suillus (Bathyergidae), the largest subterranean mammal endemic to the Western Cape of South Africa. The aim of this study is to investigate the postnatal bone growth of B. suillus using undecalcified histological sections (n = 197) of the femur, humerus, tibia-fibula, ulna and radius, including males and females belonging to different ontogenetic and reproductive stages (n = 42). Qualitative histological features demonstrate a wide histodiversity with thickening of the cortex mainly resulting from endosteal and periosteal bone depositions, whilst there is scarce endosteal resorption and remodeling throughout ontogeny. This imbalanced bone modeling allows the tissues deposited during ontogeny to remain relatively intact, thus preserving an excellent record of growth. The distribution of the different bone tissues observed in the cortex depends on ontogenetic status, anatomical features (e.g. muscle attachment structures) and location on the bone (e.g. anterior or lateral). The type of bone microstructure and modeling is discussed in relation to digging behavior, reproduction and physiology of this species. This study is the first histological assessment describing the process of cortical thickening in long bones of a fossorial mammal.']"

However, residues may remain in products and by-products destined for human consumption or animal feeding. The claws of chickens, which are a by-product of the poultry industry, can directly or indirectly enter the food chain as meals destined to feed other productive animals. Thus, it becomes necessary to determine and quantify antimicrobial residues present in this matrix. The objective of the study was to assess the depletion of oxytetracycline (OTC) and its metabolite 4-epi-OTC in broiler chicken’s claws. Claws of 32 broilers treated with a therapeutic dosage of 10% OTC during 7 days were analysed. Samples were taken at days 3, 9, 15 and 19 post-treatment. As for the control group, eight broiler chickens were raised under the same conditions. Extraction was carried out through EDTA-McIlvaine buffer, and clean-up employed a SPE C-18 Sep-Pak®. Instrumental analysis was performed through LC-MS/MS. The concentrations of both analytes were determined in claw samples until day 19 post-treatment. Average concentrations were within the LOD (20 μg kg– 1) and LOQ (22 µg kg– 1) for OTC and 84 μg kg– 1 for 4-epi-OTC. Withdrawal times (WDTs) of 39 days for OTC and 54 days for 4-epi-OTC were established in claws based on 95% confidence. These findings demonstrate that claws can be a source of antimicrobial residue entry into the food chain, since the results showed that OTC and its metabolite can be found in chicken’s claws for long periods, even exceeding the average lifespan of a broiler chicken.', 'TITLE: Determination of oxytetracycline and 4-epi-oxytetracycline residues in feathers and edible tissues of broiler chickens using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry | KEYWORDS: 4-Epi-oxytetracycline; Antimicrobial agent; Feathers; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Oxytetracycline; Residues | ABSTRACT: Antibiotics have been widely used in poultry production for the treatment of bacterial diseases. However, drug residues can remain in products derived from animals after the cessation of the drug therapies. Feathers, in particular, have shown an affinity for antibiotics such as tetracycline, suggesting the persistence of these drugs in nonedible tissue. After the birds are slaughtered, feathers are ground into feather meals, which are used as organic fertilizer or an ingredient in animal diets, thereby entering into the food chain and becoming a potential risk for public health. To evaluate the depletion of oxytetracycline (OTC) and its metabolite 4-epi-oxytetracycline (4-epi-OTC) in the muscles, liver, and feathers, 64 broiler chickens, bred under controlled conditions, were treated orally with a commercial formulation of 10% OTC for 7 days. The analytes were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. OTC and 4-epi-OTC were found in the feathers for 46 days, whereas they were found in the muscle and liver for only 12 and 6 days, respectively. These results prove that the analytes remain in feathers in higher concentrations than they do in edible tissues after treatment with tetracyclines. Thus, feather meals represent a potential source of antimicrobial residue contamination in the food chain.']"

Moreover, experimental testing in spacecraft environments can be difficult and expensive, so using ground-based tests to inform microgravity tests is vital. Reducing buoyancy effects by decreasing ambient pressure is a possible approach to simulate a spacecraft environment on earth. The objective of this work is to study the effect of pressure on material flammability, and by comparison with microgravity data, determine the extent to which reducing pressure can be used to simulate reduced gravity. Specifically, this work studies the effect of pressure and microgravity on upward/concurrent flame spread rates and flame appearance of a burning thin composite fabric made of 75% cotton and 25% fiberglass (Sibal). Experiments in normal gravity were conducted using pressures ranging between 100 and 30 kPa and a forced flow velocity of 20 cm/s. Microgravity experiments were conducted during NASA's Spacecraft Fire Experiment (Saffire), on board of the Orbital Corporation Cygnus spacecraft at 100 kPa and an air flow velocity of 20 cm/s. Results show that reductions of ambient pressure slow the flame spread over the fabric. As pressure is reduced, flame intensity is also reduced. Comparison with the concurrent flame spread rates in microgravity show that similar flame spread rates are obtained at around 30 kPa. The normal gravity and microgravity data is correlated in terms of a mixed convection non-dimensional parameter that describes the heat transferred from the flame to the solid surface. The correlation provides information about the similitudes of the flame spread process in variable pressure and reduced gravity environments, providing guidance for potential on-earth testing for fire safety design in spacecraft and space habitats."", ""TITLE: Buoyancy effects on concurrent flame spread over thick PMMA | KEYWORDS: Environmental conditions; Flame spread rate; Low pressure; Microgravity; PMMA | ABSTRACT: The flammability of combustible materials in a spacecraft is important for fire safety applications because the conditions in spacecraft environments differ from those on earth. Experimental testing in space is difficult and expensive. However, reducing buoyancy by decreasing ambient pressure is a possible approach to simulate on-earth the burning behavior inside spacecraft environments. The objective of this work is to determine that possibility by studying the effect of pressure on concurrent flame spread, and by comparison with microgravity data, observe up to what point low-pressure can be used to replicate flame spread characteristics observed in microgravity. Specifically, this work studies the effect of pressure and microgravity on upward/concurrent flame spread over 10 mm thick polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) slabs. Experiments in normal gravity were conducted over pressures ranging between 100 and 40 kPa and a forced flow velocity of 200 mm/s. Microgravity experiments were conducted during NASA's Spacecraft Fire Experiment (Saffire II), on board the Cygnus spacecraft at 100 kPa with an air flow velocity of 200 mm/s. Results show that reductions of pressure slow down the flame spread over the PMMA surface approaching that in microgravity. The data is correlated in terms of a non-dimensional mixed convection analysis that describes the convective heat transferred from the flame to the solid, and the primary mechanism controlling the spread of the flame. The extrapolation of the correlation to low pressures predicts well the flame spread rate obtained in microgravity in the Saffire II experiments. Similar results were obtained by the authors with similar experiments with a thin composite cotton/fiberglass fabric (published elsewhere). Both results suggest that reduced pressure can be used to approximately replicate flame behavior of untested gravity conditions for the burning of thick and thin solids. This work could provide guidance for potential ground-based testing for fire safety design in spacecraft and space habitats."", 'TITLE: Concurrent flame spread over externally heated Nomex under mixed convection flow | KEYWORDS: Buoyancy; External heating; Fire resistant fabric; Flame spread | ABSTRACT: Fire-resistant materials are used in multiple applications where protection from fire is needed. Their fire-resistant capacity is often tested under specific conditions that might not represent the situation in an actual fire. Particularly relevant for this work is the application for astronaut spacesuit, since a spacecraft environment may be different than earth atmospheres. There, a material is exposed to low velocity flows, microgravity, reduced pressure, and enriched oxygen concentration. Under these conditions, material flammability can be altered. In addition, flammability tests are based primarily on the exposure of the material to an external radiant flux to simulate an adjacent fire, but not a real flame. In this work, an experimental study was performed to investigate the effect of ambient pressure and oxygen concentration on the concurrent/upward flame spread over a fire-resistant fabric (Nomex HT90-40) exposed to two different external heat sources. One is the radiation from infrared lamps, and the other is the flame from a burning polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheet placed below the fabric. The experimental results show that an external heat flux extends the limiting oxygen concentration (24% LOC) of Nomex. This effect is more pronounced when the PMMA flame provides the heat flux (17% LOC). For oxygen concentrations larger than the Nomex LOC, the flame spread rate decreases as the ambient pressure is decreased, indicating that reducing buoyancy reduces the flame spread rate. A simple analysis of concurrent flame spread that incorporates mixed flow heat transfer correlates well with the experimental data. This suggest that flame spread in microgravity can be predicted in terms of a mixed flow velocity that includes the Reynolds and Grashof numbers. The results of this work provide further information about the effect of the type of external heating on material flammability. They may also guide future fire safety design in space exploration.']"

Herein, we report the genome sequence and comparative genomic analysis of a new Exiguobacterium strain, sp. SH31, isolated from an altiplanic shallow athalassohaline lake. Exiguobacterium sp. SH31 belongs to the phylogenetic Group II and its closest relative is Exiguobacterium sp. S17, isolated from the Argentinian Altiplano (95% average nucleotide identity). Strain SH31 encodes a wide repertoire of proteins required for cadmium, copper, mercury, tellurium, chromium, and arsenic resistance. Of the 34 Exiguobacterium genomes that were inspected, only isolates SH31 and S17 encode the arsenic efflux pump Acr3. Strain SH31 was able to grow in up to 10 mM arsenite and 100 mM arsenate, indicating that it is arsenic resistant. Further, expression of the ars operon and acr3 was strongly induced in response to both toxics, suggesting that the arsenic efflux pump Acr3 mediates arsenic resistance in Exiguobacterium sp.

Microbial communities in SH are exposed to low atmospheric pressure, high UV radiation, wide temperature ranges, salinity gradient and the presence of toxic compounds such as arsenic (As). In this work we focus on arsenic stress as one of the main adverse factors in SH and bacteria that belong to the Exiguobacterium genus due to their plasticity and ubiquity. Therefore, our aim was to shed light on the effect of niche conditions pressure (particularly arsenic), on the adaptation and divergence (at genotypic and phenotypic levels) of Exiguobacterium strains from five different SH sites. Also, to capture greater diversity in this genus, we use as outgroup five As(III) sensitive strains isolated from Easter Island (Chile) and The Great Salt Lake (United States). For this, samples were obtained from five different SH sites under an arsenic gradient (9 to 321 mg/kg: sediment) and isolated and sequenced the genomes of 14 Exiguobacterium strains, which had different arsenic tolerance levels. Then, we used comparative genomic analysis to assess the genomic divergence of these strains and their association with phenotypic differences such as arsenic tolerance levels and the ability to resist poly-stress. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SH strains share a common ancestor. Consequently, populations were separated and structured in different SH microenvironments, giving rise to multiple coexisting lineages. Hence, this genotypic variability is also evidenced by the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) composition and the size of their accessory genomes. Interestingly, these observations correlate with physiological traits such as growth patterns, gene expression, and enzyme activity related to arsenic response and/or tolerance.

This could depend on their affinity to the dopamine transporter. The possible molecular mechanisms involved in dopamine and L-dopa neurotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons are discussed. Dopamine seems to be neurotoxic in dopaminergic neurons by undergoing oxidation to aminochrome, which is the precursor to neuromelanin. However, aminochrome can be neurotoxic when it forms adducts with proteins such as alpha-synuclein, alpha- and betatubulin, and H-type ATPase, or when aminochrome is one-electron reduced by flavoenzymes that use NADH, generating redox cycling, depletion of energy, and the formation of reactive oxygen species. L-dopa is also neurotoxic in cell cultures after oxidizing to a quinone species, but L-dopa seems to be a transient precursor of dopamine in that it is not able to induce neurotoxicity in vivo due to the efficient decarboxylation to dopamine catalyzed by amino acid decarboxylase. L-dopa is used in Parkinson’s disease treatment. It seems that L-dopa itself does not accelerate dopaminergic neuron degeneration because L-dopa is efficiently converted to dopamine. However, L-dopa induces dyskinesias in approximately 40% patients with 4–6 years of treatment. It is also unclear whether L-dopa modifies the course of the disease, although protective effects have recently been described. It is possible that the majority of dopamine release to the striatum is mediated by serotonergic neurons without regulation, resulting in dyskinesias. This chapter also discusses L-dopa’s role in the formation of melanoma in the skin of patients treated chronically with this drug.', 'TITLE: Individual Differences in Amphetamine Locomotor Sensitization are Accompanied with Changes in Dopamine Release and Firing Pattern in the Dorsolateral Striatum of Rats | KEYWORDS: amphetamine; dorsolateral striatum; individual differences; locomotor sensitization; microdialysis; single unit recording | ABSTRACT: Not all the people that consume drugs of abuse develop addiction. In this sense, just a percentage of rats express locomotor sensitization after repeated psychostimulant exposure. Neurochemical evidence has shown that locomotor sensitization is associated with changes in dorsolateral striatum (DLS) activity. However, it is unknown if individual differences observed in locomotor sensitization are related to differential neuro-adaptations in DLS activity. In this study, we measured basal dopamine (DA) levels and single unit activity in the DLS of anesthetized rats, after repeated amphetamine (AMPH) administration. Rats were treated with AMPH 1.0 mg/kg ip or saline ip for 5 days. Following 5 days of withdrawal, a challenge dose of AMPH 1.0 mg/kg ip was injected. In-vivo microdialysis experiments and single unit recording were carried out twenty-four hours after the last AMPH injection. Sensitized rats showed increased basal DA levels and baseline firing rate of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) compared to non-sensitized rats. The local variation index (Lv) was used to measure the firing pattern of MSNs. In saline rats, a bursty firing pattern was observed in MSNs. A decrease in MSNs baseline Lv accompanies the expression of AMPH locomotor sensitization. Moreover, a decrease in Lv after an acute AMPH 1.0 mg/kg injection was only observed in saline and sensitized rats. Our results show individual differences in DLS basal DA levels and firing pattern after repeated AMPH administration, suggesting that an hyperfunction of nigrostriatal pathway, accompanied by a decrease in DLS MSNs firing irregularity underlies the expression of AMPH locomotor sensitization.', ""TITLE: Dopamine and L-dopa as selective endogenous neurotoxins | KEYWORDS: Aminochrome; Dopamine; Dyskinesia; L-dopa; Metabolism; Neurotoxicity; Neurotoxins; Orthoquinones; Oxidation; Parkinson's disease | ABSTRACT: Selective neurotoxins have the ability to exert their neurotoxic effects in some specific neuronal systems. In dopaminergic neurons, the selectivity of exogenous neurotoxins depends on their affinity to the dopamine transporter. However, dopamine and 3,4- L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) are synthesized in dopaminergic neurons and are likewise able to induce neurotoxicity. The possible molecular mechanisms involved in dopamine and L-dopa neurotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons are discussed. Dopamine seems to be neurotoxic in dopaminergic neurons by undergoing oxidation to aminochrome, which is the precursor to neuromelanin. However, aminochrome can be neurotoxic when it forms adducts with proteins such as alpha- synuclein, parkin, mitochondrial complexes I and III, actin, tubulin, and the dopamine transporter, or when aminochrome is one-electron reduced by flavoenzymes that use NADH, generating redox cycling with the concomitant depletion of energy and the formation of reactive oxygen species. L-dopa is also neurotoxic in cell cultures after oxidizing to a quinone species, but L-dopa seems to be a transient precursor of dopamine in that it is not able to induce neurotoxicity in vivo due to the efficient decarboxylation to dopamine catalyzed by amino acid decarboxylase. In fact, the only metabolite found in vivo is L-3-o-methyldopa, as detected in microdialysis experiments in animals treated with L-dopa. L-dopa is used in Parkinson's disease treatment, and it is still questionable whether L-dopa accelerates the degeneration of remaining dopaminergic neurons. It seems that L-dopa itself does not accelerate dopaminergic neuron degeneration because L-dopa is efficiently converted to dopamine, both in the peripheral and the central nervous systems. However, L-dopa induces dyskinesias in approximately 40 % patients with 4-6 years of treatment, and although the mechanism for L-dopa-induced dyskinesias is very complex, the rapid oscillation of striatal dopamine during L-dopa treatment has been found to be required for the induction of dyskinesias. The remaining dopaminergic neurons convert L-dopa to dopamine and release dopamine to the striatum under regulated conditions, but the majority of dopamine release to the striatum is mediated by serotonergic neurons without regulation, resulting in dyskinesias.""]"

This study attempts to build a connection between visible-light photolysis and demethylation processes of methylamine compounds, such as TBO+. We show that controlled photoinduced mono- and double-demethylation of TBO+ can be achieved. The kinetics for the appearance rate of the mono-demethylated TBO+ and the double-demethylated TBO+ were found to fit pseudo-first-order kinetics. DFT calculations have been used to examine the demethylation of TBO+ and included N,N-dimethylaniline as a model compound for TBO+. The results show an oxygen-dependent demethylation process. The mechanism for the sequential methyl loss is proposed to be due to H• or e-/H+ transfer to 3TBO+∗ followed by a reaction of TBO+• with O2, yielding a C-peroxyTBO+• intermediate. Instead of aminyl radical peroxyl formation, i.e., N-peroxyTBO+•, the C-centered peroxyTBO+• is favored, that upon dimerization (Russell mechanism) leads to dissociation of formaldehyde from the methylamine site.', 'TITLE: Toluidine blue O demethylated photoproducts as type II photosensitizers | KEYWORDS: photochemistry; photodemethylation; photophysics; photosensitizer; singlet oxygen; toluidine blue O | ABSTRACT: Toluidine blue O (TBO) is a type I–type II photosensitizer that has shown good efficacy and selectivity in antimicrobial and anticancer photodynamic therapy applications. However, its complex photochemistry with multiple photoproducts hinders its application as a photosensitizer.

The effect of the changes of the chemical composition on the mechanical properties was investigated. Hemicelluloses, cellulose, lignin, extractives, acetic acid, formic acid, total phenols and the cellulose degree of polymerization (DP) as well as modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) were measured for each modification. The results indicated that the closed system modification, particularly at high pressure, presented stronger variations on the chemical structure of the modified wood than the modifications in the open system. In both modifications, MOR showed a better correlation with the chemical changes than the MOE, especially xylose, cellulose DP, lignin and total phenols. These correlations suggest a tendency of a more brittle wood in the closed system modification at high pressure than in the modifications in the open system.

Currently, wood from thinning of young plantations of Nothofagus alpina (raulí) in Chile is being evaluated to obtain value before the plantation has reached maturity. The objective of this paper was to assess selected properties of thermally modified wood of young (14-to 25-years-old) N. alpina wood that comes from thinning of two sites with intensive silviculture and one similar to a secondary growth forest. To achieve this, non-destructive tests were carried out to measure some chemical-crystalline characteristics, as well as physical and mechanical properties; the differences between the 25%, 50%, and 75% distance from pith to the bark in each site was studied. The modification temperatures used were 170, 190, and 210 °C. The results show that thinning wood from N. alpina can be thermally modified with favorable results, thus presenting an option to obtain value while the plantation reaches maturity, particularly the thinning wood from the intensive forestry regimes, which presented most homogeneous results, especially at the modification temperature of 190 °C.', 'TITLE: Microstructure of Thermally Modified Radiata Pine Wood | KEYWORDS: Cell wall thickness; Heat treatment; Juvenile wood; Lumen diameter; Thermal modification; Wood anatomy | ABSTRACT: The thermal modification of wood is a potential alternative method for improving wood dimensional stability and increasing the resistance of wood to decay. However, during thermal modification, morphological changes occur within the microstructure of the cell, and these confer different properties to the wood. This study investigated the effects of the thermal modification process on the microstructure of radiata pine juvenile wood. Therefore, anatomical measurements were performed via optical microscopy in selected earlywood and latewood samples after each treatment, and the results were compared to untreated wood samples. In this study, two temperatures (190 °C and 210 °C) were considered for the thermal modification process. The results showed that the level of temperature of modification affected to microstructure of cell wall. The cell wall thickness decreased as treatment temperature increased, whereas the average lumen diameter increased slightly as temperature increased. Thermally modified radiata pine showed signs of damage (cracks, broken cells and deformations in the wood cell wall). The proportion of destroyed area increased as temperature increased, and significant differences were evident for the thermal treatment at 210 °C.']"

Enface and spectral-domain optical coherence tomographySD-OCT were analyzed at the time of presentation and at 1-month visit following initiation of treatment. The study patient underwent standard treatment for neurosyphilis. Results: Ophthalmic examination and imaging studies were consistent with the diagnosis of ASPPC. The patient age was 33 year-old and the baseline visual acuity was 20/400 and 20/80 in the right and left eyes, respectively. At presentation, SD-OCT scans showed disruption and loss of the ellipsoid zone (EZ), small nodular elevations on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and punctate hyperreflectivity in the choroid. Enface OCT at the level of RPE and EZ demonstrated multiple hyperreflective dot-like lesions simmetrically distributed within the macular area. These dot-like lesions corresponded to the small nodular elevations on RPE and to disruption/loss of EZ observed with SD-OCT.

Observations: Case report. Both the 64-year-old and 71-year-old females presented for a routine evaluation, and multimodal imaging analysis, including color fundus photography, indocyanine green angiography (ICG), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCTA, was performed to diagnose a MCM. En-face OCT, en-face OCTA and decorrelation signals were analyzed through the MCM. In both reported cases, color fundus photograph revealed a serpiginoid lesion in the temporal macula. Red-free imaging enhanced the appearance of this lesion resembling a dilated choroidal vessel. Cross-sectional OCT showed an enlarged choroidal vessel causing elevation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) within the fovea. En-face OCTA with segmentation below the choriocapillaris enhanced the MCM delineation. En-face OCT with segmentation below the choriocapillaris showed MCM with a greater distinctness than the en-face OCTA imaging. Decorrelation signals were not observed within MCM on cross-sectional OCTA. Conclusion and importance: En-face OCT and decorrelation signals on OCTA may have diagnostic value in distinguishing macular choroidal macrovessel from other choroidal vascular diseases.']"

However, the limitations of simple halo occupation models (HODs) preclude a full use of small-scale galaxy clustering data and call for more sophisticated models. We study two galaxy populations, luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and star-forming emission-line galaxies (ELGs), at two epochs, z = 1 and z = 0, in the large-volume, high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of the MillenniumTNG project. In a partner study we concentrated on the small-scale, one-halo regime down to r ∼0.1 h-1 Mpc, while here we focus on modelling galaxy assembly bias in the two-halo regime, r ∼ 1 h-1 Mpc. Interestingly, the ELG signal exhibits scale dependence out to relatively large scales (r ∼20 h-1 Mpc), implying that the linear bias approximation for this tracer is invalid on these scales, contrary to common assumptions. The 10-15 per cent discrepancy is only reconciled when we augment our halo occupation model with a dependence on extrinsic halo properties ('shear' being the best-performing one) rather than intrinsic ones (e.g. concentration, peak mass). We argue that this fact constitutes evidence for two-halo galaxy conformity. Including tertiary assembly bias (i.e. a property beyond mass and 'shear') is not an essential requirement for reconciling the galaxy assembly bias signal of LRGs, but the combination of external and internal properties is beneficial for recovering ELG the clustering. We find that centrals in low-mass haloes dominate the assembly bias signal of both populations. Finally, we explore the predictions of our model for higher order statistics such as nearest neighbour counts. The latter supplies additional information about galaxy assembly bias and can be used to break degeneracies between halo model parameters."", 'TITLE: The evolution of assembly bias | KEYWORDS: Evolution - galaxies; Formation - galaxies; Galaxies; Haloes - galaxies; Statistics - large-scale structure of universe - cosmology; Theory | ABSTRACT: We examine the evolution of assembly bias using a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation implemented in the Millennium-WMAP7 N-body simulation. We consider fixed number density galaxy samples ranked by stellar mass or star formation rate. We investigate how the clustering of haloes and their galaxy content depend on halo formation time and concentration, and how these relationships evolve with redshift. At z = 0 the dependences of halo clustering on halo concentration and formation time are similar. At higher redshift, halo assembly bias weakens for haloes selected by age, and reverses and increases for haloes selected by concentration, consistent with previous studies. The variation of the halo occupation with concentration and formation time is also similar at z = 0 and changes at higher redshifts. Here, the occupancy variation with halo age stays mostly constant with redshift but decreases for concentration. Finally, we look at the evolution of assembly bias reflected in the galaxy distribution by examining the galaxy correlation functions relative to those of shuffled galaxy samples that remove the occupancy variation. This correlation functions ratio monotonically decreases with larger redshift and for lower number density samples, going belowunity in some cases, leading to reduced galaxy clustering. While the halo occupation functions themselves vary, the assembly bias trends are similar whether selecting galaxies by stellar mass or star formation rate. Our results provide further insight into the origin and evolution of assembly bias. Our extensive occupation function measurements and fits are publicly available and can be used to create realistic mock catalogues.', 'TITLE: Predicting halo occupation and galaxy assembly bias with machine learning | KEYWORDS: cosmology: theory; dark matter; galaxies: formation; galaxies: haloes; galaxies: statistics; large-scale structure of Universe | ABSTRACT: Understanding the impact of halo properties beyond halo mass on the clustering of galaxies (namely galaxy assembly bias) remains a challenge for contemporary models of galaxy clustering. We explore the use of machine learning to predict the halo occupations and recover galaxy clustering and assembly bias in a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. For stellar mass selected samples, we train a random forest algorithm on the number of central and satellite galaxies in each dark matter halo. With the predicted occupations, we create mock galaxy catalogues and measure the clustering and assembly bias. Using a range of halo and environment properties, we find that the machine learning predictions of the occupancy variations with secondary properties, galaxy clustering, and assembly bias are all in excellent agreement with those of our target galaxy formation model. Internal halo properties are most important for the central galaxies prediction, while environment plays a critical role for the satellites. Our machine learning models are all provided in a usable format. We demonstrate that machine learning is a powerful tool for modelling the galaxy-halo connection, and can be used to create realistic mock galaxy catalogues which accurately recover the expected occupancy variations, galaxy clustering, and galaxy assembly bias, imperative for cosmological analyses of upcoming surveys.']"

The study utilizes eleven interviews with RTL Nieuws editorial members to gain insight into the influence of Smartocto, a tool for audience metrics, on the news production process. Through qualitative analysis, the experiences and perceptions of the journalists are analyzed. The interviews reveal that Smartocto does have an impact on the news production process of RTL Nieuws. The audience metrics provide journalists with insights into the preferences of the audience and can be used as a basis for editorial decisions. However, despite this influence, journalists retain their autonomy and have the freedom to make their own journalistic judgments. This research contributes to the understanding of the impact of audience metrics on the editorial autonomy of journalists.

While AI complicates and challenges some existing professional, social, political, and economic structures, it also offers new ways to realize desired journalistic objectives that were previously considered to be impractical, if not impossible. Drawing on four orienting ideas—adoption and hype, power and dependency, audiences and democratic implications, and education and empowerment—we unpack the implications of this AI turn in journalism and the consequences for the future of the journalistic field.', 'TITLE: Adapting to Twitter: The Entanglement of Journalistic Values and Online Personas | KEYWORDS: journalistic values; Kosovo; online personas; political journalism; social media; Twitter | ABSTRACT: As more journalists rely on social media platforms like Twitter to gather information and report the news, scholars have identified an increasing tension between traditional journalistic values and reporters’ construction of online personas. Moreover, networked journalists build these mediated personas—following platforms’ affordances—to better engage with fellow journalists and algorithmic audiences. Drawing on data from 15 in-depth interviews with Kosovar Albanian political journalists and editors, this article offers a unique perspective by examining the negotiation process between professional standards and journalists’ online personas on Twitter. Via their online personas, influenced by the audience and the platforms’ affordances and logic, journalists and editors have given rise to new role conceptions and standards in local political journalism. The results show that political journalists and editors in Kosovo view Twitter as a platform where they can display both professional and personal layers of their identity. Furthermore, they feel unrestricted by journalistic standards, taking on roles outside the traditional scope of journalism: as good citizens, they express opinions on political issues; as activists, they advocate for personally meaningful causes; but they also see themselves as mordant critics of political figures.']"

Material and methods: Prospective study that included 55 patients who underwent advance endoscopic skull base surgery. All patients were evaluated with MRI before, 3 months and 12 months after surgery. We used the Lund-Mackay staging system for chronic rhinosinusitis to evaluate the paranasal cavities and the sinonasal scoring system to assess sinonasal symptoms. Results: Seventeen patients (30.9%) underwent extended endonasal approach that required a nasoseptal flap (NSF) for reconstruction of skull base. At baseline the mean total Lund-Mackay score was 0.63 ± 1.2 (range 0-4), and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively the mean scores were 3.5 ± 3.8 (range 0-14) and 2.0 ± 2.5 (range 0-8) respectively. Patients who needed an NSF for reconstruction had a greater Lund-Mackay score (p < 0.05). Moreover, NSF is correlated with sinonasal mucosal thickening and fluid retention at 3 months (r = 0.45, p < 0.01) and 12 months (r = 0.4, p < 0.01). Total 5-symptom score (T5SS) was similar between both groups at baseline. Patients with extended endoscopic approach reported more smell loss (40.1 ± 26.2; p < 0.05) and posterior nasal discharge (49.3 ± 30.1; p < 0.05) than TTEA patients (21.6 ± 30.9 and 22.5 ± 27.5 respectively).

However, trauma, inflammation, infections, neoplasms, or abuse of inhaled drugs can also cause SP. Septal repair is indicated in patients who experience nasal obstruction, crusting, intermittent epistaxis, purulent discharge, or nasal whistling and in those who fail conservative treatment. Multiple approaches have been suggested to repair the SP; however, none has been universally adopted. This study explores the feasibility of repairing a total SP using the pericranial flap (PCF). Study Design: Anatomical cadaver and radiological study plus case study. Methods: Total nasal septectomy and endoscopic reconstruction with a PCF was performed in 12 injected cadaveric specimens. Maximum length and area of the nasal septum and the PCF were measured in 75 computed tomography scans. Based on the anatomical study and the radiological measurements of the cadavers, one patient underwent total nasal septum repair. Results: Anatomic measurements showed that the nasal septum has a mean length of 5.8 ± 0.7 cm, whereas the PCF was on average 18.4 ± 1.3 cm long (mean surface area 121.6 ± 17.7 cm2). Radiological measurements revealed that the PCF should provide a surface area of 40.9 ± 4.2 cm2 to account for the total septal area and an additional 30% to account range for potential scar retraction. For total septum repair, the distal edge of the PCF had to be placed 0.8 ± 2.0 cm (3.4 ± 8.7°) from the adopted reference point (vertical projection of the external ear canal). Total septal reconstruction was performed successfully in one patient without complications. Conclusions: Radio-anatomical data and a case study demonstrate that a PCF allows complete endoscopic repair of the nasal septum. Level of Evidence: NA.

Even though several studies have defined various surgical routes with tolerable morbidity and mortality rates, controversies related to the optimal avenue to treat different categories of Meckel's cave and cavernous sinus neoplasms persist. With unceasing energy to cultivate minimally invasive neurosurgical approaches, the endoscopic endonasal route has been tested, and the approach effectively performed, to provide a valid surgical window to these areas. In this dynamic and challenging scenario, another ventral endoscopic minimally invasive route-that is, the superior eyelid endoscopic transorbital approach-has been very recently proposed, and used in selected cases, to access the cavernous sinus and Meckel's cave regions. METHODS The authors report the technical nuances of a combined and simultaneous endoscopic endonasal and transorbital surgical treatment of a patient with a Meckel's cave schwannoma. The operation involved collaboration among neurosurgery, otorhinolaryngology, and ophthalmology (oculoplastic surgery). The patient recovered well, had no neurological deficits, and was discharged to home 3 days after surgery. RESULTS The multiportal combined route was proposed for the following reasons. The endonasal approach, considered to be more familiar to our skull base team, could allow control of possible damage of the internal carotid artery. From the endonasal perspective, the most inferior and medial portion of the tumor could be properly managed. Finally, the transorbital route, by means of opening the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus via the meningoorbital band, could allow control of the superolateral part of the tumor and, most importantly, could permit removal of the portion entering the posterior cranial fossa via the trigeminal pore. Simultaneous surgery with two surgical teams working together was planned in order to reduce operative time, hospital stay, and patient stress and discomfort, and to ensure “one-shot” complete tumor removal, with minimal or no complications. CONCLUSIONS This study represents the translation into the real surgical setting of recent anatomical contributions related to the novel endoscopic transorbital approach and its simultaneous integration with the endoscopic endonasal pathway. Accordingly, it may pave the way for future applications related to minimally invasive, multiportal endoscopic surgery for skull base tumors.""]"

However, to our knowledge, there is little information about their impacts on the volatile composition of wine. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of the application of several nitrogen sources in Tempranillo vineyards on wine volatile composition during the first season. Subsequently, two dosages of phenylalanine and urea were applied to the vineyard with the aim of evaluating their effect on wine volatile composition. The results show that the different nitrogen sources applied to the grapevines during the first season did not affect higher alcohols, fatty acids, esters and other volatile compounds in the wines. The two dosages of phenylalanine and urea applied to the vineyard during the second vintage barely affected wine volatile composition. Consequently, this study shows that foliar nitrogen treatments in vineyards did not modify the wine aromatic profile.', 'TITLE: Foliar application of methyl jasmonate to Graciano and Tempranillo vines: Effects on grape amino acid content during two consecutive vintages | KEYWORDS: Amino acids; effect; Elicitors; Grapevines; Methyl jasmonate; V.; Vintage | ABSTRACT: Aim: The study of elicitors in grapevines has focused on inducing resistance to diseases and improving phenolic and volatile composition of grapes and wines. Due to the importance of nitrogen compounds in grape quality, the aim of this work was to study the effect of methyl jasmonate (MeJ) applied to two grapevine varieties on grape amino acid content during two consecutive seasons. Methods and results: Amino acids were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. The results showed that MeJ applications to Tempranillo grapevines decreased the concentration of certain amino acids during both seasons, but did not affect total amino acid content. Moreover, MeJ applications to Graciano grapevines increased the concentration of several amino acids during the second season.

Thus the aim of this research was to study the effect of foliar elicitor treatments, methyl jasmonate (MeJ) and yeast extract (YE), and foliar nitrogen applications, urea (Ur) and phenylalanine (Phe), to Garnacha, Graciano and Tempranillo vines on grape amino acid composition. RESULTS: The results showed that elicitor and nitrogen foliar applications to Garnacha and Tempranillo grapevines decreased the must amino acid concentration. However, Phe application to these two grapevines increased the must Phe content. The treatments applied to Graciano grapevines barely effected the grape amino acid content. According to the percentage of variance attributable, the variety had a higher impact on the must amino acid composition than the treatments and their interaction, except in certain amino acids such as Phe. CONCLUSION: The influence of elicitor and nitrogen foliar applications to grapevines on grape amino acid concentration was strongly conditioned by the variety. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.']"

With suitable types of Ansätze, one can construct infinite-dimensional families of analytic solutions with nonvanishing topological charges (representing the baryonic number) labeled by both two integer numbers and by free scalar fields in (1+1) dimensions. These exact configurations represent (3+1)-dimensional topological solitons hosting (1+1)-dimensional chiral modes localized at the energy density peaks. First, we analyze the Yang-Mills-Higgs model, in which the fields depend on all the space-time coordinates (to keep alive the topological Chern-Simons charge), but in such a way to reduce the equations system to the field equations of two-dimensional free massless chiral scalar fields. Then, we move to the nonlinear sigma model, showing that a suitable Ansatz reduces the field equations to the one of a two-dimensional free massless scalar field. Then, we discuss the Skyrme model concluding that the inclusion of the Skyrme term gives rise to a chiral two-dimensional free massless scalar field (instead of a free massless field in two dimensions as in the nonlinear sigma model) describing analytically spatially modulated hadronic layers and tubes. The comparison of the present approach both with the instanton-dyon liquid approach and with lattice QCD is shortly outlined.', 'TITLE: Analytic topologically nontrivial solutions of the (3+1)-dimensional U (1) gauged Skyrme model and extended duality | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: We construct the first analytic examples of topologically nontrivial solutions of the (3+1)-dimensional U(1) gauged Skyrme model within a finite box in (3+1)-dimensional flat space-time.

The approach used a reduced number of pressure tap data located close to the blade leading edge. The results were compared with the measurements from three external probes mounted on the blade at different radial positions and with analytical calculations. Both experimental approaches used in this study are based on the 2-D flow assumption; the pressure tap method is an application of the thin airfoil theory, while the probe method applies geometrical and induction corrections to the measurement data. The experiments were conducted in the wind tunnel at the Hermann Föttinger Institut of the Technische Universität Berlin. The research turbine is a three-bladed upwind horizontal axis wind turbine model with a rotor diameter of 3 m. The measurements were carried out at rated conditions with a tip speed ratio of 4.35 and different yaw and pitch angles were tested in order to compare the approaches over a wide range of conditions. Results show that the pressure tap method is suitable and provides a similar angle of attack to the external probe measurements as well as the analytical calculations. This is a significant step for the experimental determination of the local angle of attack, as it eliminates the need for external probes, which affect the flow over the blade and require additional calibration.', 'TITLE: Rotational and blockage effects on a wind turbine model based on local blade forces | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This paper describes the results of an extended experimental campaign, reporting surface pressure measurement over one of the blades of the Berlin Research Turbine (BeRT), placed in a closed-loop wind tunnel facility. BeRT is a three-bladed horizontal axis wind turbine with a 3m rotor diameter. The focus is, on the one side, on the three-dimensional effects experienced by the rotating blade, in comparison to 2D approaches by means of XFoil simulations and 2D blade section experiments. On the other side, the blockage effects are investigated between the wind turbine model, placed in the wind tunnel where a 40% blockage ratio is produced, and lifting line free vortex wake simulations, where wind tunnel walls are not considered. Additionally, CFD computations are added in the comparison, with simulations of the far-field and with the wind tunnel walls. The turbine model is studied at several operational conditions such as different blade pitch angles and turbine yaw misalignments. Results are presented in terms of local force components derived from the surface pressure measurements. It is shown that rotational augmentation is evident at the blade mid-span location despite the large blockage. Additionally, the blockage is noticed by means of an offset in both normal and tangential local forces conserving trends and features under axial inflow and yaw misalignments. It is found that the offset in forces can be counteracted by pitching the blades.', 'TITLE: OC6 project Phase III: validation of the aerodynamic loading on a wind turbine rotor undergoing large motion caused by a floating support structure | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: This paper provides a summary of the work done within Phase III of the Offshore Code Comparison Collaboration, Continued, with Correlation and unCertainty (OC6) project, under the International Energy Agency Wind Technology Collaboration Programme Task 30. This phase focused on validating the aerodynamic loading on a wind turbine rotor undergoing large motion caused by a floating support structure. Numerical models of the Technical University of Denmark 10 MW reference wind turbine were validated using measurement data from a 1:75 scale test performed during the UNsteady Aerodynamics for FLOating Wind (UNAFLOW) project and a follow-on experimental campaign, both performed at the Politecnico di Milano wind tunnel. Validation of the models was performed by comparing the loads for steady (fixed platform) and unsteady (harmonic motion of the platform) wind conditions. For the unsteady wind conditions, the platform was forced to oscillate in the surge and pitch directions under several frequencies and amplitudes. These oscillations result in a wind variation that impacts the rotor loads (e.g., thrust and torque). For the conditions studied in these tests, the system aerodynamic response was almost steady. Only a small hysteresis in airfoil performance undergoing angle of attack variations in attached flow was observed. During the experiments, the rotor speed and blade pitch angle were held constant. However, in real wind turbine operating conditions, the surge and pitch variations would result in rotor speed variations and/or blade pitch actuations, depending on the wind turbine controller region that the system is operating. Additional simulations with these control parameters were conducted to verify the fidelity of different models. Participant results showed, in general, a good agreement with the experimental measurements and the need to account for dynamic inflow when there are changes in the flow conditions due to the rotor speed variations or blade pitch actuations in response to surge and pitch motion. Numerical models not accounting for dynamic inflow effects predicted rotor loads that were 9% lower in amplitude during rotor speed variations and 18% higher in amplitude during blade pitch actuations.']"

Two types of hydatid cysts occur in intermediate hosts: fertile cysts that generate protoscoleces from the germinal layer of the cyst, and infertile cysts that do not produce protoscoleces and are unable to continue the life cycle of the parasite. The adventitial layer, a host-derived fibrous capsule surrounding the hydatid cyst, is suggested to play an important role in local immune regulation during infection and in fertility of the cysts. Fasciola hepatica, another important parasite of cattle, induces a characteristic Th2-like immune response that could modulate the immune response against E. granulosus. Natural co-infection of both parasites is common in cattle, but no reports describe the local immune response against E. granulosus with F. hepatica infection in the same host. This study analyzed the number and distribution of T and B cells in the adventitial layer of liver and lung cysts and the relationship with cyst fertility and F. hepatica co-infection. T lymphocytes were the predominant cell type in the adventitial layer of infertile hydatid cysts and were more numerous in infertile hydatid cysts. B lymphocyte numbers were not associated with hydatid cyst fertility. Mast cells were infrequent in the adventitial layer. The number of T and B cells was not associated with F. hepatica co-infection. The present study contributes to the understanding of local immune responses in bovine cystic echinococcosis.', 'TITLE: Transcriptome analysis of Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto protoscoleces reveals differences in immune modulation gene expression between cysts found in cattle and sheep | KEYWORDS: cattle; Cystic echinococcosis; immune modulation; protoscolex; RNAseq; sheep; transcriptomics | ABSTRACT: Cystic Echinococcosis (CE), a zoonotic parasitic disease, is caused by the cestode Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato.

Agreement systems suppose that at least two words share some features with each other, such as gender, number, or case. Previous work, within the multi-agent language-game framework, has recently proposed models stressing the hypothesis that the emergence of a grammatical agreement system arises from the minimization of semantic ambiguity. On the other hand, neurobiological evidence argues for the hypothesis that language evolution has mainly related to an increasing of short-term memory capacity, which has allowed the online manipulation of words and meanings participating particularly in grammatical agreement systems. Here, the main aim is to propose a multi-agent language game for the emergence of a grammatical agreement system, under measurable long-range relations depending on the short-term memory capacity. Computer simulations, based on a parameter that measures the amount of short-term memory capacity, suggest that agreement marker systems arise in a population of agents equipped at least with a critical short-term memory capacity.', 'TITLE: Multilingual two-digit number naming: The influence of composition rules on language switching | KEYWORDS: Language switching; linguistic number format; number processing; switch cost | ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to examine language switching in a two-digit number naming task. In contrast to single digits, two-digit numbers have a composition rule (i.e., morphological configuration) that may differ between languages. For example, the Arabic number 21 is read with an inverted composition rule in German (unit before decade) and a non-inverted composition rule in English (decade before unit). In the present experiment, one group of German native speakers and one group of Spanish native speakers had to name two-digit numbers in German, English, or Spanish. The results demonstrate a language-switch cost, revealing better performance in language repetition than in language-switch trials. This switch cost was further modulated by repeating or switching the composition rule, since the language repetition benefit (i.e., the switch cost) was reduced in trials with composition-rule switches compared with trials with composition-rule repetitions. This finding indicates that the language in which the number word has to be produced and its composition rule are not switched independently but rather may be integrated into one language schema.', 'TITLE: Interplay of Morphological Configuration and Language Switching in Numerical Processing and Word Processing | KEYWORDS: Language processing; Language switching; Morphological configuration; Morphological configuration switching; Switch cost | ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study was to examine the interplay of morphological configuration switching and language switching. The morphological configuration is present in word-formation whenever a word contains more than one free morpheme. The morphological configuration is variable both within and between languages for example in two-digit number names (is the decade named first as in twenty-one or the unit named first as in seventeen) and in compound words (is the modifier or the head named first). In the present experiments, participants had to switch between morphological configurations and between languages (German, English, and Spanish). Language-switch cost was measured as the performance difference between language-switch trials and language-repetition trials. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants performed language-comprehension tasks on two-digit numbers and a language-production task on compound words in Experiment 3. All three experiments revealed an under-additive switch cost pattern in which a larger language-switch cost occurred in morphological configuration-repetition trials than in morphological configuration-switch trials. Thus, the present data indicate integration of the morphological configuration and language into one language-related schema—irrespective of the language task (comprehension vs. production) and the type of stimuli (number words vs. compound nouns)']"

The inhibitory activity of the compounds was determined by Ca2+ influx assays on cells expressing either the hα7 or hα4β2 nAChR subtype. To determine whether the observed inhibitory activity is mediated by a competitive or non-competitive mechanism, additional radioligand binding assays were performed using [3H] methyllycaconitine, [3H]cytisine, and [3H]imipramine. The results established that the compounds inhibit the nAChRs by a competitive mechanism and that the potencies are higher for the hα7 nAChR compared to that for the hα4β2 nAChR. Substitutions with oxygenated functional groups on the benzene ring increase the receptor selectivity. In particular, the hydroxyl derivatives 4b and 4c present the highest selectivity for the hα7 nAChR subtype. Molecular docking results indicate that the hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group at α7-Gln116, but not at β2-Phe115, supporting the observed receptor selectivity at the molecular level. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.', 'TITLE: Neonicotinic analogues: Selective antagonists for α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors | KEYWORDS: Antagonism; Functional and affinities; Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; Structure-activity relationships | ABSTRACT: Nicotine is an agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that has been extensively used as a template for the synthesis of α4β2-preferring nAChRs.

This gap in knowledge is more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the documented increase in family responsibilities in detriment of work performance, particularly for women. Job satisfaction has been identified as a mediator between the family and work domains for the individual, but these family-to-work dynamics remain unexplored at a dyadic level during the pandemic. Therefore, this study tested the relationship between family-to-work conflict and job and family satisfaction, and the mediating role of job satisfaction between family-to-work conflict and family satisfaction, in dual-earner parents. A non-probability sample of 430 dual-earner parents with adolescent children were recruited in Rancagua, Chile. Mothers and fathers answered an online questionnaire with a measure of family-to-work conflict, the Job Satisfaction Scale and Satisfaction with Family Life Scale. Data was analysed using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model with structural equation modelling. Results showed that, for individuals, a higher family-to-work conflict is linked to lower satisfaction with both their job and family life, and these two types of satisfaction are positively associated with one another. Both parents experience a double negative effect on their family life satisfaction, due to their own, and to their partner’s family-to-work conflict; however, for fathers, this effect from their partner occurs via their own job satisfaction. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed, indicating the need of family-oriented workplace policies with a gender perspective to increase satisfaction in the family domain for workers and their families.', 'TITLE: Influence of Workplace Support for Families and Family Support on Family-to-Work-Conflict and Family Satisfaction in Dual-Earner Parents with Adolescents during the Pandemic | KEYWORDS: Actor-partner interdependence model; Adolescents; Conflict; Dual-earner parents; Family satisfaction; Support | ABSTRACT: Organizational and family support may be invested to reduce workers’ family-to-work conflict and increase their and their family members’ family satisfaction.

Hence, ameliorating the effects of ageing may prevent multiple diseases simultaneously. Drugs licensed for human use against specific diseases have proved to be effective in extending lifespan and healthspan in animal models, suggesting that there is scope for drug repurposing in humans. New bioinformatic methods to identify and prioritise potential anti-ageing compounds for humans are therefore of interest. In this study, we first used drug-protein interaction information, to rank 1,147 drugs by their likelihood of targeting ageing-related gene products in humans. Among 19 statistically significant drugs, 6 have already been shown to have pro-longevity properties in animal models (p < 0.001). Using the targets of each drug, we established their association with ageing at multiple levels of biological action including pathways, functions and protein interactions. Finally, combining all the data, we calculated a ranked list of drugs that identified tanespimycin, an inhibitor of HSP-90, as the top-ranked novel anti-ageing candidate.

This process began with substituting S atoms with CH− units, then replacing three sequential protons with two Si2+ units in the resultant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon polyanion. Despite not representing the global minimum, the newly designed Si8C22 system with four ptCs provided valuable insights into strategic design and potential energy surface exploration.

Here we show that ptC persists in some clusters with an equivalent number of C and Si atoms, i.e., Si5 C5, Si8 C8, and Si9 C9 . In all these species, the ptC is embedded in a pentagonal C5 ring and participates in a three-center, two-electron (3c-2e) Si-ptC-Si σ-bond.

This strategy that maximizes both mechanical and electronic effects through aromatic architectures can be extended to several molecular combinations to achieve new and diverse compounds containing planar hypercoordinate carbon centers.']"

In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n= 30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56 ± 0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47 ± 0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82 ± 2.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific, whereas the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n= 50 states, we adopted the disease-specific values from China and found a contact period of 3.38 ± 0.69 days. Our network model predicts that—without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today—the United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 ± 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lockdown, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.', 'TITLE: Visualizing the invisible: The effect of asymptomatic transmission on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 | KEYWORDS: Asymptomatic transmission; Bayesian inference; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Machine learning; Uncertainty quantification | ABSTRACT: Understanding the outbreak dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic has important implications for successful containment and mitigation strategies. Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model computes, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study quantifies the sensitivity of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups. For nine distinct locations, our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by Jun 15, 2020 to 24.15% (95% CI: 20.48%-28.14%) for Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), 2.40% (95% CI: 2.09%-2.76%) for Ada County (ID, USA), 46.19% (95% CI: 45.81%-46.60%) for New York City (NY, USA), 11.26% (95% CI: 7.21%-16.03%) for Santa Clara County (CA, USA), 3.09% (95% CI: 2.27%-4.03%) for Denmark, 12.35% (95% CI: 10.03%-15.18%) for Geneva Canton (Switzerland), 5.24% (95% CI: 4.84%-5.70%) for the Netherlands, 1.53% (95% CI: 0.76%-2.62%) for Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and 5.32% (95% CI: 4.77%-5.93%) for Belgium. Our method traces the initial outbreak date in Santa Clara County back to January 20, 2020 (95% CI: December 29, 2019–February 13, 2020). Our results could significantly change our understanding and management of the COVID-19 pandemic: A large asymptomatic population will make isolation, containment, and tracing of individual cases challenging. Instead, managing community transmission through increasing population awareness, promoting physical distancing, and encouraging behavioral changes could become more relevant.', 'TITLE: Outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in Europe and the effect of travel restrictions | KEYWORDS: Coronavirus; COVID-19; epidemiology; outbreak control; outbreak dynamics; SEIR model | ABSTRACT: For the first time in history, on March 17, 2020, the European Union closed all its external borders in an attempt to contain the spreading of the coronavirus 2019, COVID-19. Throughout two past months, governments around the world have implemented massive travel restrictions and border control to mitigate the outbreak of this global pandemic. However, the precise effects of travel restrictions on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 remain unknown. Here we combine a global network mobility model with a local epidemiology model to simulate and predict the outbreak dynamics and outbreak control of COVID-19 across Europe. We correlate our mobility model to passenger air travel statistics and calibrate our epidemiology model using the number of reported COVID-19 cases for each country. Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak. Our results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID-19, especially in Central Europe, Spain, and France. Ultimately, our network epidemiology model can inform political decision making and help identify exit strategies from current travel restrictions and total lockdown.']"

The proposed EMS comprises a two-level hierarchical control structure, with local controllers at microgrid level, and a supervisory control at the main-grid level. The main contribution of the proposed EMS is that it uses model-based predictive controllers (MPC) and DSM at both levels of the hierarchy. The main-grid level minimizes the imported power from the main grid and the shift from the expected demand for each microgrid. Moreover, it computes optimal aggregated power and demand side management references for each microgrid. The microgrid level manages the energy resources of each microgrid based on the reference signals sent by the main-grid level. Thus, the microgrid level tracks the main-grid level references, while minimizing both the power variation in the battery energy storage system and the variation in shifting factor to manage the demand. A simulation of a multi-microgrid system with three microgrids is implemented to validate the performance of the proposed two-level hierarchical MPC-based EMS with DSM. The proposed control scheme uses fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno models to predict the generation and consumption of the microgrids at both control levels. Furthermore, the proposed configuration is compared with two conventional EMS from the literature. The proposed architecture outperforms previously proposed controllers since, in the considered simulations, it (i) reduces to at least 1/4 the loss-of-power-supply probability for each individual microgrid, (ii) halfs the cycling of the individual storage devices in each microgrid, and (iii) reduces the overall system cost in ∼1.5%.']"

Therefore, at high levels of VRE penetration, it is crucial to accurately represent frequency stability constraints in power system operation and planning. This paper presents a two-stage methodology to assess the impact of frequency stability constraints in the generation expansion planning (GEP) model, focusing on VRE integration and the dynamic performance of power systems. The first stage involves the GEP model determining the optimal new generation capacity mix, considering linearized frequency stability constraints. The second stage assesses the GEP results' dynamic performance by simulating power system transients using DIgSILENT PowerFactory.

Therefore, at high levels of VRE penetration, it is crucial to accurately represent frequency stability constraints in power system operation and planning. This paper presents a two-stage methodology to assess the impact of frequency stability constraints in the generation expansion planning (GEP) model, focusing on VRE integration and the dynamic performance of power systems. The first stage involves the GEP model determining the optimal new generation capacity mix, considering linearized frequency stability constraints. The second stage assesses the GEP results' dynamic performance by simulating power system transients using DIgSILENT PowerFactory. To quantify the impact of frequency stability constraints, we consider three security indices: initial rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), frequency nadir, and steady-state frequency deviation. Finally, we analyze two case studies: the GEP model with and without considering frequency constraints on an illustrative 13-bus test system.

The model allows to accurately quantify the value of flexibility options in renewable power systems by representing short-term operation through the unit commitment constraints. Long-term uncertainty is represented through a scenario tree. The resulting model is a large-scale multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problem. To overcome the computational burden, a distributed computing framework based on the novel Column Generation and Sharing algorithm is proposed. The performance improvement of the proposed approach is demonstrated through study cases applied to the NREL 118-bus power system. The results confirm the added value of modeling short-term constraints and long-term uncertainty simultaneously. The computational case studies show that the proposed solution approach clearly outperforms the state of the art in terms of computational performance and accuracy. The proposed planning framework is used to assess the value of energy storage systems in the transition to a low-carbon power system.']"

This work describes a density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent -DFT study at the PBE0/6-31 + G(d) level of theory to analyse the structural, electronic and photophysical properties of a series of new proposed 4′-amine-aurone derivatives in its E and Z isomeric conformations. The maximum absorption wavelength of the proposed aurones appears in the range 390 − 514 nm, while the most allowed emission pathways were computed in the range 493–530 nm. The bathochromic shift of these compounds with respect to the non-substituted aurone is modulated by the acceptor strength of the added 4-substituents, in addition to the ability of the substituents to localise the frontier molecular orbitals over the acceptor benzofuranone moiety without losing the tricyclic planarity, which favours the push–pull nature of these molecules. The influence of the 4-substituent is also evidenced in the Stokes shifts for the whole series; as the electron-withdrawing character of the 4-substituents enhances, higher is the polarisation of the structure resulting in higher Stokes shifts. As a result, -CF 3 and -NO 2 substituents were responsible of larger Stokes shifts, then compounds containing these substituents are proposed as potential fluorescence probes for useful applications in biological systems.', 'TITLE: Theoretical rationalisation of the photophysics of a TICT excited state of cinnamoyl-coumarin derivatives in homogeneous and biological membrane models | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: A new hybrid cinnamoyl-coumarin probe was synthesised to study the formation and dynamics of a twisted internal charge transfer (TICT) excited state in homogeneous and biological membrane models.

These galls are rich in secondary metabolites (SMs), which include phenolic compounds, terpenes, and other bioactive molecules. Phenolic compounds, particularly tannins, and flavonoids, are commonly found in galls and have been associated with defensive functions against herbivores and pathogens. Recent studies highlight their antioxidant functions, helping the plant cope with oxidative stress during gall formation. The distribution and concentration of these compounds can vary depending on factors such as the physiological status of the host plant, gall developmental stages, and the specific galling organism involved. Volatile compounds, including terpenoids, are also present in galls, influecing plant-insect interactions. Galling organisms can modify the profile and concentration of volatiles in their host plants, influencing the attraction of female insects and the selection of oviposition sites. Their impact on volatile emissions varies; some studies note decreases while others report increases. Besides ecological roles, humans use plant galls medicinally due to their polyphenol-rich content, valued for antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Edible galls, like those from certain fungi, are consumed in various cultures. Additionally, plant galls have been explored for their allelopathic potential, affecting the growth and development of neighboring plants. Understanding the chemical composition of galls and their impact on host plant properties provides valuable insights into plant defense mechanisms, ecological dynamics, and potential applications in human cultures.', 'TITLE: Spatiotemporal variation in phenolic levels in galls of calophyids on Schinus polygama (Anacardiaceae) | KEYWORDS: Calophyidae; Compartmentalization; Gall; Lignins; Polyphenols; Schinus polygama | ABSTRACT: The expression of plant secondary metabolism is strongly controlled by plant both in time and space. Although the variation of secondary metabolites, such as soluble and structural phenolics (e.g., lignins), has been largely observed in gall-inducing insects, and compared to their non-galled host organs, only a few datasets recording such variation are available. Accordingly, the relative importance of spatiotemporal variability in phenolic contents, and the influence of gall developmental stages on the original composition of host organs are poorly discussed. To address this knowledge gap, we histochemically determined the sites of polyphenol and lignin accumulation, and the polyphenol contents in three developmental stages of two calophyid galls and their correspondent host organs. Current results indicate that the compartmentalization of phenolics and lignins on Schinus polygama (Cav.) Cabrera follows a similar pattern in the two-calophyid galls, accumulating in the outer (the external tissue layers) and in the inner tissue compartments (the cell layers in contact with the gall chamber).

Distinct structures within the basal ganglia of the brain, an area involved in movement regulation, are differentially affected for every disease. Among the most studied movement disorder conditions are Parkinson’s (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD), in which the deregulation of the movement circuitry due to the loss of specific neuronal populations in basal ganglia is the underlying cause of motor symptoms. These symptoms are due to the loss principally of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) par compacta and the GABAergic neurons of the striatum in PD and HD, respectively. Although these diseases were described in the 19th century, no effective treatment can slow down, reverse, or stop disease progression. Available pharmacological therapies have been focused on preventing or alleviating motor symptoms to improve the quality of life of patients, but these drugs are not able to mitigate the progressive neurodegeneration. Currently, considerable therapeutic advances have been achieved seeking a more efficacious and durable therapeutic effect. Here, we will focus on the new advances of several therapeutic approaches for PD and HD, starting with the available pharmacological treatments to alleviate the motor symptoms in both diseases. Then, we describe therapeutic strategies that aim to restore specific neuronal populations or their activity. Among the discussed strategies, the use of Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) and genetic approaches to prevent the neuronal loss in these diseases will be described. We will highlight strategies that have been evaluated in both Parkinson’s and Huntington’s patients, and also the ones with strong preclinical evidence. These current therapeutic techniques represent the most promising tools for the safe treatment of both diseases, specifically those aimed to avoid neuronal loss during disease progression.', 'TITLE: IGF2 prevents dopaminergic neuronal loss and decreases intracellular alpha-synuclein accumulation in Parkinson’s disease models | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common late-onset neurodegenerative disease and the predominant cause of movement problems. PD is characterized by motor control impairment by extensive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). This selective dopaminergic neuronal loss is in part triggered by intracellular protein inclusions called Lewy bodies, which are composed mainly of misfolded alpha-synuclein (α-syn) protein. We previously reported insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) as a key protein downregulated in PD patients. Here we demonstrated that IGF2 treatment or IGF2 overexpression reduced the α-syn aggregates and their toxicity by IGF2 receptor (IGF2R) activation in cellular PD models. Also, we observed IGF2 and its interaction with IGF2R enhance the α-syn secretion. To determine the possible IGF2 neuroprotective effect in vivo we used a gene therapy approach in an idiopathic PD model based on α-syn preformed fibrils intracerebral injection. IGF2 gene therapy revealed a significantly preventing of motor impairment in idiopathic PD model. Moreover, IGF2 expression prevents dopaminergic neuronal loss in the SN together with a decrease in α-syn accumulation (phospho-α-syn levels) in the striatum and SN brain region. Furthermore, the IGF2 neuroprotective effect was associated with the prevention of synaptic spines loss in dopaminergic neurons in vivo. The possible mechanism of IGF2 in cell survival effect could be associated with the decrease of the intracellular accumulation of α-syn and the improvement of dopaminergic synaptic function.

Haemosporidian parasites can affect the reproductive output of wild birds in multiple ways. Thorn-tailed Rayaditos Aphrastura spinicauda breeding in Navarino Island, southern Chile (55°–40°S), experience a high prevalence of the haemosporidian Leucocytozoon spp., which opens the possibility of exploring how these parasites may affect reproductive output in a Neotropical bird species. We compared several variables describing reproductive output (laying date, clutch size, incubation period, brood size, nestling body condition and early-life telomere length) of infected and non-infected parents (individually and as breeding pairs). We found that infected females and breeding pairs with both parents infected showed significantly shorter incubation periods than un-infected Thorn-tailed Rayaditos. Furthermore, breeding pairs where both parents were infected raised nestlings with higher body condition than nestlings for which infection was present in only one or in neither of the parents. Our results suggest that the higher the parental investment, the higher the risk of relapse of chronic infection by Leucocytozoon spp. Thorn-tailed Rayaditos that decrease their incubation period pay the cost of infection to take advantage of early breeding through a greater availability of resources, producing nestlings with higher body condition.', 'TITLE: Risk-taking behaviour relates to timing of breeding in a sub-Antarctic rainforest bird | KEYWORDS: exploratory behaviour; reproductive success; southern Chile; start laying; Thorn-tailed Rayadito | ABSTRACT: Within-population variation in timing of breeding may be linked to a trade-off between the risks and benefits of breeding earlier. This trade-off may be mediated by individual risk-taking behaviour, but this needs to be assessed in detail in wild populations. Here, we recorded timing of breeding and risk-taking behaviour during three consecutive breeding seasons in a resident population of Thorn-tailed Rayadito Aphrastura spinicauda located in Navarino Island (55°S), southern Chile. Navarino is a high-latitude, highly seasonal continental island in southern Chile where early breeding may be risky for rayaditos, given the presence of low temperatures, storms and relatively low food abundance during early spring. We used novel environment tests to assess exploratory behaviour, which in turn was used as a proxy of risk-taking behaviour. In addition, we evaluated the potential consequences of timing of breeding and risk-taking behaviour on three measures of reproductive success: clutch size, number of fledglings produced and body condition of the offspring. We found that risk-prone individuals started breeding earlier than risk-averse individuals but we did not find evidence for an effect of timing of breeding on any of the variables of seasonal breeding success. However, we observed that fast-exploring females tended to lay smaller clutches. Measurements reflecting lifetime reproductive success may better reflect an effect of timing of breeding and risk-taking behaviour, but this needs to be studied. Our results support the idea that risk-taking behaviour is linked to early breeding in high-latitude environments. We suggest that, despite the risks that low temperatures and snowstorms pose to breeding rayaditos during early spring, it is possible that early breeders increase the probability of occupying better nesting cavities and they may adjust the timing of breeding to match brood provisioning with peak resource abundance.', 'TITLE: Sex-specific provisioning of nutritious food items in relation to brood sex ratios in a non-dimorphic bird | KEYWORDS: Aphrastura spinicauda; Avian nutrition; Bi-parental care; Thorn-tailed Rayadito | ABSTRACT: Abstract: In birds, the frequency with which the parents feed the young can vary considerably. Because of sexual differences in the begging behaviour and/or differences in the food requirements of the nestlings, brood sex ratio (BSR) is an important factor that may influence parental provisioning behaviour. Disparities in the quantity and quality of prey received by the sexes have been reported in a range of sexually size-dimorphic birds. However, to our knowledge, no study has evaluated prey composition delivery to nestlings in relation to BSR in a non-dimorphic size bird species. Because BSR influences provisioning rate in dimorphic and non-size dimorphic species and because in dimorphic species, BSR influences prey composition delivered to the nest, we hypothesised that similar to dimorphic species, BSR may influence prey composition delivered to nestlings in non-size dimorphic species. We quantify parental provisioning rate and prey composition of prey delivered to nestlings in relation to BSR in the Thorn-tailed Rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda) a non-dimorphic and altricial passerine bird. At the population level, we found that Thorn-tailed Rayadito mothers delivered more insect larvae to the nest when compared to the father, who provided the brood with a diet more diverse in composition. However, when we considered BSR, mothers delivered a greater quantity of arachnida and lepidoptera items (high-quality foods) in male-biased BSR. In addition, nestling weight gain increased in line with the proportion of high-quality food in the diet. Our results suggest that when considering non-dimorphic species, there may be more subtle, but nevertheless important, differences, in explaining parental care behaviour in species with bi-parental care. Significance statement: In birds, the frequency with which the parents feed the young can vary considerably. Because of sexual differences in the begging behaviour and/or differences in the food requirements of the nestlings, brood sex ratio is an important factor that may influence parental provisioning behaviour in sexual size species. For the first time, we evaluated prey composition delivery to nestlings in relation to BSR in a non-size dimorphic bird species. We found that the mother of the Thorn-tailed Rayadito delivered a greater quantity of lepidoptera and arachnida (high-quality food) items in a male-biased brood. In addition, nestling weight gain increased with the proportion of high-quality food in the diet.

Ten patients with moderate COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) = 68.6% ± 20.4% of predicted; 68.3 ± 9.1 years) performed 30 min of moderate-intensity concentric (CONC-M: 50% maximum workload; Wmax), moderate-intensity eccentric (ECC-M: 50% Wmax), and high-intensity eccentric (ECC-H: 100% Wmax) cycling. Average power output, oxygen consumption (V˙ O2), minute ventilation (VE), respiratory frequency (fR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and dyspnea were measured during cycling. Compared with CONC-M, lower V˙ O2 (–52% ± 14%), VE (–47% ± 16%), fR (–21% ± 14%), HR (–14% ± 16%), SBP (–73% ± 54%), RPE (–36% ± 26%), and dyspnea (–41% ± 37%) were found during ECC-M. During ECC-H, a similar metabolic demand to CONC-M was found. However, average power output was 117% ± 79% higher during ECC-H. Eccentric cycling can be safely performed by COPD patients and induced lower cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and perceptual responses than concentric exercise when performed at the same workload. Novelty • Moderate-and high-intensity eccentric cycling can be performed by COPD patients. • Moderate-intensity eccentric cycling showed lower cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and perceptual demand than concentric cycling at the same workload in COPD patients. • Even at double workload, eccentric cycling induces lower cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and perceptual demand than moderate-intensity concentric cycling.', 'TITLE: Progression of regional lung strain and heterogeneity in lung injury: assessing the evolution under spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation | KEYWORDS: Acute lung injury; Image-based biomechanical analysis; Lung heterogeneity; Lung strain; Mechanical ventilation; Spontaneous breathing | ABSTRACT: Background: Protective mechanical ventilation (MV) aims at limiting global lung deformation and has been associated with better clinical outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. In ARDS lungs without MV support, the mechanisms and evolution of lung tissue deformation remain understudied. In this work, we quantify the progression and heterogeneity of regional strain in injured lungs under spontaneous breathing and under MV. Methods: Lung injury was induced by lung lavage in murine subjects, followed by 3 h of spontaneous breathing (SB-group) or 3 h of low Vt mechanical ventilation (MV-group). Micro-CT images were acquired in all subjects at the beginning and at the end of the ventilation stage following induction of lung injury. Regional strain, strain progression and strain heterogeneity were computed from image-based biomechanical analysis. Three-dimensional regional strain maps were constructed, from which a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was performed for the regional strain, the strain progression, and the strain heterogeneity. Results: After 3 h of ventilation, regional strain levels were significantly higher in 43.7% of the ROIs in the SB-group. Significant increase in regional strain was found in 1.2% of the ROIs in the MV-group. Progression of regional strain was found in 100% of the ROIs in the SB-group, whereas the MV-group displayed strain progression in 1.2% of the ROIs. Progression in regional strain heterogeneity was found in 23.4% of the ROIs in the SB-group, while the MV-group resulted in 4.7% of the ROIs showing significant changes. Deformation progression is concurrent with an increase of non-aerated compartment in SB-group (from 13.3% ± 1.6% to 37.5% ± 3.1%), being higher in ventral regions of the lung. Conclusions: Spontaneous breathing in lung injury promotes regional strain and strain heterogeneity progression. In contrast, low Vt MV prevents regional strain and heterogeneity progression in injured lungs.', 'TITLE: Mapping regional strain in anesthetised healthy subjects during spontaneous ventilation | KEYWORDS: image-based biomechanical analysis; lung heterogeneity; lung physiology; lung strain; spontaneous breathing | ABSTRACT: Introduction Breathing produces a phenomenon of cyclic deformation throughout life. Biomechanically, deformation of the lung is measured as strain. Regional strain recently started to be recognised as a tool in the study of lung pathophysiology, but regional lung strain has not been studied in healthy subjects breathing spontaneously without voluntary or pharmacological control of ventilation. Our aim is to generate three-dimensional (3D) regional strain and heterogeneity maps of healthy rat lungs and describe their changes over time. Methods Micro-CT and image-based biomechanical analysis by finite element approach were carried out in six anaesthetised rats under spontaneous breathing in two different states, at the beginning of the experiment and after 3 hours of observation. 3D regional strain maps were constructed and divided into 10 isovolumetric region-of-interest (ROI) in three directions (apex to base, dorsal to ventral and costal to mediastinal), allowing to regionally analyse the volumetric strain, the strain progression and the strain heterogeneity. To describe in depth these parameters, and systematise their report, we defined regional strain heterogeneity index [1+strain SD ROI(x)]/[1+strain mean ROI(x)] and regional strain progression index [ROI(x)-mean of final strain/ROI(x)-mean of initial strain]. Results We were able to generate 3D regional strain maps of the lung in subjects without respiratory support, showing significant differences among the three analysed axes. We observed a significantly lower regional volumetric strain in the apex sector compared with the base, with no significant anatomical systematic differences in the other directions. This heterogeneity could not be identified with physiological or standard CT methods. There was no progression of the analysed regional volumetric strain when the two time-points were compared. Discussion It is possible to map the regional volumetric strain in the lung for healthy subjects during spontaneous breathing. Regional strain heterogeneity and changes over time can be measured using a CT image-based numerical analysis applying a finite element approach. These results support that healthy lung might have significant regional strain and its spatial distribution is highly heterogeneous. This protocol for CT image acquisition and analysis could be a useful tool for helping to understand the mechanobiology of the lung in many diseases.']"

Ulmo honey (Eucryphia cordifolia) has demonstrated important bactericidal, fungicidal, antioxidant and healing properties. Ulmoplus®, a honey-based medicinal product, accelerates healing time and promotes fibroblast activation and collagen fiber production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of endogenous FGF-2 in burns treated with Ulmoplus® vs. the gold standard (hydrogel-tull), and Ulmo honey as the first step to clarifying the regulatory mechanism of this therapeutic option. 15 adult guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) were used, divided into three groups: C+: positive control treated with hydrogel-tull (gold standard); E1: experimental group treated with Ulmo; and E2: experimental group treated with Ulmoplus®. A deep uniform burn was made under anesthetic that covered 1 cm2 of the skin on the back of each animal. The daily treatments were administered with hydrogel-tull, Ulmo honey or Ulmoplus®, where appropriate. On treatment day 10 the biopsies were taken and processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. The immunolabeling was quantified through an integrated optical density (IOD) analysis, expressed as lum/µm2 using the Image-ProPremier 9.1 software. The endogenous expression of FGF-2 was consistent with the stage of healing presented by the study groups, varying in its localization and IOD intensity. The E2 group presented a significantly higher IOD (60053.55 ± 59877.84 lum/ µm2) than the C+ (p = 0.001) and E1 (p = 0.001) groups.

Input graphs are now commonly constrained through SHACL shapes allowing for both their validation and aiding users (as well as tools) in understanding their structure. However, it becomes challenging to understand what graph data can be expected at the end of a data processing pipeline without knowing the particular input data: Shape constraints on the input graph may affect the output graph, but may no longer apply literally, and new shapes may be imposed by the query itself. In our recent work, From Shapes to Shapes: Inferring SHACL Shapes for Results of SPARQL CONSTRUCT Queries, we studied the derivation of shape constraints that hold on all possible output graphs of a given SPARQL CONSTRUCT query by axiomatizing the query and the shapes with the AℒCℋOℐ description logic.

This has propelled many advances in query processing over knowledge graphs, however the aspect of providing provenance explanations for query results has so far been mostly neglected. We therefore propose a novel method, SPARQLprov, based on query rewriting, to compute how-provenance polynomials for SPARQL queries over knowledge graphs. Contrary to existing works, SPARQLprov is system-agnostic and can be applied to standard and already deployed SPARQL engines without the need of customized extensions. We rely on spm-semirings to compute polynomial annotations that respect the property of commutation with homomorphisms on monotonic and non-monotonic SPARQL queries without aggregate functions. Our evaluation on real and synthetic data shows that SPARQLprov over standard engines incurs an acceptable runtime overhead w.r.t. the original query, competing with state-of-the-art solutions for how-provenance computation.', 'TITLE: NPCS: Native Provenance Computation for SPARQL | KEYWORDS: data provenance; how-provenance; knowledge graphs; rdf; sparql | ABSTRACT: The popularity of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) both in industry and academia owes credit to their flexible data model, suitable for data integration from multiple sources. Several KG-based applications such as trust assessment or view maintenance on dynamic data rely on the ability to compute provenance explanations for query results. The how-provenance of a query result is an expression that encodes the records (triples or facts) that explain its inclusion in the result set. This article proposes NPCS, a Native Provenance Computation approach for SPARQL queries. NPCS annotates query results with their how-provenance. By building upon spm-provenance semirings, NPCS supports both monotonic and non-monotonic SPARQL queries. Thanks to its reliance on query rewriting techniques, the approach is directly applicable to already deployed SPARQL engines using different reification schemes - including RDF-star. Our experimental evaluation on two popular SPARQL engines (GraphDB and Stardog) shows that our novel query rewriting brings a significant runtime improvement over existing query rewriting solutions, scaling to RDF graphs with billions of triples.']"

Objective: To assess the association between the Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCD-Q), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β (Aβ). Methods: 56 cognitively healthy older adults and their informants answered the SCD-Q. Correlations between GM and SCD-Q scores were explored using structural voxel-based morphometry models including Aβ levels. SCD-Q∗Aβ vectors were calculated with higher scores reflecting higher SCD and cerebral amyloid, simultaneously. Subjects were classified according to their perception of cognitive worsening in the last two years, exploring for GM differences between-groups. Results: Higher self-reported SCD-Q scores correlated with reduced GM in the right frontal lobe and increased volumes in the occipital lobe, calcarine sulcus, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum, while higher informant's scores correlated with increased GM in the right middle temporal gyrus. Correlations were more significant for SCD-Q language items, self-complaints, and more positive than negative correlations were found. The SCD-Q∗Aβ vectors were negatively associated with GM both in self and informant's reports. Finally, lower Aβ levels related to lower GM in subjects who noticed cognitive worsening, but related to higher GM in subjects who have not noticed this decline.

Methods: Fifty-two individuals were included and SCD was quantified through the Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCD-Q), using its validated cutoff to classify participants as Low SCD-Q (n = 21) or High SCD-Q (n = 31). These groups were further subdivided according to the presence or absence of abnormal levels of CSF Aβ42. Objective cognitive performance was assessed with the Ancient Farming Equipment Test (AFE-T), a new highly-demanding test that calls for acquisition and retention of novel object/name pairs and allows measuring ALF over a 6-month period. Results: The High SCD-Q group showed a significantly higher free forgetting rate at 3 months compared to the Low SCD-Q (F [1,44] = 4.72; p < 0.05). When stratifying by amyloid status, High SCD-Q/Aβ+ showed a significantly lower performance than High SCD-Q/Aβ–on the final free and cued learning scores (F [1,27] = 6.44, p < 0.05 and F [1,27] = 7.51, p < 0.05, respectively), the 1-week free and cued recall (F [1,24] = 4.49; p < 0.05 and F [1,24] = 7.10; p < 0.01, respectively), the 1-week cued forgetting rate (F [1,24] = 5.13; p < 0.05), and the 3-month cued recall (F [1,24] = 4.27; p < 0.05).

Objectives: a) To compare the Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCD-Q) ratings between Pre-AD subjects and cognitively healthy controls, b) to study the association of SCD-Q scores with levels of AD biomarkers in cognitively healthy and cognitively impaired subjects, and c) to compare SCD-Q ratings in cognitively impaired subjects with or without abnormal Aβ42. Methods: Two hundred and seventeen participants (111 subjects; 106 informants) answered the SCD-Q. All subjects underwent a lumbar puncture to determine levels of Aβ42 and tau, and an extensive neuropsychological battery. Healthy subjects were classified as Controls (CTR) or Pre-AD according to the absence or the presence of abnormal Aβ42, and those with cognitive impairment (CI) into Non-amyloid (NonAB-CI) or Amyloid (AB-CI) impairment. Results: Informant's SCD-Q scores were significantly higher in the Pre-AD group than in the CTR group (F = 6.75; p = 0.01). No significant differences were found in self-ratings. In the cognitively impaired groups, there were no significant differences in the SCD-Q ratings. In the whole sample, informant's ratings of SCD-Q correlated with Aβ42 (r = -0.21; p = 0.02) and tau levels (r = 0.28; p = 0.00).

Results: Our results showed that fire activity was higher than present between 200 and 1500 CE, with peaks around 200–400 CE and 1100–1500 CE. Periods with high fire activity are associated with reduced forest cover, as Araucaria declined when mixed-severity fire regime occurred for extended periods. Pollen assemblages suggested a shift from dry to wet climate conditions at 1500 CE, and from 1750 CE onward, the arrival of exotic species reflected the land-use changes related to forest clearance and transhumance practices. Main Conclusions: The palaeoenvironmental reconstructions showed changes in vegetation, fire and climate over the past 1800 years in TNP. Wildfires have been the main disturbance process modifying the vegetation structure in the Araucaria and Nothofagus forests. Since 1750 CE intensive post-Hispanic land-use changes (forest clearances by fire and logging) took place in the study area, reducing the native vegetation cover. Climate variability, modulated by SAM-like and ENSO-like conditions, influenced the fire activity (availability and flammability of fuels), concomitantly with high archaeological density. The recent (after 2000 CE) increase of catastrophic wildfires may negatively affect the conservation strategies of Araucaria-Nothofagus forests.', 'TITLE: Fire history in Andean Araucaria-Nothofagus forests: Coupled influences of past human land-use and climate on fire regimes in north-west Patagonia | KEYWORDS: climate variability; dendroecology; El Niño Southern Oscillation; Native Americans; Southern Annular Mode; tree-rings | ABSTRACT: Historical fire regimes are critical for understanding the potential effects of changing climate and human land-use on forest landscapes. Fire is a major disturbance process affecting the Andean Araucaria forest landscape in north-west Patagonia. The main goals of this study were to reconstruct the fire history of the Andean Araucaria-Nothofagus forests and to evaluate the coupled influences of climate and humans on fire regimes. Reconstructions of past fires indicated that the Araucaria forest landscape has been shaped by widespread, stand-replacing fires favoured by regional interannual climate variability related to major tropical and extratropical climate drivers in the southern hemisphere. Summer precipitation and streamflow reconstructions tended to be below average during fire years. Fire events were significantly related to positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode and to warm and dry summers following El Niño events. Although Euro-Chilean settlement (1883-1960) resulted in widespread burning, cattle ranching by Pehuenche Native Americans during the 18th and 19th centuries also appears to have changed the fire regime. In the context of climate change, two recent widespread wildfires (2002 and 2015) affecting Araucaria forests appear to be novel and an early indication of a climate change driven shift in fire regimes in north-west Patagonia.', 'TITLE: Fire and vegetation dynamics of endangered Araucaria araucana communities in the forest-steppe ecotone of northern Patagonia | KEYWORDS: Disturbance regime; Historical range of variability; Human impact; Landscape fragmentation; Palaeoecology and biological conservation; Vegetation history | ABSTRACT: Recent changes of the fire regime in northern Patagonia may have reduced populations of Araucaria araucana, which is listed as an endangered species. Although Araucaria does not depend on fire to persist, natural fires are part of the ecosystem and Araucaria withstands moderate fires. To understand recent and long-term vegetation patterns and processes that help in conservation tasks, we reconstructed the vegetation and fire history of the forest-steppe ecotone over the last 9 kyr based on a well-dated sediment core obtained from Lake Relem in northern Patagonia. Before 4.5 ka, pollen content indicates that steppe vegetation dominated the landscape. Pollen composition after 4.5 ka suggests that steppe was gradually replaced by scrublands and woodlands. The highest amount of Nothofagus woodland cover was reconstructed for the last 2.5 kyr. A continuous record of macro-charcoal particles indicates 20 fire events of low magnitude, with more frequent fires between 6 and 2.5 ka. Changes in vegetation composition were partly related to fire frequency changes, while the magnitude of fire events had no detectable influence on the vegetation. Pollen from the endangered Araucaria documents that the species was widespread around Lake Relem between 8 and 6 ka, decreasing abruptly ~6 ka, and slightly increasing up to the present. Results do not show a change in the fire regime due to the Euro-American colonization. The long-term trend of this Araucaria population does not show the decline observed elsewhere.']"

To understand the reactivity of the nickel complexes withNacNac ligands, we used chemometric methods to classify different catalysts reported to date. The mechanism of the interaction of [L1Ni(η3-C3H5)][B(ArF)4]/B(C6F5)3with 1-hexene was studied by ESI-MS which allowed the detection of cationic species formedin situ. Moreover, there is a very small difference in reactivities from combination of nickel complexes and borane co-catalysts used for alkene isomerization, while the reactivity with ethylene of both systems is very different; [L1Ni(η3-C3H5)][B(ArF)4]/B(C6F5)3produces butene, while L1Ni(η3-C3H5)/B(C6F5)3forms polyethylene. Furthermore, DFT studies revealed that the origin of the catalytic activity in the cationic and neutral methallyl nickel complexes co-activated by B(C6F5)3is mainly from direct steric effects of the ligand-nickel center where the conformation of the chelate ring is affected by the catalyst symmetry. This work demonstrates how the cationic or neutral nature of the same system affects its catalytic and structural properties.', 'TITLE: The Role of Co-Activation and Ligand Functionalization in Neutral Methallyl Nickel(II) Catalysts for Ethylene Oligomerization and Polymerization | KEYWORDS: boron; ethylene; ligand effects; nickel complexes; polymerization | ABSTRACT: A detailed quantum chemical study that analyzed the mechanism of ethylene oligomerization and polymerization by means of a family of four neutral methallyl NiII catalysts is presented. The role of the boron co-activators, BF3 and B(C6F5)3, and the position of ligand functionalization (ortho or para position of the N-arylcyano moiety of the catalysts) were investigated to explain the chain length of the obtained polymers. The chain initialization proceeded with higher activation barriers for the ortho-functionalized complexes (≈19 kcal mol−1) than the para-substituted isomers (17–18 kcal mol−1). Two main pathways were revealed for the chain propagation: The first pathway was favored when using the B(C6F5)3 co-activated catalyst, and it produced long-chain polymers. A second pathway led to the β-hydrogen complexes, which resulted in chain oligomerization; this pathway was preferred when the BF3 co-activated catalysts were used. Otherwise, the termination of longer chains occurred via a stable hydride intermediate, which was formed with an energy barrier of about 14 kcal mol−1 for the B(C6F5)3 co-activated catalysts. Significant new insights were made into the reaction mechanism, whereby neutral methallyl NiII catalysts act in oligomerization and polymerization processes. Specifically, the role of co-activation and ligand functionalization, which are key information for the further design of related catalysts, were revealed.', 'TITLE: How does the SiO2-supported nickel catalyst improve the ethylene polymerization process? Insights from DFT studies | KEYWORDS: DFT calculations; Ethylene polymerization; Heterogeneous catalyst; Nickel catalyst; SiO2-supported catalyst | ABSTRACT: Polymerization of ethylene plays a pivotal role in the production of polyethylene, a widely used polymer. Efficient catalysts are crucial for enhancing the polymerization process and improving polymer properties. In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the influence of the SiO2 surface by linker approach on the reactivity of ethylene polymerization catalyzed by the Ni-α-imine ketone-type complex. Our results unveil valuable insights into molecular interactions and mechanistic aspects driving the improved polymerization process in good agreement with experimental findings. We identify strong hydrogen bonds as the key factor facilitating the favorable binding of the molecular catalyst with the SiO2 surface, involving a chemisorption process. Furthermore, we find that chain initiation is a rate-determining step for the molecular catalyst, whereas chain propagation is rate-determining for the supported catalyst, aligning with experimental differences in ethylene polymerization activity. Energy decomposition analysis reveals the dominant roles of electrostatic and orbital interactions in stabilizing both catalysts. Notably, the chemisorbed catalyst exhibits enhanced catalyst-ethylene interaction, while steric effects primarily impact the reactivity of the homogeneous catalyst. The supported catalyst exhibits a higher propagation barrier due to a late transition state. Additionally, the heterogeneous catalyst demonstrates superior ethylene uptake and thermal stability across a range of temperatures in agreement with the experimental data. These findings offer guidance for future experimental designs, emphasizing the importance of heterogenization and catalyst-ethylene interaction for enhancing ethylene polymerization processes.']"

To date there are four systematic reviews suggesting a beneficial impact for mobilisation in mechanically ventilated and intensive care unit (ICU) patients, however there is limited information about the influence of timing, frequency and duration of sessions. Earlier mobilisation during ICU stay may lead to greater benefits. This study aims to determine the effect of early rehabilitation for functional status in ICU/high-dependency unit (HDU) patients. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINALH, PEDro, Cochrane Library, AMED, ISI web of science, Scielo, LILACS and several clinical trial registries were searched for randomised and non-randomised clinical trials of rehabilitation compared to usual care in adult patients admitted to an ICU/HDU. Results were screened by two independent reviewers. Primary outcome was functional status. Secondary outcomes were walking ability, muscle strength, quality of life, and healthcare utilisation. Data extraction and methodological quality assessment using the PEDro scale was performed by primary reviewer and checked by two other reviewers. The authors of relevant studies were contacted to obtain missing data. Results: 5733 records were screened. Seven articles were included in the narrative synthesis and six in the meta-analysis. Early rehabilitation had no significant effect on functional status, muscle strength, quality of life, or healthcare utilisation. However, early rehabilitation led to significantly more patients walking without assistance at hospital discharge (risk ratio 1.42; 95% CI 1.17-1.72). There was a non-significant effect favouring intervention for walking distance and incidence of ICU-acquired weakness. Conclusions: Early rehabilitation during ICU stay was not associated with improvements in functional status, muscle strength, quality of life or healthcare utilisation outcomes, although it seems to improve walking ability compared to usual care. Results from ongoing studies may provide more data on the potential benefits of early rehabilitation in critically ill patients.', ""TITLE: Effect of a clinical pharmacist on 30-day revisits following discharge from an emergency department: a randomized controlled clinical trial Efecto del farmacéutico clínico en las reconsultas a los 30 días posalta del servicio de urgencias: ensayo clínico controlado | KEYWORDS: Emergency health services.; Farmacéutico.; Medication review.; Pharmacist.; Revisión de medicación.; Servicio de Emergencias. | ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a clinical pharmacist's inclusion in emergency department (ED) care in terms of the effect on on 30-day revisits after discharge from the ED and patient satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized, controlled parallel-group pragmatic trial in a university hospital ED. Recruited patients were randomly assigned to a control group for standard care only or an intervention group to receive standard care plus the attention of a clinical pharmacist integrated into the care team to optimize the selection and evaluation of medications and provide pharmacotherapeutic education on the patient's discharge. The primary outcome was unplanned revisits within 30 days after discharge because of the same complaint that led to the initial ED visit. Between-group differences were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests. The association between the intervention and time to the outcome event was explored with multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1001 patients were enrolled (intervention, 500; control, 501). Patients in both groups were similar. A majority were women (61.5%), and the median age (interquartile range) was 51 years (33-65 years). The pharmacist's intervention significantly reduced the number of 30-day revisits to any ED: 25 (6.3%) revisited vs 66 (16.7%) in the control group. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.17-0.50). Fifteen patients (3.0%) from the intervention group revisited the same ED vs 32 (6.5%) from the control group (aHR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.24-0.87]). More patients expressed satisfaction in the intervention group (87.2%) than in the control group ( 83.2%) (P .05). CONCLUSION: Including a clinical pharmacist in ED care substantially reduces the number of 30-day revisits and increases patient satisfaction. OBJETIVO: Determinar el efecto de la inclusión del farmacéutico clínico en el servicio de urgencias (SU) en las reconsultas durante 30 días posalta y la satisfacción de los pacientes. METODO: Ensayo clínico controlado, aleatorizado, paralelo y pragmático, realizado en el SU de un hospital universitario. Los pacientes reclutados fueron asignados aleatoriamente al grupo control (GC) que recibió la atención habitual o al grupo intervenido (GI) que recibió además la atención de un farmacéutico clínico, el cual se integró al equipo clínico para optimizar la selección, evaluación y educación farmacoterapéutica en el SU y al alta. El desenlace primario fue reconsultas no programadas 30 días posaltarelacionadas con la atención inicial al SU. Las diferencias entre grupos se analizaron por curvas de supervivencia de Kaplan-Meier y prueba de log-rank. La asociación entre intervención y tiempo al evento fue analizada mediante regresión multivariada de riesgos proporcionales de Cox y se expresó como hazard ratio ajustada (HRa). RESULTADOS: Un total de 1.001 pacientes ingresaron al estudio (GI = 500 y GC = 501). Ambos grupos eran similares, predominaron las mujeres (61,5%), edad 51 años (RIC: 33-65). La intervención redujo significativamente las reconsultas a cualquier centro durante 30 días posalta comparado con GC [25 (6,3%) vs 66 (16,7%); HRa: 0,29 (IC 95%: 0,17-0,50)] y para el mismo centro [15 (3,0%) vs 32 (6,5%); HRa: 0,46 (IC 95%: 0,24-0,87)]. La satisfacción del usuario fue mayor en el GI que GC (87,2% vs 83,2%; p 0,05).

Early enteral nutrition is recommended in many clinical practice guidelines, although there appears to be a lack of evidence for its use and benefit. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of early enteral nutrition (initiated within 48 hours of initial injury or ICU admission) versus delayed enteral nutrition (initiated later than 48 hours after initial injury or ICU admission), with or without supplemental parenteral nutrition, in critically ill adults. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to April 2019), Embase Ovid SP (1974 to April 2019), CINAHL EBSCO (1982 to April 2019), and ISI Web of Science (1945 to April 2019). We also searched Turning Research Into Practice (TRIP), trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN registry), and scientific conference reports, including the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. We applied no restrictions by language or publication status. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared early versus delayed enteral nutrition, with or without supplemental parenteral nutrition, in adults who were in the ICU for longer than 72 hours. This included individuals admitted for medical, surgical, and trauma diagnoses, and who required any type of enteral nutrition. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted study data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We expressed results as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data, and as mean differences (MD) for continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included seven RCTs with a total of 345 participants. Outcome data were limited, and we judged many trials to have an unclear risk of bias in several domains. Early versus delayed enteral nutrition Six trials (318 participants) assessed early versus delayed enteral nutrition in general, medical, and trauma ICUs in the USA, Australia, Greece, India, and Russia. Primary outcomes Five studies (259 participants) measured mortality. It is uncertain whether early enteral nutrition affects the risk of mortality within 30 days (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.38; 1 study, 38 participants; very low-quality evidence). Four studies (221 participants) reported mortality without describing the timeframe; we did not pool these results. None of the studies reported a clear difference in mortality between groups. Three studies (156 participants) reported infectious complications. We were unable to pool the results due to unreported data and substantial clinical heterogeneity. The results were inconsistent across studies. One trial measured feed intolerance or gastrointestinal complications; it is uncertain whether early enteral nutrition affects this outcome (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.01; 59 participants; very low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes One trial assessed hospital length of stay and reported a longer stay in the early enteral group (median 15 days (interquartile range (IQR) 9.5 to 20) versus 12 days (IQR 7.5 to15); P = 0.05; 59 participants; very low-quality evidence). Three studies (125 participants) reported the duration of mechanical ventilation. We did not pool the results due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity. The results were inconsistent across studies. It is uncertain whether early enteral nutrition affects the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.06; 4 studies, 192 participants; very low-quality evidence). Early enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition versus delayed enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition We identified one trial in a burn ICU in the USA (27 participants). Primary outcomes It is uncertain whether early enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition affects the risk of mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.18; very low-quality evidence), or infectious complications (MD 0.00, 95% CI-1.94 to 1.94; very low-quality evidence). There were no data available for feed intolerance or gastrointestinal complications. Secondary outcomes It is uncertain whether early enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 9.00, 95% CI-10.99 to 28.99; very low-quality evidence). There were no data available for hospital length of stay or pneumonia. Authors' conclusions Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether early enteral nutrition, compared with delayed enteral nutrition, affects the risk of mortality within 30 days, feed intolerance or gastrointestinal complications, or pneumonia. Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain if early enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition compared with delayed enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition reduces mortality, infectious complications, or duration of mechanical ventilation. There is currently insufficient evidence; there is a need for large, multicentred studies with rigorous methodology, which measure important clinical outcomes.""]"

Data Science and Big Data approaches are technologies that enable the creation of accurate systems that model reality. However, classical Data Mining techniques are presented by professionals as black boxes. This evokes a lack of trust in those techniques in the medical domain.

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae), which is one of the most widespread and destructive primary pests of Prunus (plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, almonds), pear, walnuts, and chestnuts, among other. Four benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (coclaurine, laurolitsine, boldine, and pukateine) were isolated from the above mentioned plant species and evaluated regarding their insecticidal activity against the codling moth and fruit fly. The results showed that these alkaloids possess acute and chronic insecticidal effects. The most relevant effect was observed at 10 µg/mL against D. melanogaster and at 50 µg/mL against C. pomonella, being the alteration of the feeding, deformations, failure in the displacement of the larvae in the feeding medium of D. melanogaster, and mortality visible effects. In addition, the docking results show that these type of alkaloids present a good interaction with octopamine and ecdysone receptor showing a possible action mechanism.', 'TITLE: In vitro interaction of Metarhizium anisopliae Ma9236 and Beauveria bassiana Bb9205 with Heterorhabditis bacteriophora HNI0100 for the control of Plutella xylostella | KEYWORDS: Biological control; Broccoli; Diamondback moth; Entomopathogenic fungi; Entomopathogenic nematodes | ABSTRACT: The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is a major pest of broccoli crops in Colombia. To control P. xylostella, we evaluated the interaction of Beauveria bassiana Bb9205 and Metarhizium anisopliae Ma9236 with Heterorhabditis bacteriophora HNI0100 and its bacterial symbiont Photorhabdus luminescens HNI0100. We used antagonism and disk diffusion assays with fungal extracts to test the interaction between symbiotic bacterium and fungi. P. luminescens inhibited the growth of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae up to 40% by the secretion of secondary metabolites, whereas fungal extracts did not inhibit P. luminescens; this explains the in vivo interactions of these biological control agents. To test the interaction between fungi and nematodes, we first inoculated the fungi followed by the nematodes on different days (0, 2, 4, and 6). We identified the type of interaction using the formula by Nishimatsu and Jackson (J Econ Entomol 91:410–418, 1998) and established that on days 0, 2 and 4 there was an antagonistic interaction, while a synergistic interaction occurred on day 6. Therefore, the use of the interaction between H. bacteriophora HNI0100 with M. anisopliae Ma9236 and B. bassiana Bb9205 is an innovative alternative for the control of P. xylostella.', 'TITLE: Susceptibility of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae; Linnaeus 1758) to Beauveria bassiana Bb9205, Metarhizium anisopliae Ma9236 and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora HNI0100 | KEYWORDS: Biological control; Broccoli; Diamondback moth; Entomopathogenic fungi; Entomopathogenic nematodes | ABSTRACT: The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is a major pest of broccoli worldwide.

In urban spaces, especially in public spaces, environmental conditions are becoming more uncomfortable and this is affecting the health and quality of life of city dwellers. This study of climate quality in the city of Chillán revealed that there are insufficient public spaces to provide acceptable environmental quality for the entire population. It also showed that high-income areas, located in the peri-urban zones of the city, enjoy a better climate, environment, and air quality.

The indicators defined to measure progress are the recycling rate and Tons of material recycled. Paradoxically, very little is known about these indicators and the factors influencing them outside rich countries, where recycling has been long ago adopted. This study provides the first analysis of factors linked to separate collection rates and kilograms recycled per capita from actually existing municipal recycling services in a Latin American country. Thanks to primary data collection, it is possible to characterise and analyse the Chilean case. By 2018, barely above half of the 345 local governments had implemented recycling. Furthermore, even among municipalities that have been recycling for at least 5 years, separate collection is much lower than in any OECD country with available data. Econometric models are used to test nine different hypotheses about factors influencing municipal recycling. Existence of kerbside separate collection, duration of recycling programs and per capita spending on waste management are found to be positively and significantly linked to separate collection rates. Collection frequency of landfill waste is significant and negatively linked to higher separate collection rates within municipalities, but the same link is not significant between local governments. Four of the Chilean regions are found to be significantly lagging behind compared to the Santiago Metropolitan Region. Variables that are not significant are existence of organic recycling, population density, total population and poverty rate.', 'TITLE: Income inequality and efficient resources allocation policy for the adoption of a recycling program by municipalities in developing countries: The case of Chile | KEYWORDS: Developing countries; Inequality; Mathematical models; Municipal solid waste management; Recycling program; Redistribution | ABSTRACT: The question about how to choose the best recycling policy is particularly relevant in developing countries. On the one hand, many of these countries have no national waste management strategies, with recycling programs emerging as an independent initiative financed by municipalities, mostly in urban areas. On the other hand, the municipal budget tends to be linked to the wealth of their inhabitants. Consequently, an efficient municipal resources allocation policy to support recycling programs is especially crucial for the most vulnerable population, often located in rural areas. In this paper, we address the problem of optimal allocation of resources for the adoption of a recycling program by municipalities located in both urban and rural areas of a developing country, determining the best combination between two options: increasing and redistributing existing resources. Our research methods involve comprehensive data collection and mathematical modelling, adopting a logistic regression model proposed in the literature, formulating a non-linear optimisation model, and implementing a resolution method. In addition, recycling policies with equivalent results are described and analysed, discussing their political feasibility and economic efficiency.

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of psychological, cultural and socio-structural factors in the level of digital immersion in adolescents from southern Chile. A non-probabilistic sample of 469 adolescents was collected from schools with different socioeconomic backgrounds. A multigroup analysis was performed using structural equations modelling. The results indicate that family income moderate digital immersion model. Furthermore, for low-income and middle-to-high-income students, the attitude towards the use of digital technologies was the most important factor to predict digital immersion, followed by motivation. However, the results indicate differences between groups by family income in the following model’s path: from navigation skills to social skills; motivation to satisfaction; self-transcendence value to social skills; and attitude towards the use of technology to motivation. This study provided an opportunity to move forward in the understanding of the relationship between Chilean adolescents and their technology use. These results indicate the existence of deep cultural changes in Chilean adolescents’ life, which are strongly marked by the profuse use of digital technologies. IMPACT SUMMARY a. Prior State of Knowledge: The use of digital technologies has been studied in different contexts, considering diverse population, but adolescents’ immersion in digital technologies has not been addressed in the Chilean context. This lack of knowledge might affect a deeper understanding of technology use. b. Novel Contributions: The current study addresses and proposes a new definition of adolescents’ digital immersion taking into consideration psychological, cultural and socio-structural factors, allowing a more integrated, and empirically based, approach to the phenomenon. c.

This study aims to analyze the frequency of academic, entertainment, social and economic digital technologies uses in student teachers according to four variables: type of digital competence, sex, years in the student teacher program and failure of subjects. A total number of 615 student teachers from two Chilean universities answered a questionnaire that measures five digital competences (taken from DigComp) in every of four uses already mentioned. The results showed an inverse relationship between the complexity of competences and the frequency of their use. Women reported a higher academic use and a lower entertainment use than men. Moreover, students with one or two years in the program reported lower academic, social and economic uses. The observed inverse relationship between the complexity of the competences and the frequency of economic and entertainment uses was more robust among the students who had not failed any subjects. In conclusion, it may say that the results contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between purposes of use, their frequency of use and the development of digital competences.', 'TITLE: Chilean student teachers’ purposes of use of digital technologies: Construction of a scale based on digital competences Propósitos de uso de tecnologías digitales en estudiantes de pedagogía chilenos: Construcción de una escala basada en competencias digitales | KEYWORDS: Digital competence; educational technology; higher education; measurement; teacher education | ABSTRACT: The acquisition of digital competences enables people’s active development in different areas of society. In the case of many young people, and especially among future teachers, this acquisition is obtained through the daily use of digital technologies. Having instruments to measure digital competences associated to different purposes of use can contribute to provide feedback on the acquisition of these competences during initial teacher training processes. The aim of this study was to construct and psychometrically analyze the Scale of Purposes of Use and Digital Competences (EPUCD, by its acronym in Spanish). A sample of 618 student teachers from two Chilean universities answered a questionnaire that measures academic, entertainment, social and economic uses, considering DigComp as a digital competence framework. The statistical procedures carried out (EFA, CFA, composite reliability and average variance extracted) allowed to obtain appropriate evidences of this instrument’s structural and discriminant validity and internal consistency. The acceptable psychometric properties of EPUCD allow to provide an instrument for the academic community that contributes to reveal how future teachers use these digital technologies, offering feedback on the initial teacher training process.']"

Likewise, the access to electricity of isolated communities in developing countries plays a fundamental role in improving the quality of life of their inhabitants. In this context, Microgrids become potential alternatives to provide electricity to locations in Ecuador where the National Interconnected System does not reach. In this work, an Energy Management System (EMS) for an isolated MG based on Model Predictive Control is developed with the aim to minimize the MG operating costs, reliably and safely electricity supply while satisfying the users' comfort requirements in an isolated rural area of Ecuador. The electro-thermal MG considered is composed of a photovoltaic generator, a diesel generator, a lead-acid battery bank, electrical loads, and a Domestic Hot Water system consisting of an Electric Water Heater and a water storage tank. Simulations are carried out using weather data obtained through Solcast API for the year 2020.

The methodology considers the formulation of a stochastic optimization problem (SOP) that requires a previous evaluation of the renewable energy sources available in the area and the demand load profile of the community. In addition, to estimate the daily demand load curve of the rural community, the household classifier based on a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) method is used, that provides demand patterns by the use of the socio-economic characteristics of the community obtained in a survey. The methodology is applied in a community located on the banks of the Aguarico river.

The methodology considers the formulation of a stochastic optimization problem (SOP) that requires a previous evaluation of the renewable energy sources available in the area and the demand load profile of the community. In addition, to estimate the daily demand load curve of the rural community, the household classifier based on a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) method is used, that provides demand patterns by the use of the socio-economic characteristics of the community obtained in a survey. The methodology is applied in a community located on the banks of the Aguarico river. Three scenarios are evaluated, in which scenario I and II, only renewable energy sources are considered, scenario II is modelled including a budget constraint, that is not included in scenario I, and scenario III incorporates the implementation of gas generator set (GGS) unit in order to obtain a technical and economical viable solution, based on the renewable energy sources assessment.

This work reports the application of molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MINs) as synthetic antibodies in a microplate assay for tetracycline (TC) determination at subnanomolar levels. MINs with hydrodynamic radii ranging from 200 to 300 nm were synthesized via solid-phase imprinting on magnetic nanoparticles using lymecycline (LMC) as an auxiliary template. MINs immobilized onto polystyrene microplates exhibited a selective binding of the conjugate between LMC and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), yielding analytical responses up to fourfold higher than those observed in blank wells. MINs saturated with LMC-HPR showed the quantitative displacement of the conjugate upon incubation with LMC or TC, yielding concentration-proportional responses from 0.001 to 100 nmol L-1. For LMC, we obtained limits of detection (LOD) between 0.018 and 0.020 nmol L-1 and limits of quantification (LOQ) from 0.054 to 0.061 nmol L-1. For TC, the LOD values ranged between 0.001 and 0.006 nmol L-1, with LOQ values of 0.004-0.019 nmol L-1. Within the studied concentration range, the analytical responses of MINs were two to five times higher than those obtained from nonimprinted materials or blank controls. These findings support the performance of MINs as antibody mimetics with high recognition capacity, relatively low production costs, and robust analytical applications.', 'TITLE: Molecularly imprinted nanoparticle-based assay (MINA) for microcystin-LR detection in water | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Microcystins (MCs) are highly toxic peptides produced by cyanobacteria during algal blooms. Microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR) is the most toxic and common MC variant with major effects on human and animal health upon exposure. MC-LR detection has become critical to ensure water safety, therefore robust and reliable analytical methods are needed. This work reports the development of a simple and optimized Molecularly Imprinted Nanoparticle-Based Assay (MINA) for MC-LR detection in water. Molecularly Imprinted Nanoparticles (MINs) were prepared by solid-phase polymerization on glass beads conjugated to MC-LR through (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) via amide bonding. APTES-modified glass beads were obtained under optimized conditions to maximize the density of surface amino groups available for MC-LR conjugation. Two quinary mixtures of acrylic monomers differing in charge, polarity, and functionality were selected from molecular docking calculations and used to obtain MINs for MC-LR recognition using N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide (BIS) as the crosslinking agent. MINs were immobilized by physical adsorption onto 96-well polystyrene microplate and evaluated as per their rebinding capacity toward the analyte by using a covalent conjugate between MC-LR and the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Experimental conditions for the MINs immobilization protocol, HRP-MC-LR concentration, and composition of the blocking solution were set to maximize the colorimetric response of the MINs compared to non-treated wells. Optimized conditions were then applied to conduct competitive MINAs with the HRP-MC-LR conjugate and the free analyte, which confirmed the preferential binding of MC-LR to the immobilized MINs for analyte concentrations ranging from 1 × 10−5 nmol L−1 to 100 nmol L−1. The best competitive MINA showed a limit of detection of 2.49 × 10−4 nmol L−1 and coefficients of variation less than 10% (n = 6), which are auspicious for the use of MINs as analytical tools for MC-LR detection below the permissible limits issued by WHO for safe water consumption (1.00 nmol L−1).

In Antarctica, however, the relationship of taxonomic and functional diversity with ecosystem properties (e.g., community biomass) has received less attention, despite the presence of sharp and dynamic environmental stress gradients that might modulate these properties. Here, we investigated whether the richness-biomass relationship in macrobenthic subtidal communities is still apparent after accounting for environmental stress gradients in Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica. Measurements of biomass of mobile and sessile macrobenthic taxa were conducted in the austral summer 2013/4 across two environmental stress gradients: distance from nearest glaciers and subtidal depth (from 5 to 30 m). In general, community biomass increased with distance from glaciers and water depth. However, generalised additive models showed that distance from glaciers and depth accounted for negligible proportions of variation in the number of functional groups (i.e., functional richness) and community biomass when compared to taxonomic richness. Functional richness and community biomass were positive and saturating functions of taxonomic richness. Large endemic, canopy-forming brown algae of the order Desmarestiales dominated the community biomass across both gradients. Accordingly, differences in the composition of taxa accounted for a significant and large proportion (51%) of variation in community biomass in comparison with functional richness (10%). Our results suggest that the environmental factors here analysed may be less important than biodiversity in shaping mesoscale (several km) biomass patterns in this Antarctic system. We suggest that further manipulative, hypothesis-driven research should address the role of biodiversity and species' functional traits in the responses of Antarctic subtidal communities to environmental variation.

But to adopt static security types, like other advanced type disciplines, programmers face a steep wholesale transition, often forcing them to refactor working code just to satisfy their type checker. To provide a gentler path to security typing that supports safe and stylish but hard-to-verify programming idioms, researchers have designed languages that blend static and dynamic checking of security types. Unfortunately, most of the resulting languages only support static, type-based reasoning about noninterference if a program is entirely statically secured. This limitation substantially weakens the benefits that dynamic enforcement brings to static security typing. Additionally, current proposals are focused on languages with explicit casts and therefore do not fulfill the vision of gradual typing, according to which the boundaries between static and dynamic checking only arise from the (im)precision of type annotations and are transparently mediated by implicit checks. In this article, we present GSLRef, a gradual security-typed higher-order language with references. As a gradual language, GSLRef supports the range of static-to-dynamic security checking exclusively driven by type annotations, without resorting to explicit casts. Additionally, GSLRef lets programmers use types to reason statically about termination-insensitive noninterference in all programs, even those that enforce security dynamically. We prove that GSLRef satisfies all but one of Siek et al.'s criteria for gradually-typed languages, which ensure that programs can seamlessly transition between simple typing and security typing. A notable exception regards the dynamic gradual guarantee, which some specific programs must violate if they are to satisfy noninterference; it remains an open question whether such a language could fully satisfy the dynamic gradual guarantee. To realize this design, we were led to draw a sharp distinction between syntactic type safety and semantic type soundness, each of which constrains the design of the gradual language."", 'TITLE: Gradual parametricity, revisited | KEYWORDS: Gradual typing; Parametricity; Polymorphism | ABSTRACT: Bringing the benefits of gradual typing to a language with parametric polymorphism like System F, while preserving relational parametricity, has proven extremely challenging: first attempts were formulated a decade ago, and several designs were recently proposed.

The incorporation of next-generation sequencing into clinical settings, particularly exome and genome sequencing, has resulted in an unprecedented improvement in diagnosis and discovery in the past decade. Nevertheless, these tools are unavailable in many countries, increasing health care gaps between high- and low-and-middle-income countries and prolonging the “diagnostic odyssey” for patients. To advance genomic diagnoses in a setting of limited genomic resources, we developed DECIPHERD, an undiagnosed diseases program in Chile. DECIPHERD was implemented in two phases: training and local development. The training phase relied on international collaboration with Baylor College of Medicine, and the local development was structured as a hybrid model, where clinical and bioinformatics analysis were performed in-house and sequencing outsourced abroad, due to lack of high-throughput equipment in Chile. We describe the implementation process and findings of the first 103 patients. They had heterogeneous phenotypes, including congenital anomalies, intellectual disabilities and/or immune system dysfunction. Patients underwent clinical exome or research exome sequencing, as solo cases or with parents using a trio design. We identified pathogenic, likely pathogenic or variants of unknown significance in genes related to the patients´ phenotypes in 47 (45.6%) of them. Half were de novo informative variants, and half of the identified variants have not been previously reported in public databases. DECIPHERD ended the diagnostic odyssey for many participants. This hybrid strategy may be useful for settings of similarly limited genomic resources and lead to discoveries in understudied populations.', 'TITLE: Prevalence of filaggrin loss-of-function variants in Chilean population with and without atopic dermatitis | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Background: Filaggrin (FLG) loss-of-function variants are major genetic risk factors for atopic dermatitis (AD), but these have not been studied in Latin American populations with and without AD.

However, it is unclear what effect hormonal contraception has on telomere length, a marker of the risk for complications. Objective: To investigate the relative telomere length (RTL) in AYA with T1D (AYA-T1D) and healthy young women (AYA-C) after 18 months of combined oral contraception use (COC) with ethinyl estradiol/desogestrel, or a subdermal etonogestrel implant (IM). Methods: A nonrandomized prospective study was performed in which 39 AYA-T1D and 40 AYA-C chose the COC or the IM. RTL was measured by monochrome multiplex-quantitative PCR in DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The impact of contraceptives and clinical variables on RTL was assessed using lineal regression analysis. Results: Longer RTL compared to baseline was observed in AYA-T1D (P <. 05) and AYA-C (P <. 01) after using the IM. However, the total of AYA and the AYA-C group treated with COC decreased RTL after 18 months of treatment compared to baseline (P <. 05). The type of contraceptive used was determinant for the changes in RTL compared to baseline in all subjects and controls (P ≤. 006). For AYA-T1D, HbA1c levels were not associated with RTL, but the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was negatively related with the changes in RTL at 18 months compared to baseline (standardized R2: 0.230, P =. 003). Conclusion: IM was associated with longer RTL in AYA-T1D and AYA-C.

Methods We undertook a prospective active national surveillance via the British Ophthalmic Surveillance Unit. Eligible cases were children aged 18 years or younger, with type 1 or 2 diabetes, newly diagnosed between January 2015 and February 2017 with sight-threatening diabetic eye disease. Results Eight children were reported. The annual incidence of all sight-threatening diabetes-related eye disease requiring referral to an ophthalmologist among children living with diabetes (n=8) in the UK was 1.21 per 10 000 person-years (95% CI 0.52 to 2.39) and was largely attributable to cataract (n=5) 0.76 per 10 000 person-years (95% CI 0.25 to 1.77). The incidence of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (n=3) among those eligible for screening (12 to 18 year-olds living with diabetes) was 1.18 per 10 000 person-years (95% CI 0.24 to 3.46). No subjects eligible for certification as visually impaired or blind were reported. Conclusions Secondary prevention of visual disability due to retinopathy is currently the sole purpose of national eye screening programmes globally. However, the rarity of treatment-requiring retinopathy in children/young people living with diabetes, alongside growing concerns about suboptimal screening uptake, merit new consideration of the utility of screening for primary prevention of diabetes-related morbidity by using the screening event and findings as a catalyst for better diabetes self-management.', 'TITLE: Subdermal Progestin Implant and an Oral Combined Hormonal Contraceptive in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes | KEYWORDS: Adolescent; Blood glucose; Body weight; Contraception; Inflammation; Long-acting reversible contraception; Type 1 diabetes | ABSTRACT: Study Objective: To determine the metabolic effects of the subcutaneous etonogestrel implant compared with an oral contraceptive in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on body weight, body composition, glucose, lipids, and C-reactive protein levels. Methods: This was a non-randomized, interventional, prospective study. Thirty-nine AYAs with T1D participated; 20 used the implant (Implant-T1D), and 19 used an oral combined contraceptive (OC-T1D). Body composition, HbA1c, intermittent continuous glucose monitoring, lipids, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were evaluated. Results: All participants were followed for at least 12 months, and 26 completed the 24-month follow-up. No women discontinued the intervention due to adverse effects. Body weight increased by 0.8 ± 3.5 and 1 ± 2.9 kg in the OC-T1D and the Implant-T1D group at 12 months and by 2.6 ± 3.9 and 3.3 ± 3.6 kg at 24 months, respectively. OC-T1D and Implant-T1D had similar HbA1c, mean interstitial glucose levels, and time in range throughout the study; no significant difference over time was observed. hsCRP levels increased in both groups and were associated with BMI and HbA1c (P < .001 for both variables). Women in the OC-T1D group had higher total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglyceride levels compared with the Implant-T1D. Conclusion: Glucose levels were similar in youth using the subdermal progestin implant and an OC. However, both AYA groups showed increased BMI, fat mass, and subclinical inflammation. Changes in lipid levels were associated with the OC method. These data highlight the importance of weight gain prevention in young women with T1D using hormonal contraception.']"

The objective of this research was to determine the effect of the combined nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilization on soil characteristics, growth traits and quality of shoots and fruits in cocoa. The experiment was carried out under a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement, with three factors, N, P and K, and two levels by factor (with and without fertilization), plus an absolute control without fertilization. The chemical characteristics of the soil, including pH, N, P, K, Ca and Mg content were evaluated. New shoots were also evaluated by measuring its number, length, leaf area, and growth rate. In the fruits, the weight, length and growth rate were measured. In shoots and fruits, quality traits including dry matter, fiber, ash, lipids and protein content were measured. Significant interactions of the applied nutrients were found, which increased the content of P and K, and decreased Ca and Mg of the soil. The N fertilization alone did not affect the growth of the shoots and foliar area.

However, far too little attention has been paid to the nutritional aspects. On the other hand, nitrogen is the most important nutrient in crop production, and mineral nitrogen fertilizers are the most widely used by farmers. Improving the efficiency of nitrogen uptake and utilization could potentially increase crop yields and quality, as well as reduce nitrogen fertilization and environmental pollution. Objective. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of three nitrogen sources on morphological characteristics, yield and quality of CCN-51 cocoa, and soil chemical characteristics in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

Understanding and improving its sperm capacity to withstand short-term storage conditions is a key element of initiating an artificial propagation program for this species. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ultrastructure and quality of E. maclovinus sperm during refrigerated storage. To address this objective, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cytofluorimetric analysis (membrane integrity; reactive oxygen species generation; mitochondrial membrane potential) and cell respiration/mitochondrial-function analysis (ATP content; oxygen consumption) could be useful for optimizing or improving management for artificial reproduction of this species. Severe damage of plasma membranes was observed by SEM at day 7 and 14 of in vitro storage. Analyses of sperm quality were conducted during the 14-day cold storage period when sperm were in diluted (with Cortland solution) and undiluted conditions. When there were diluted conditions, there was greater preservation of motile capacity (from day-7; P < 0.05), membrane integrity (from day-7; P < 0.05), mitochondrial membrane potential (from day-10; P < 0.05) and ATP stores (from day-3; P < 0.05). Oxygen consumption indicators were 18.6% ±14.7% greater in the undiluted samples from day-3, and 32.1%±2.1% of the total spermatozoa had ample amounts of superoxide anion in both undiluted and diluted semen on day-0. The use of Cortland solution extended the viability of sperm when there were longer storage times. Factors that have a greater effect on the quality of semen during storage are reactive oxygen species generation and ATP depletion.

Patrocinato e governos partidários em Portugal | KEYWORDS: Elite interviews; Party government; Patronage; Public administration | ABSTRACT: Patronage has been interpreted as an important dimension of the party government model. However, patronage has been conventionally associated with the distribution of jobs in public administration aiming to reward services rendered to the party in government. This is not entirely satisfactory. The growing complexity of governance processes, together with the growing influence of the upper echelons of the civil service in policy making has prompted politicians to search for new ways of controlling the bureaucracy. Through the use of elite interviews, this article seeks to analyze the emergence of an instrumental dimension of patronage, as a potential key resource for parties in government to control the policy-making process and retain a role in modern democratic governance.', 'TITLE: The many faces of (party) appointments: Party government and patronage in Portugal, 1995-2009 | KEYWORDS: civil service; party government; patronage; Portugal | ABSTRACT: In recent years there has been a renewed interest in the political recruitment to non-elective public offices of the state. Such appointments can help entrench party organizations, cementing their position within the state and can also emerge as an instrument to provide parties with leverage over (and crucial information within) the increasingly fragmented and delegated processes of policymaking. Portugal has been conceived as a country with appointments deep into the administrative hierarchy, mainly motivated by partisan considerations. These accounts overlook the different rationales for patronage. This article aims to re-examine accounts on the (many) faces of patronage, by empirically exploring the logics of recruitment on three inter-related dimensions. First, to what extent different hierarchical levels are associated to different patronage functions. Second, by analysing the extent to which different moments of the governing period are associated to different faces of patronage. Third, by assessing the impact of party competition on patterns and logics of recruitment to the civil service.', ""TITLE: Party Patronage in Portugal: Treading in Shallow Water | KEYWORDS: Bureaucracy; Democratization; Party patronage; Party system dynamics; Political parties; Portugal | ABSTRACT: This chapter analyses patronage in contemporary Portugal.

Third, and related, this chapter further specifies the dependent variable of patronage. The departure point is a neo-institutional one, that the nature of patronage in Portugal is unlikely to remain unaffected by changes in the country's institutional context. As such, it assesses not only the practice of patronage but also its scope, logic, and style, in order to better understand how democratization, the evolving nature of the Portuguese state and bureaucracy, as well as its parties and party system dynamics, have potentially impacted on the nature of patronage in Portugal.""]"

New detailed geologic mapping, macro- and microstructural data, and zircon geo/thermochronology reveal insight into the structural evolution of the southern portion of the Paposo fault. The core of the Paposo fault is defined by a ~50 m-thick zone of illite-rich gouge that dips steeply ESE and juxtaposes fractured but unfoliated Early Jurassic tonalite west of the fault against mylonitic Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous granitoids east of the fault. The mylonite zone east of the fault is ~0.7–1 km thick and includes a ~100–500 m-thick band of hydrothermally-altered ultramylonite derived from Latest Jurassic (146.5 ± 1.5 Ma) to Early Cretaceous (138.5 ± 1.6 Ma) granodiorite. West of this ultramylonite zone, a ~150–350 m-thick zone of younger tonalite (136.0 ± 1.8 Ma) parallels the Paposo fault and grades from protomylonite to mylonite <10 m from the gouge zone on its western margin. Mylonitic foliations dip steeply to moderately SE with lineations that typically plunge ~10–30° SW. Most SE-dipping mylonitic fabrics record oblique sinistral-reverse shear that is consistent with the overall pattern of small-scale brittle faults and S-C-C’ fabrics in the Paposo fault gouge zone. However, in several parts of the hydrothermally-altered mylonite zone, symmetric microstructures and S > L tectonite fabrics most likely record a significant component of zone-normal flattening. The upper age limit of deformation is constrained to be younger than the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous granodiorite. Hydrothermal alteration and development of high-strain zones in the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous granodiorite are locally associated with mafic dikes that do not cut the younger protomylonitic tonalite, indicating that most of the hydrothermal alteration and mylonitic strain occurred between ~139 Ma and 136 Ma. The Paposo fault gouge zone formed between 150 °C and 200 °C based on clay mineralogy and the illite Kübler index. The timing of gouge formation most likely overlaps with cooling below ~180–190 °C recorded by a zircon (U-Th)/He date of 116.6 ± 6.2 Ma from the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous granodiorite. Together these data constrain brittle and ductile deformation to the Early Cretaceous, similar to the age of deformation along other segments of the AFS and coeval with co-spatial arc magmatism. Regionally, the Paposo segment of the AFS is arcuate, trending NNW-SSE in the northern end and NNE-SSW in the southern end. Previous studies of fault strands along the northern portion of the Paposo segment document sinistral transtension, whereas oblique sinistral-reverse shear and local coaxial flattening record sinistral transpression along the southern portion of the Paposo fault. We propose that transtension and transpression along the AFS are controlled by the arcuate geometry, and both are compatible with sinistral simple shear along the N-S-trending magmatic arc.', 'TITLE: Along-strike architectural variability of an exhumed crustal-scale seismogenic fault (Bolfin Fault Zone, Atacama Fault System, Chile) | KEYWORDS: Atacama fault system; Earthquakes; Fault structure; Fault zone rocks; Fluid-driven seismicity; Seismogenic faults | ABSTRACT: Fault zone architecture and its internal structural variability play a pivotal role in earthquake mechanics, by controlling, for instance, the nucleation, propagation and arrest of individual seismic ruptures and the evolution in space and time of foreshock and aftershock seismic sequences. Nevertheless, the along-strike architectural variability of crustal-scale seismogenic sources over regional distances is still poorly investigated. Here, we describe the architectural variability of the >40-km-long exhumed, seismogenic Bolfin Fault Zone (BFZ) of the intra-arc Atacama Fault System (Northern Chile). The BFZ cuts through plutonic rocks of the Mesozoic Coastal Cordillera and was seismically active at 5–7 km depth and ≤ 300 °C in a fluid-rich environment. The BFZ includes multiple altered fault core strands, consisting of chlorite-rich cataclasites-ultracataclasites and pseudotachylytes, surrounded by chlorite-rich protobreccias to protocataclasites over a zone up to 60-m-thick. These fault rocks are embedded within a low-strain damage zone, up to 150-m-thick, which includes strongly altered volumes of dilatational hydrothermal breccias and clusters of epidote-rich fault-vein networks at the linkage of the BFZ with subsidiary faults. The strong hydrothermal alteration of rocks along both the fault core and the damage zone attests to an extensive percolation of fluids across all the elements of the structural network during the activity of the entire fault zone. In particular, we interpret the epidote-rich fault-vein networks and associated breccias as an exhumed example of upper-crustal fluid-driven earthquake swarms, similar to the presently active intra-arc Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault System (Southern Andean Volcanic Zone, Chile).', 'TITLE: Structural Evolution of a Crustal-Scale Seismogenic Fault in a Magmatic Arc: The Bolfin Fault Zone (Atacama Fault System) | KEYWORDS: Atacama Fault System; fault growth; intra-arc deformation; pseudotachylytes; seismogenic fault; structural inheritance | ABSTRACT: How major crustal-scale seismogenic faults nucleate and evolve in crystalline basements represents a long-standing, but poorly understood, issue in structural geology and fault mechanics. Here, we address the spatio-temporal evolution of the Bolfin Fault Zone (BFZ), a >40-km-long exhumed seismogenic splay fault of the 1000-km-long strike-slip Atacama Fault System. The BFZ has a sinuous fault trace across the Mesozoic magmatic arc of the Coastal Cordillera (Northern Chile) and formed during the oblique subduction of the Aluk plate beneath the South American plate. Seismic faulting occurred at 5–7 km depth and ≤ 300°C in a fluid-rich environment as recorded by extensive propylitic alteration and epidote-chlorite veining. Ancient (125–118 Ma) seismicity is attested by the widespread occurrence of pseudotachylytes. Field geologic surveys indicate nucleation of the BFZ on precursory geometrical anisotropies represented by magmatic foliation of plutons (northern and central segments) and andesitic dyke swarms (southern segment) within the heterogeneous crystalline basement. Seismic faulting exploited the segments of precursory anisotropies that were optimal to favorably oriented with respect to the long-term far-stress field associated with the oblique ancient subduction. The large-scale sinuous geometry of the BFZ resulted from the hard linkage of these anisotropy-pinned segments during fault growth.']"

In particular, pH-responsive silica nanocarriers have been studied to provide controlled drug delivery in acidic tumor microenvironments. However, the intracellular microenvironment that the nanosystem must face has an impact on the anticancer effect; therefore, the design of the nanocarrier and the mechanisms that govern drug release play a crucial role in optimizing efficacy. Here, we synthesized and characterized mesoporous silica nanoparticles with transferrin conjugated on their surface via a pH-sensitive imine bond (MSN-Tf) to assess camptothecin (CPT) loading and release. The results showed that CPT-loaded MSN-Tf (MSN-Tf@CPT) had a size of ca. 90 nm, a zeta potential of −18.9 mV, and a loaded content of 13.4%. The release kinetic data best fit a first-order model, and the predominant mechanism was Fickian diffusion.

For this, a gatekeeper is usually used, thus avoiding unwanted leakage at pH 7.4, while modulating the release under more acidic pH conditions in the tumor cell microenvironment. To optimize the efficiency of these nanostructures, it is crucial to study the release kinetics of anticancer drugs, predict their behavior, and modify the transport process mechanism. In the present study, we synthesized and characterized two types of pH-responsive mesoporous silica nanocarriers, which have transferrin conjugates on the surface serving as a gatekeeper. One nanocarrier was a conventional mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) with transferrin attached through a pH-sensitive linker (MSN-Tf), while the other had a pH-sensitive diimine bridge in its framework, giving it degradable characteristic (dMSN-Tf). The use of conventional mathematical models and a three-parameter model that considers the drug-matrix interaction allowed the evaluation and elucidation of the different mechanisms involved in the kinetics of doxorubicin release from both materials at pH 7.4 and pH 5.0. The change in the kinetics of doxorubicin release from zero-order to first-order when it is in a degradable system such as dMSN-Tf, can be very useful for rapid drug delivery in acidic media such as inside cancer cells. Cell viability experiments in lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299, showed enhanced anticancer activity by the nanomaterial with the pH-sensitive framework compared to the material that has a pH-sensitive linker. Overall, these findings provide important insights for optimizing the delivery of anticancer drugs.', 'TITLE: Limitations and opportunities in topical drug delivery: Interaction between silica nanoparticles and skin barrier | KEYWORDS: Nanocarriers; Nanomedicines; Silica nanoparticles; Skin delivery; Skin disorders; Topical delivery | ABSTRACT: The first limiting barrier for the transport in the skin is the stratum corneum; different strategies have been developed to overcome this barrier, including chemical enhancers. However, these penetration enhancers have limitations, including toxic adverse effects. In this context, research into nanomaterials has provided new tools to increase the residence time of drugs by generating a reservoir, increasing the specificity of drugs and reducing their adverse effects, and improving the penetration of drugs that are difficult to formulate. Silica nanoparticles have been proposed as suitable nanocarriers for skin delivery. Unfortunately, the mechanisms involved in the interaction, transport and fate of silica nanoparticles in the skin have not been fully investigated. This paper reviews significant findings about the interaction between silica-based nanocarriers and the skin. First, this review focuses on the properties and functions of the skin, the skin penetration properties of silica nanoparticles, their synthesis strategies and their toxicity. Finally, advances and evidence on the application of silica nanocarriers in skin drug delivery are provided, in which the use of nanoparticles increases the stability and solubility of the bioactive compound, enhancing its performance, act as penetrator enhancer and improving controlled release.

In this letter, we characterize the polarization reversal of an 8 nm-thick HZO film deposited by the atomic layer deposition with voltage pulses varying in amplitude (0.8-2 V) and duration (200 ns-7.6 ms). We show that the measurements are well described by a nucleation limited switching model, which enables extraction of the minimum switching time and the probability distribution of local electric field variations in the polycrystalline film. The close model fit spanning 5 orders of magnitude in pulse duration indicates the applicability of this model to HZO.

In this work, we provide new insights into multi and few-domain ferroelectric switching dynamics that highlight the possibility of achieving steep-slope non-hysteretic ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) from internal voltage amplification and channel charge boost (Fig. 1) [2]. Our proposed modeling framework is built upon the interaction of the electric-dipoles with the local electric field, thereby accounting for the intrinsic positive feedback mechanism due to dipolar-interaction (Fig. 2) [3]. This approach, while equivalent to the previous free energy-landscape based analysis, gives new insights about the system's dynamic response by conceptually separating the switching dynamics dictated by the physics of the device from the effects added by the external circuital topology. To capture the intrinsic ferroelectric dynamics, we translate the Landau-Khalatnikov (LK) equations to an equivalent circuit model with a positive feedback loop and utilize a capacitor in series (CS) that provides a negative feedback loop. Analyzing the interplay of both feedbacks loops, we can explain our experimental data obtained from a stack of 10nm thick Hf0.5Zr0.5O ferroelectric capacitor and a varying linear dielectric capacitor in series and show how negative capacitance (NC) region is accessed and stabilized. Finally, we show how using this framework it is possible to tune the system parameters to generate a steep slope hysteresis free Ferroelectric Transistor (FeFET) due to the interval node voltage amplification and charge boost provided by the switching of the ferroelectric microscopic domains.""]"

Our first finding was that angiotensin-(1–9) can induce mitochondrial fusion through DRP1 phosphorylation. Secondly, angiotensin-(1–9) blocked mitochondrial fission and intracellular calcium dysregulation in a model of norepinephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, preventing the activation of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. To further investigate angiotensin-(1–9) anti-hypertrophic mechanism, we performed RNA-seq studies, identifying the upregulation of miR-129 under angiotensin-(1–9) treatment. miR-129 decreased the transcript levels of the protein kinase A inhibitor (PKIA), resulting in the activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway.

This problem consists in the description of the dynamics of an infinitesimal mass particle attracted by two primaries with identical masses, rotating with constant angular velocity in a fixed parallel of radius a ∈ (0, 1). It is verified that both poles of S2 are equilibrium points for any value of the parameter a. This problem is modeled through a Hamiltonian system of two degrees of freedom depending on the parameter a. Using results concerning nonlinear stability, the type of Lyapunov stability (nonlinear) is provided for the polar equilibria, according to the resonances.

This problem consists in the study of the dynamics of an infinitesimal mass particle attracted by N primaries of identical masses describing elliptic relative equilibria of the N-body problem on Mκ2, i.e., a solution where the primaries are rotating uniformly with constant angular velocity ω on a fixed parallel of S2 or H2 and placed at the vertices of a regular polygon. In a rotating frame, this problem yields a two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system. The goal of this paper is to describe analytically some dynamics features for κ=±1. Precisely, we study the relative location of equilibria, obtaining, in particular, that the poles of S2 and vertex of H2 represent equilibrium points for any value of the parameters. Thus, analysis of the nonlinear stability of these equilibria is carried out, as well as two types of bifurcations are detected: Hamiltonian-Hopf and N-bifurcation. Additionally, we prove the existence of a family of Hill's orbits and a family of periodic orbits when the primaries are located near the poles of S2 or the vertex of H2.

What are the dark matter and dark energy that seem to constitute 95% of the energy density of the Universe? Do we need extensions to the standard model of particle physics and fundamental interactions? Is the ΛCDM cosmological scenario correct, or are we missing an essential piece of the puzzle? In this paper, we list the requirements for a future CMB polarisation survey addressing these scientific objectives, and discuss the design drivers of the COREmfive space mission proposed to ESA in answer to the ""M5"" call for a medium-sized mission. The rationale and options, and the methodologies used to assess the mission\'s performance, are of interest to other future CMB mission design studies. COREmfive has 19 frequency channels, distributed over a broad frequency range, spanning the 60-600 GHz interval, to control astrophysical foreground emission. The angular resolution ranges from 2′ to 18′, and the aggregate CMB sensitivity is about 2 μKċarcmin. The observations are made with a single integrated focal-plane instrument, consisting of an array of 2100 cryogenically-cooled, linearly-polarised detectors at the focus of a 1.2-m aperture cross-Dragone telescope. The mission is designed to minimise all sources of systematic effects, which must be controlled so that no more than 10-4 of the intensity leaks into polarisation maps, and no more than about 1% of E-type polarisation leaks into B-type modes. COREmfive observes the sky from a large Lissajous orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point on an orbit that offers stable observing conditions and avoids contamination from sidelobe pick-up of stray radiation originating from the Sun, Earth, and Moon. The entire sky is observed repeatedly during four years of continuous scanning, with a combination of three rotations of the spacecraft over different timescales. With about 50% of the sky covered every few days, this scan strategy provides the mitigation of systematic effects and the internal redundancy that are needed to convincingly extract the primordial B-mode signal on large angular scales, and check with adequate sensitivity the consistency of the observations in several independent data subsets. COREmfive is designed as a ""near-ultimate"" CMB polarisation mission which, for optimal complementarity with ground-based observations, will perform the observations that are known to be essential to CMB polarisation science and cannot be obtained by any other means than a dedicated space mission. It will provide well-characterised, highly-redundant multi-frequency observations of polarisation at all the scales where foreground emission and cosmic variance dominate the final uncertainty for obtaining precision CMB science, as well as 2′ angular resolution maps of high-frequency foreground emission in the 300-600 GHz frequency range, essential for complementarity with future ground-based observations with large telescopes that can observe the CMB with the same beamsize.', 'TITLE: Exploring cosmic origins with CORE: Gravitational lensing of the CMB | KEYWORDS: CMBR polarization; gravitational lensing; ination; neutrino masses from cosmology | ABSTRACT: Lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is now a well-developed probe of the clustering of the large-scale mass distribution over a broad range of redshifts. By exploiting the non-Gaussian imprints of lensing in the polarization of the CMB, the CORE mission will allow production of a clean map of the lensing deflections over nearly the full-sky. The number of high-S/N modes in this map will exceed current CMB lensing maps by a factor of 40, and the measurement will be sample-variance limited on all scales where linear theory is valid. Here, we summarise this mission product and discuss the science that will follow from its power spectrum and the cross-correlation with other clustering data. For example, the summed mass of neutrinos will be determined to an accuracy of 17 meV combining CORE lensing and CMB two-point information with contemporaneous measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature in the clustering of galaxies, three times smaller than the minimum total mass allowed by neutrino oscillation measurements. Lensing has applications across many other science goals of CORE, including the search for B-mode polarization from primordial gravitational waves. Here, lens-induced B-modes will dominate over instrument noise, limiting constraints on the power spectrum amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. With lensing reconstructed by CORE, one can ""delens"" the observed polarization internally, reducing the lensing B-mode power by 60 %. This can be improved to 70 % by combining lensing and measurements of the cosmic infrared background from CORE, leading to an improvement of a factor of 2.5 in the error on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves compared to no delensing (in the null hypothesis of no primordial B-modes). Lensing measurements from CORE will allow calibration of the halo masses of the tens of thousands of galaxy clusters that it will find, with constraints dominated by the clean polarization-based estimators. The 19 frequency channels proposed for CORE will allow accurate removal of Galactic emission from CMB maps. We present initial findings that show that residual Galactic foreground contamination will not be a significant source of bias for lensing power spectrum measurements with CORE.', 'TITLE: Exploring cosmic origins with CORE: B-mode component separation | KEYWORDS: CMBR experiments; cosmological parameters from CMBR; gravitational waves and CMBR polarization; inflation | ABSTRACT: We demonstrate that, for the baseline design of the CORE satellite mission, the polarized foregrounds can be controlled at the level required to allow the detection of the primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization with the desired accuracy at both reionization and recombination scales, for tensor-to-scalar ratio values of r 5× 10-3. We consider detailed sky simulations based on state-of-the-art CMB observations that consist of CMB polarization with τ=0.055 and tensor-to-scalar values ranging from r=10-2 to 10-3, Galactic synchrotron, and thermal dust polarization with variable spectral indices over the sky, polarized anomalous microwave emission, polarized infrared and radio sources, and gravitational lensing effects. Using both parametric and blind approaches, we perform full component separation and likelihood analysis of the simulations, allowing us to quantify both uncertainties and biases on the reconstructed primordial B-modes. Under the assumption of perfect control of lensing effects, CORE would measure an unbiased estimate of r=(5 ± 0.4)× 10-3 after foreground cleaning. In the presence of both gravitational lensing effects and astrophysical foregrounds, the significance of the detection is lowered, with CORE achieving a 4σ-measurement of r=5× 10-3 after foreground cleaning and 60% delensing. For lower tensor-to-scalar ratios (r=10-3) the overall uncertainty on r is dominated by foreground residuals, not by the 40% residual of lensing cosmic variance. Moreover, the residual contribution of unprocessed polarized point-sources can be the dominant foreground contamination to primordial B-modes at this r level, even on relatively large angular scales, ℓ ∼ 50. Finally, we report two sources of potential bias for the detection of the primordial B-modes by future CMB experiments: (i) the use of incorrect foreground models, e.g. a modelling error of Δβs = 0.02 on the synchrotron spectral indices may result in an excess in the recovered reionization peak corresponding to an effective Δ r > 10-3; (ii) the average of the foreground line-of-sight spectral indices by the combined effects of pixelization and beam convolution, which adds an effective curvature to the foreground spectral energy distribution and may cause spectral degeneracies with the CMB in the frequency range probed by the experiment.']"

At smaller scales, oceanic submesoscale currents (SMCs; 0.1–10 km) have a major influence on the ocean’s energy budget, variability, and ecosystems. However, submesoscale air–sea interactions are not well understood because of observational and modeling limitations related to their scales. Here, we use a realistic submesoscale-permitting coupled oceanic and atmospheric model to quantify the spatiotemporal variability of TFB and CFB coupling in the northwest tropical Atlantic Ocean. While CFB still acts as a submesoscale eddy killer by inducing an energy sink from the SMCs to the atmosphere, it appears to be more efficient at the submesoscale by approximately 30% than at the mesoscale. Submesoscale CFB affects the surface stress, however, the finite time scale of SMCs for adjusting the atmospheric boundary layer results in a diminished low-level wind response, weakening partial ocean reenergization by about 70%. Unlike at the mesoscale, submesoscale CFB induces stress/wind convergence/divergence, influencing the atmospheric boundary layer through vertical motions. The linear relationship between the surface stress derivative or wind derivative fields and sea surface temperature gradients, widespread at the mesoscale, decreases by approximately 35% 6 7% or 77% 6 10%, respectively, at the submesoscale. In addition, submesoscale TFB induces turbulent heat fluxes comparable to those at the mesoscale. Seasonal variability in meso-and submesoscale CFB and TFB coupling is mostly related to background wind speed. Also, disentangling submesoscale CFB and TFB is challenging because they can reinforce or counteract each other.']"

In cattle, brucellosis is almost invariably caused by Brucella abortus. Live, attenuated Brucella vaccines are commonly used to prevent illness in cattle, but can cause abortions in pregnant animals. It is, therefore, desirable to design an effective and safer vaccine against Brucella. We have used specific Brucella antigens that induce immunity and protection against B. abortus. A novel recombinant multi-epitope DNA vaccine specific for brucellosis was developed. To design the vaccine construct, we employed bioinformatics tools to predict epitopes present in Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and in the open reading frames of the genomic island-3 (BAB1_0260, BAB1_0270, BAB1_0273, and BAB1_0278) of Brucella. We successfully designed a multi-epitope DNA plasmid vaccine chimera that encodes and expresses 21 epitopes. This DNA vaccine induced a specific humoral and cellular immune response in BALB/c mice. It induced a typical T-helper 1 response, eliciting production of immunoglobulin G2a and IFN-γ particularly associated with the Th1 cell subset of CD4+ T cells. The production of IL-4, an indicator of Th2 activation, was not detected in splenocytes. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the vaccine induced a predominantly Th1 response.

The molar ratio of reactants and the synthesis temperature were screened to find optimum synthesis conditions leading to the highest toughness enhancement of PLA. It was found that a molar ratio of reactants of 1:1 glycerol/succinic acid increases the effectiveness of PGS as a toughening agent for PLA, which correlates with the achievement of a higher molecular weight on the synthesis of PGS. The introduction of maleic anhydride as a comonomer for the synthesis of the partial replacement of succinic acid was advantageous for making PGS suitable for reactive extrusion (REX) mediated by free radical initiators. The tensile toughness of the REX PLA/PGSMA blends was improved by 392% compared with that of neat PLA, which was caused by the simultaneous cross-linking of PGSMA within the PLA matrix, and the in situ formation of PLA-g-PGSMA graft copolymers acting as interfacial compatibilizers. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared analysis confirmed the formation of PLA-g-PGSMA species on REX experiments. This in turn caused a decrease in the diameter of the PGS particles dispersed within the PLA matrix from >10 μm to approximately 2 μm as observed using scanning electron microscopy. A further increase of 1600% in the toughness of the blends was achieved by lowering the synthesis temperature of PGSMA from 180 to 150 °C. The optimum synthesis conditions for PGSMA leading to the highest increase in the toughness of 80/20 PLA/PGSMA blends were found to be 1:0.5:0.5 mol glycerol/succinic acid/maleic anhydride synthesized at a temperature of 150 °C for 5 h.', ""TITLE: Blends based on amino acid functionalized poly (ethylene-alt-maleic anhydride) polyelectrolytes and PEO for nanofiber elaboration: Biocompatible and angiogenic polyelectrolytes | KEYWORDS: Amino acid; Angiogenic; Biomaterial; Nanofibers; Polyelectrolytes | ABSTRACT: A wide variety of polymers have been electrospun to obtain nanofibers.

These compounds may be designated as chalcocoumarins (3-cinnamoyl-2H-chromen-2-ones). Both chalcones and coumarins are recognized scaffolds in medicinal chemistry, showing diverse biological and pharmacological properties among which neuro-protective activities and multiple enzyme inhibition, including mitochondrial enzyme systems, stand out. The evaluation of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors has aroused considerable interest as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s. Of the fourteen chalcocumarins evaluated here against MAO-B, ChC4 showed the strongest activity in vitro, with IC50 = 0.76 ± 0.08 µM. Computational docking, molecular dynamics and MM/GBSA studies, confirm that ChC4 binds very stably to the active rMAO-B site, explaining the experimental inhibition data.', 'TITLE: Betulinic Acid ω-Triphenylphosphonium Alkyl Esters: Antiproliferative Activities and In Silico Pharmacokinetic Profiles | KEYWORDS: antiproliferative activities; betulinic acid derivatives; cancer; drugs discovery; natural products; synthetic strategy | ABSTRACT: Background: Betulinic acid (BA) and some derivatives are well-known antiproliferative compounds.

Aim: To determine the proportion of P. aeruginosa isolates, resistant to imipenem and/or meropenem, producing carbapenemases, the type of enzyme produced and the genetic relationship between the isolates. Methods: One hundred and thirteen resistant to at least one carbapenem isolates, obtained in 12 hospitals and 9 cities in Chile were studied. Additionally, susceptibility to ceftazidime, amikacin, gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin and colistin was determined. Carba NP was performed and in the positive isolates carbapenemase genes were detected by PCR. The isolates were typified by restriction with SpeI and PFGE. Results: Not all isolates produce carbapenemases, and only in 61/113 of them (54%) the blaKPC (32) or blaVIM (29) was amplified. In none of the isolates was found the coharboring of both genes. The pulso types indicated no clonal dissemination of the isolates, evidencing an important genetic diversity. Conclusions: P. aeruginosa isolates producing carbapenemases, obtained in Chilean hospitals carry blaKPC and blaVIM genes and, mostly, are polyclonal. These results emphasize the importance of carrying out epidemiological studies with a greater number of isolates to allow a better understanding of the epidemiology of carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa in Chile.', 'TITLE: Characterization and Abundance of Plasmid-Dependent Alphatectivirus Bacteriophages | KEYWORDS: Antimicrobial resistance; Bacteria; Bacteriophages; Conjugation; Horizontal gene transfer; Plasmid; Virus | ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat, exacerbated by the ability of bacteria to rapidly disseminate antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG). Since conjugative plasmids of the incompatibility group P (IncP) are ubiquitous mobile genetic elements that often carry ARG and are broad-host-range, they are important targets to prevent the dissemination of AMR. Plasmid-dependent phages infect plasmid-carrying bacteria by recognizing components of the conjugative secretion system as receptors. We sought to isolate plasmid-dependent phages from wastewater using an avirulent strain of Salmonella enterica carrying the conjugative IncP plasmid pKJK5. Irrespective of the site, we only obtained bacteriophages belonging to the genus Alphatectivirus. Eleven isolates were sequenced, their genomes analyzed, and their host range established using S. enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas putida carrying diverse conjugative plasmids. We confirmed that Alphatectivirus are abundant in domestic and hospital wastewater using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. However, these results are not consistent with their low or undetectable occurrence in metagenomes. Therefore, overall, our results emphasize the importance of performing phage isolation to uncover diversity, especially considering the potential of plasmid-dependent phages to reduce the spread of ARG carried by conjugative plasmids, and to help combat the AMR crisis.', 'TITLE: Isolation and Characterization of Lytic Bacteriophages Capable of Infecting Diverse Multidrug-Resistant Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: PaCCP1 and PaCCP2 | KEYWORDS: antimicrobial resistance; bacteria; bacteriophages; P. aeruginosa; virus; wastewater | ABSTRACT: Background/Objectives: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat, which is exacerbated by the lack of new antibiotics and the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) superbugs. Comprehensive efforts and alternative strategies to combat AMR are urgently needed to prevent social, medical, and economic consequences. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen responsible for a wide range of infections, from soft tissue infections to life-threatening conditions such as bacteremia and pneumonia. Bacteriophages have been considered as a potential therapeutic option to treat bacterial infections. Our aim was to isolate phages able to infect MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Methods: We isolated two lytic phages, using the conventional double layer agar technique (DLA), from samples obtained from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant in Concepción, Chile. The phages, designated as PaCCP1 and PaCCP2, were observed by electron microscopy and their host range was determined against multiple P. aeruginosa strains using DLA. Moreover, their genomes were sequenced and analyzed. Results: Phage PaCCP1 is a member of the Septimatrevirus genus and phage PaCCP2 is a member of the Pbunavirus genus. Both phages are tailed and contain dsDNA. The genome of PaCCP1 is 43,176 bp in length with a GC content of 54.4%, encoding 59 ORFs, one of them being a tRNA gene. The genome of PaCCP2 is 66,333 bp in length with a GC content of 55.6%, encoding 102 non-tRNA ORFs. PaCCP1 is capable of infecting five strains of P. aeruginosa, whereas phage PaCCP2 is capable of infecting three strains of P. aeruginosa. Both phages do not contain bacterial virulence or AMR genes and contain three and six putative Anti-CRISPR proteins. Conclusions: Phages PaCCP1 and PaCCP2 show promise as effective treatments for MDR P. aeruginosa strains, offering a potential strategy for controlling this clinically important pathogen through phage therapy.']"

Indeed, brain complications associated with preeclampsia are the leading direct causes of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality, especially in low-and middle-income countries. In addition to the well-recognized long-Term adverse cardiovascular effects of preeclampsia, women who have had preeclampsia have higher risk of stroke, dementia, intracerebral white matter lesions, epilepsy, and perhaps also cognitive decline postpartum. Furthermore, increasing evidence has also associated preeclampsia with similar cognitive and cerebral disorders in the offspring. However, the mechanistic links between these associations remain unresolved.

These data were confirmed using 2 additional PELS models. Furthermore, circulating levels of critical proangiogenic factors, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), and PlGF (placental growth factor) were lower in postnatal day 5 PELS. Also we found lower VEGF receptor 2 (KDR [kinase insert domain-containing receptor]) levels in mice and human endothelial cells exposed to the serum of postnatal day 5 PELS or fetal plasma of preeclamptic pregnancies, respectively. These changes were associated with lower in vitro angiogenic capacity, diminished cell migration, larger F-actin filaments, lower number of filopodia, and lower protein levels of F-actin polymerization regulators in brain endothelial cells exposed to serum or fetal plasma of offspring from preeclampsia.

This article introduces guidelines development and implementation processes and it reviews the Chilean experience. The main stages in a CPG development are question formulation, search and analysis of the existing evidence related to those questions, and making judgments about that evidence in order to formulate recommendations for clinical practice. At the national level, guidelines development processes are conducted by the Ministry of Health, and even when recent evaluations show some good results, there are a number of aspects - such as applicability - that should be improved. On the other hand, CPG should be implemented using effective strategies in order to obtain changes in clinical practice and patients\' outcomes. The existing evidence about the effects of the different implementation strategies shows modest and highly variable results.

Nevertheless, there is no specific reporting guidance. The essential Reporting Items of Practice Guidelines in Healthcare (RIGHT) statement could be useful for reporting adapted guidelines, but it does not address all the important aspects of the adaptation process. The objective of our project is to develop an extension of the RIGHT statement for the reporting of adapted guidelines (RIGHT-Ad@pt Checklist).

At each step of the process, we will calculate absolute frequencies and proportions, use content analysis to summarise and draw conclusions, discuss the results, draft a report and refine the checklist. Ethics and dissemination We have obtained a waiver of approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona, Spain). We will disseminate the RIGHT-Ad@pt Checklist by publishing into a peer-reviewed journal, presenting to relevant stakeholders and translating into different languages. We will continuously seek feedback from stakeholders, surveil new relevant evidence and, if necessary, update the checklist.', ""TITLE: A Reporting Tool for Adapted Guidelines in Health Care: The RIGHT-Ad@pt Checklist | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Background: Adaptation of existing guidelines can be an efficient way to develop contextualized recommendations.

Membrane processes have been recently proposed as an alternative for microalgae concentration. During this research, membrane concentration of non-axenic cultures of saline microalga Nannochloropsis gaditana and freshwater Chlorella sorokiniana was evaluated by a series of batch filtration tests, using tubular ultrafiltration membranes.

Surface response methodology was also used to determine the effect of cross-flow velocity and biomass concentration over critical flux. Results indicate that exposure of the microalgae culture to cross-flow conditions for long periods may affect suspension properties, decreasing particle size, affecting permeate flux.

In this work, we focus on the problem of generating conference programs that organize talks into tracks: subevents within the conference that are group-related talks. The main contributions of this work can be organized into three scopes: literature review, problem formulation and benchmarking, and heuristic approach. We provide a literature review of conference scheduling approaches that organizes these approaches within a timetabling problem taxonomy. We also describe the main characteristics of the conference scheduling approaches in the literature and propose a classification scheme for such works. To study the scheduling of conferences that include tracks, we introduce the definition of the track-based conference scheduling problem, a new problem that incorporates tracks in the conference program. We provide a binary integer linear programming model formulation for this problem. Our formulation considers the availability of presenters, chairs, and organizers, the avoidance of parallel tracks, and best paper sessions, among other classical constraints of conference scheduling problems. Additionally, based on our formulation, we propose a simple instance-generation procedure that we apply to generate a set of artificial instances. We complete our work by proposing a heuristic method based on the simulated annealing metaheuristic for solving the track-based conference scheduling problem. We compare the results obtained by our heuristic approach and the Gurobi solver regarding execution time and solution quality. The results show that the proposed heuristic method is a practical approach for tackling the problem as it obtains solutions in a fraction of the time required by Gurobi, while Gurobi is also unable to obtain an optimal solution in the defined time for a subset of the instances. Finally, from a general perspective, this work provides a new conference scheduling problem formulation that can be extended in the future to include other features common in conference programs. Moreover, thanks to the instance generation procedure, this formulation can be used as a benchmark for designing and comparing new solving approaches.', 'TITLE: Splitting versus setup trade-offs for scheduling to minimize weighted completion time | KEYWORDS: Scheduling; Split jobs; Weighted completion time | ABSTRACT: We study scheduling problems when jobs can be split and a setup is required before processing each part, to minimize the weighted sum of completion times. Using a simple splitting strategy and a reduction to an orders scheduling problem we derive a 2-approximation algorithm for the case with uniform weights and setups, improving upon previous work. We extend this idea to the general identical machine case and conclude by designing a constant factor approximation algorithm when machines are unrelated.', 'TITLE: Split scheduling with uniform setup times | KEYWORDS: Approximation algorithms; Complexity theory; Job splitting; Scheduling; Setup times | ABSTRACT: We study a scheduling problem in which jobs may be split into parts, where the parts of a split job may be processed simultaneously on more than one machine. Each part of a job requires a setup time, however, on the machine where the job part is processed. During setup, a machine cannot process or set up any other job. We concentrate on the basic case in which setup times are job-, machine- and sequence-independent. Problems of this kind were encountered when modelling practical problems in planning disaster relief operations. Our main algorithmic result is a polynomial-time algorithm for minimising total completion time on two parallel identical machines. We argue, why the same problem with three machines is not an easy extension of the two-machine case, leaving the complexity of this case as a tantalising open problem. We give a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the general case with any number of machines and a polynomial-time approximation scheme for a fixed number of machines. For the version with the objective to minimise total weighted completion time, we prove NP-hardness. Finally, we conclude with an overview of the state of the art for other split scheduling problems with job-, machine- and sequence-independent setup times.']"

These events promote synaptic dysfunction and loss, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits. Astrocytes are intimately associated with synapses and become activated under pathological conditions, becoming neurotoxic and detrimentally affecting synapses. Although it has been established that reducing neuronal tau expression prevents amyloid-beta-induced toxicity, the role of astrocytic tau in this setting remains understudied. Herein, we performed a series of astrocytic and neuronal primary cultures to evaluate the effects of decreasing astrocytic tau levels on astrocyte-mediated amyloid-beta-induced synaptic degeneration. Our results suggest that the downregulation of tau in astrocytes mitigates the loss of synapses triggered by their exposure to amyloid-beta. Additionally, the absence of tau from astrocytes promotes the upregulation of several synaptoprotective genes, followed by increased production of the neuroprotective factor Pentraxin 3. These results expand our understanding of the contribution of astrocytic tau to the neurodegenerative process induced by amyloid-beta-stimulation and how reducing astrocytic tau could improve astrocyte function by stimulating the expression of synaptoprotective factors. Reducing endogenous astrocytic tau expression could be a potential strategy to prevent synaptic damage in Alzheimer's disease and other neurological conditions."", ""TITLE: Tau depletion diminishes vascular amyloid-related deficits in a mouse model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy | KEYWORDS: cerebral amyloid angiopathy; neuroinflammation; tau; vascular amyloid | ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Tau is essential for amyloid beta (Aβ)–induced synaptic and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), making its downregulation a therapeutic target. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a major vascular contributor to cognitive decline, affects over 90% of patients with AD. This study explores the impact of tau downregulation on CAA pathogenesis. METHODS: We crossed the Familial Danish Dementia mouse model (Tg-FDD), which develops vascular amyloid, with tau-null (mTau−/−) mice to generate a CAA model lacking endogenous tau (Tg-FDD/mTau−/−). Behavioral, electrophysiological, histological, and transcriptomic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Tau depletion ameliorated motor and synaptic impairments, reduced vascular amyloid deposition, and prevented vascular damage. Tau ablation also mitigated astrocytic reactivity and neuroinflammation associated with vascular amyloid accumulation. CONCLUSION: These findings provide the first in vivo evidence of the beneficial effects of tau downregulation in a CAA mouse model, supporting tau reduction as a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with parenchymal and vascular amyloid deposition. Highlights: Tau ablation improves motor function and synaptic impair, reduces cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, and prevents vascular damage in a mouse model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Tau reduction decreases astrocytic reactivity, alters neuroinflammatory gene expression, and enhances oligodendrocyte function, suggesting a protective role against neuroinflammation in CAA. These findings highlight tau reduction as a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate CAA-induced pathogenesis, with implications for treating patients with both parenchymal and vascular amyloid deposition."", 'TITLE: Network analysis identifies strain-dependent response to tau and tau seeding-associated genes | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Previous research demonstrated that genetic heterogeneity is a critical factor in modeling amyloid accumulation and other Alzheimer’s disease phenotypes. However, it is unknown what mechanisms underlie these effects of genetic background on modeling tau aggregate-driven pathogenicity. In this study, we induced tau aggregation in wild-derived mice by expressing MAPT. To investigate the effect of genetic background on the action of tau aggregates, we performed RNA sequencing with brains of C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ mice (n = 64) and determined core transcriptional signature conserved in all genetic backgrounds and signature unique to wild-derived backgrounds. By measuring tau seeding activity using the cortex, we identified 19 key genes associated with tau seeding and amyloid response. Interestingly, microglial pathways were strongly associated with tau seeding activity in CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ backgrounds. Collectively, our study demonstrates that mouse genetic context affects tau-mediated alteration of transcriptome and tau seeding. The gene modules associated with tau seeding provide an important resource to better model tauopathy.']"

Different studies have demonstrated that human-induced fire ignitions can account for more than 90 % of forest fires, so human co-existence with wildfires requires informed decision making via preventive policies in order to minimize risk and adapt to new conditions. In this paper, we address the multidimensional effects of three groups of drivers (human activity, geographic and topographic, and land cover) that can be managed to assist in territorial planning under fire risk. We found critical factors of strong interactions with the potential to increase the likelihood of starting a fire. Our solution approach included the application of a Machine Learning method called Random Undersampling and Boosting (RUSBoost) to assess risk (fire occurrence probability), which was subsequently accompanied by a sensitivity analysis that revealed interactions of various levels of risk. The prediction performance of the proposed model was assessed using several statistical measures such as the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The results confirmed the high accuracy of our model, with an AUC of 0.967 and an overall accuracy over test data of 93.01 % after applying a Bayesian approach for hyper-parameter optimization.

Wildland fires are often initiated by small spot ignition sources and then spread to larger burning areas. Methods: Experiments are conducted for the spotting ignition of a forest surface fuel (pine needles) in a relatively large (up to 1 m2), horizontal laboratory bed, and the subsequent fire spread without wind. The spotting ignition sources are a cluster of steel particles, an ember and a small pilot flame. Key results and conclusions: Wildfire spread has an initial acceleration phase, with the growth of the burned area in the fuel bed following a power law dependence in time, almost independent of the ignition source. Comparison with previous larger-scale experiments and FARSITE modelling of the fire spread over similar fuel beds shows that the power function with time describes well the combined results of the initial wildfire growth and the transition to larger fire propagation for relatively long times. Implications: The Rothermel equation under different environmental conditions may be extended to describe the initial accelerative growth of a spot fire. This work supports the modelling of fire propagation that currently is geared to a later time in the development of a wildfire.', 'TITLE: On the Growth of Wildland Fires from a Small Ignition Source | KEYWORDS: fire growth; fire model; rate of spread; spot ignition; Wildfire | ABSTRACT: Wildland and Wildland-Urban-Interface (WUI) fires are an important problem that may have major consequences in terms of safety, air quality, and damage to buildings, infrastructure, and the ecosystem. It is expected that with climate change, the wildland fire and WUI fire problem will only intensify. Wildland fires are often initiated by small ignition sources caused either by human intervention (hot metal fragments or burning biomass) or by natural events (lighting or sun heating). Once the wildfire or structural fire has been ignited and grows, it can spread rapidly through ember spotting, where pieces of burning materials are lifted by the plume of the fire and then transported forward by the wind, landing where they can start spot fires downwind. The ignition mechanisms for all of these fires have the common characteristic of a small and localized area of origin, with the subsequent spread of the fire to wider and larger areas. Because of the three-dimensional characteristics of this type of propagating fire, its rate of spread has an initial acceleration phase leading to an equilibrium rate of spread when the fire reaches a certain size, which is referred to as a “line-fire” type of spread. Most of the studies on wildland fire propagation have been conducted with line fires and have been concerned with characterizing the equilibrium rate of spread rather than the initial spread from a small ignition source. In this paper, some of the studies conducted to date on the subject of wildland fire growth from a small ignition source, and the physics supporting the mathematical expressions that are used to describe the growth of the fire are discussed. An attempt is also made to provide support for these works through a more fundamental approach to model the problem.']"

The jet energy scale is measured in events where the jet recoils against a reference object, which can be either a calibrated photon, a reconstructed Z boson, or a system of well-measured small-radius jets. The jet energy resolution and a calibration of forward jets are derived using dijet balance measurements. The jet mass response is measured with two methods: using mass peaks formed by W bosons and top quarks with large transverse momenta and by comparing the jet mass measured using the energy deposited in the calorimeter with that using the momenta of charged-particle tracks. The transverse momentum and mass responses in simulations are found to be about 2–3% higher than in data. This difference is adjusted for with a correction factor. The results of the different methods are combined to yield a calibration over a large range of transverse momenta (pT). The precision of the relative jet energy scale is 1–2% for 200GeV<pT<2TeV, while that of the mass scale is 2–10%.

Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is associated with a high mortality rate and significant neurological, neuropsychological, and neurobehavioral sequelae, which afflict patients for life. Currently, it is unclear whether asymptomatic recurrent reactivations of HSV-1 occur in the central nervous systems in infected people, and if these events could lead to a progressive deterioration of neuronal function. In this context, HSV-1 constitutes an important candidate to be included among the risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease. Our group have demonstrated that HSV-1 triggers neurodegenerative events in in vitro and in vivo induced neuronal infection, evidenced by increase in tau hyperphosphorylation and caspase-3 dependent cleavage of tau protein, resembling what occurs in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in an in vivo model, a reactivation episode during asymptomatic latency of HSV-1 infection in mice was accompanied by upregulation of neuroinflammatory markers (toll-like receptor-4, interferon /β, and p-IRF3). Besides, previous reports have shown that HSV-1 inhibits apoptosis during early infection, but is pro-apoptotic during productive infection. Taking in consideration that the stress sensors AMPK and Sirt1 are involved in neuronal survival and neuroprotection, we hypothesized that HSV-1 could activate the AMPK/Sirt1 axis as a strategy to establish latency through inhibition of apoptosis and restoration of the energy status. Thus, we demonstrated that HSV-1 modulates the AMPK/Sirt1 axis differentially during infection, interfering with pro-apoptotic signaling and regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, pivotal processes in the lifetime of neurons in the central nervous system. In conclusion, our findings support the idea that HSV-1 could contribute to induce neurodegenerative processes in age-associated pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease."", 'TITLE: Tax secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tax detection in plasma of patients with human T-lymphotropic virus-type 1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and asymptomatic carriers | KEYWORDS: Asymptomatic carriers; HAM/TSP patients; HTLV-1; Tax secretion | ABSTRACT: Human T-lymphotropic virus-type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic agent of the neurologic disease HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).

To the precision of these measurements, no atmosphere or rings are detected for either object. The two objects measured here are among the smallest distant objects measured with the stellar occultation technique. In addition to these geometric constraints, the occultation measurements provide astrometric constraints for these two Centaurs at a higher precision than has been feasible by direct imaging. To supplement the occultation results, we also present an analysis of color photometry from the Pan-STARRS surveys to constrain the rotational light curve amplitudes and spectral colors of these two Centaurs. We recommend that future work focus on photometry to more deliberately constrain the objects’ colors and light curve amplitudes and on follow-on occultation efforts informed by this astrometry.', 'TITLE: Stellar occultation by the resonant trans-neptunian object (523764) 2014 WC510reveals a close binary TNO | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: We report on the stellar occultation by (523764) 2014 WC510 observed on 2018 December 1 UT. This occultation campaign was part of the Research and Education Collaborative Occultation Network (RECON), a network of small telescopes spread over 2000 km in western USA and Canada. Light curves from six stations revealed three groups of two or more consecutive flux drops correlated in time between adjacent stations. A Bayesian model comparison reveals that a model with a double object occulting a double star is favored over alternative models considered. For the statistically favored model, we determined that the primary component of the object has a diameter dp = 181 ± 16 km and the secondary ds = 138 ± 32 km, assuming identical geometric albedo between the two components. The two components have a projected separation of 349 ± 26 km. Adopting an absolute magnitude for the system of HV = 7.2 from the Minor Planet Center, we derive a geometric albedo of pV = 5.1% ± 1.7%. This is the smallest resonant object with an occultation size measurement and with a detected secondary from a ground-based stellar occultation, filling a region of the size versus separation parameter space of binary objects that is largely unexplored. The results show the capabilities of the unique design of the RECON experiment sensitive to small objects and close binaries. 2014 WC510 is presently at a low galactic latitude where the high surface density of stars will provide good occultation opportunities in the upcoming years.', 'TITLE: Physical properties of trans-Neptunian object (143707) 2003 UY117 derived from stellar occultation and photometric observations | KEYWORDS: Astrometry; Kuiper belt objects: individual: (143707) 2003 UY117; Methods: observational; Occultations; Techniques: photometric | ABSTRACT: Context. Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are considered to be among the most primitive objects in our Solar System. Knowledge of their primary physical properties is essential for understanding their origin and the evolution of the outer Solar System. In this context, stellar occultations are a powerful and sensitive technique for studying these distant and faint objects. Aims. We aim to obtain the size, shape, absolute magnitude, and geometric albedo for TNO (143707) 2003 UY117. Methods. We predicted a stellar occultation by this TNO for 2020 October 23 UT and ran a specific campaign to investigate this event. We derived the projected profile shape and size from the occultation observations by means of an elliptical fit to the occultation chords. We also performed photometric observations of (143707) 2003 UY117 to obtain the absolute magnitude and the rotational period from the observed rotational light curve. Finally, we combined these results to derive the three-dimensional shape, volume-equivalent diameter, and geometric albedo for this TNO. Results. From the stellar occultation, we obtained a projected ellipse with axes of (282 ± 18) × (184 ± 32) km. The area-equivalent diameter for this ellipse is Deq,A = 228 ± 21 km. From our photometric R band observations, we derived an absolute magnitude of HV = 5.97 ± 0.07 mag using V - R = 0.46 ± 0.07 mag, which was derived from a V band subset of these data. The rotational light curve has a peak-to-valley amplitude of Δm = 0.36 ± 0.13 mag. We find the most likely rotation period to be P = 12.376 ± 0.0033 hours. By combining the occultation with the rotational light curve results and assuming a triaxial ellipsoid, we derived axes of a × b × c = (332 ± 24) km × (216 ± 24) km × (180-24+28) km for this ellipsoid, and therefore a volume-equivalent diameter of Deq,V = 235 ± 25 km. Finally, the values for the absolute magnitude and for the area-equivalent diameter yield a geometric albedo of pV = 0.139 ± 0.027.']"

However, the role of LMWOAs in mobilizing organic phosphorus, which is the predominant phosphorus form in at least half of the world's ecosystems, especially in humid climates, is unclear. The mechanisms of phosphorus mobilization by LMWOAs depend on climate, mainly precipitation, and shape the phosphorus nutrition strategies of plants. We disentangled the impact of roots and associated microorganisms on mechanisms of phosphorus cycling mediated by LMWOAs by studying soils along an ecosystem-sequence (ecosequence) from arid shrubland (~70 mm yr−1), and Mediterranean woodland (~370 mm yr−1) to humid-temperate forest (~1470 mm yr−1). Phosphorus speciation in soil was examined by X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis (XANES). LMWOAs were quantified as biological rock-weathering and organic phosphorus mobilization agents and compared to kinetics of acid phosphatase as a proxy for organic phosphorus mineralization. Calcium-bound phosphorus in topsoils decreased from 126 mg kg−1 in the arid shrubland, to 19 mg kg−1 in the Mediterranean woodland and was undetectable in the humid-temperate forest. In contrast, organic phosphorus in topsoils in close root proximity (0–2 mm distance to roots) was absent in the arid shrubland but raised to 220 mg kg−1 in the Mediterranean woodland and to 291 mg kg- 1 in the humid-temperate forest. The organic phosphorus content in topsoils was 1.6 to 2.4 times higher in close root proximity (0–2 mm distance to roots) compared to bulk soil (4–6 mm distance to roots) in the Mediterranean woodland and humid-temperate forest, showing intensive phosphorus bioaccumulation in the rhizosphere. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that LMWOAs were explained by the content of hydroxyapatite and variscite phosphorus-species in the arid shrubland, indicating that LMWOAs contribute to mineral weathering in this soil. LMWOA contents, phosphatase activity, and microbial biomass carbon correlated strongly with organic phosphorus in the humid-temperate forest soil, which implies a high relevance of LMWOAs for organic phosphorus recycling. In the Mediterranean woodland soil, however, oxalic acid correlated with organic phosphorus in the topsoil (suggesting phosphorus recycling), whereas in the subsoil malic and citric acid were correlated with primary and secondary phosphorus minerals (implying mineral weathering). We conclude that phosphorus acquisition and cycling depend strongly on climate and that the functions of LMWOAs in the rhizosphere change fundamentally along the precipitation gradient. In the arid shrubland LMWOAs facilitate biochemical weathering (rock eating), while in the humid-temperate forest their functions change towards supporting organic phosphorus recycling (vegetarian)."", 'TITLE: Mechanisms Involved in Soil–Plant Interactions in Response to Poultry Manure and Phytase Enzyme Compared to Inorganic Phosphorus Fertilizers | KEYWORDS: phosphorus transporters; phosphorus uptake; poultry manure; soil phosphorus availability; sustainable fertilization | ABSTRACT: While soil responses to organic and inorganic phosphorus (P) fertilizers have been widely studied, plant physiological and molecular responses remain insufficiently characterized.

This study investigated the impact of poultry manure (PM) and its combination with phytase enzyme on molecular plant responses involved in P use efficiency (PUE) of ryegrass plants growing on a P-deficient Andisol. A greenhouse experiment under controlled conditions was performed to evaluate soil properties, plant biomass, P uptake, plant performance, and the expression of P transporters under the following P treatments: P deficiency (PD), mineral fertilizers (F), PM alone, and PM combined with phytase. The combination of PM and phytase enhanced soil P availability by 60% and increased soil P enzyme activities 2.6-fold, facilitating the mineralization of organic P. This resulted in a 63% increase in shoot P concentration and a 35% enhancement in shoot biomass.

Here, we used data on distribution of calanoid copepods in the upper layer of the ocean (0–500 m), a widely distributed taxonomic group in the pelagic realm, to assess the effects of changing oceanographic conditions on their diversity patterns and family and species richness. Copepods abundance and occurrence were evaluated from 2002 to 2015 covering the region extended between the coastal upwelling zone (CUP-Z) and the offshore region of Chile at subtropical and temperate areas. We used spatial analyses of community structure descriptors, such as abundance and diversity (family and species richness), multivariate analysis and General Additive Models (GAMS) in order to study the effect of surface temperature and its gradients, mixed layer depth, salinity and Chlorophyll-a on copepod diversity. Seventeen families were identified comprising 151 species distributed in 3 predefined zones in the onshore-offshore gradient covering the coastal upwelling, the coastal transition and the oligotrophic zones, whereas over the alongshore gradient, same families were majorly linked to the northern and southern portions of the sampled area (20–40°S). Families and species were significantly structured over the zonal gradient, revealing the dominant habitat for each of the families. Spatial patterns revealed the presence of transitional zones comprised by mixed taxa. Over the alongshore gradient this transition zone was linked to the subtropical convergence (30°S). The spatial variation of sea surface temperature (SST) revealed strong environmental zonation of temperature gradients across onshore-offshore and alongshore dimensions. Mean SST combined with mean mixed layer depth explained about 40% and about 29% of variation in family and species richness, respectively over the onshore-offshore axis. We thus conclude that the environmental zonation imposed by SST and its spatial gradients, considered as ecological barriers, is the key driver for maintaining diversity of copepods in the southeast Pacific.', 'TITLE: The influence of environmental stability and upwelling variation on copepod diversity in the Humboldt Current System off Chile | KEYWORDS: biodiversity; biogeography; copepods; environmental stability; Humboldt Current; upwelling | ABSTRACT: The Humboldt Current System (HCS) is a highly dynamic upwelling system implying a strongly variable environment for zooplankton inhabiting the coastal zone. This variability has major consequences for population dynamics, community composition, and ultimately diversity patterns of planktonic copepods which dominate the bulk of zooplankton biomass. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that environmental stability is the key modulating mechanism of copepod diversity patterns in the HCS. We used a 17-years (1995-2011) database on species occurrence of copepods along with environmental data for the upper 500 m of the ocean (divided into five vertical strata) for the upwelling zone off Chile, distinguishing two regions (northern and southern) having different seasonal regimes of wind-driven upwelling. We estimated indices for copepod diversity and their distribution, segregated by regions and depth strata. The indices were then associated with oceanographic variables forced by upwelling intensity, along with an estimate of eddy kinetic energy (EKE), as a proxy of environmental stability. From the entire community, we found 18 dominant species widely distributed in the study area.

In the text, several examples illustrate the performance of different strategies. The usual procedure to compute the number of wavelengths of each network link consists of choosing the same capacity to each link on the network. This decision is selected, in most cases, by simplicity and simulation limitations. Notwithstanding, there are no technical motives to force a uniform capacity on the network. In consequence, we analyze the impact on the network capacity of designating the minimum amount of wavelengths to each network link, while satisfying each user QoS requirement. Moreover, despite the chosen dimensioning strategy, it is usual to offer a much better QoS than requested for some users, with the corresponding waste of resources. We can amend this issue by limiting which wavelengths are available to each user according to its particular QoS constraint. This technique, known as Wavelength Grouping, seeks to provide to each user a QoS level closer to the one defined in the Service Level Agreement. By doing so, it is possible to reduce the network capacity needed to allow communication to its user, or diminishing the network blocking probability for a given wavelength capacity. In spite of the usual approach, in this work, we demonstrate that a non-uniform dimensioning strategy and a tighten QoS provision allows to save significant networks capacity, while simultaneously provisioning to each user the QoS established in its Service Level Agreement. This fact is very relevant nowadays, where an impending capacity crunch in optical networks is an important issue.', ""TITLE: A method for joint routing, wavelength dimensioning and fault tolerance for any set of simultaneous failures on dynamic WDM optical networks | KEYWORDS: Dynamic WDM optical networks; Fault tolerance; Routing; Wavelength conversion; Wavelength dimensioning | ABSTRACT: The design of optical networks decomposes into different tasks, where the engineers must basically organize the way the main system's resources are used, minimizing the design and operation costs and respecting critical performance constraints. More specifically, network operators face the challenge of solving routing and wavelength dimensioning problems while aiming to simultaneously minimize the network cost and to ensure that the network performance meets the level established in the Service Level Agreement (SLA). We call this the Routing and Wavelength Dimensioning (R&WD) problem. Another important problem to be solved is how to deal with failures of links when the network is operating. When at least one link fails, a high rate of data loss may occur. To avoid it, the network must be designed in such a manner that upon one or multiple failures, the affected connections can still communicate using alternative routes, a mechanism known as Fault Tolerance (FT). When the mechanism allows to deal with an arbitrary number of faults, we speak about Multiple Fault Tolerance (MFT). The different tasks before mentioned are usually solved separately, or in some cases by pairs, leading to solutions that are not necessarily close to optimal ones. This paper proposes a novel method to simultaneously solve all of them, that is, the Routing, the Wavelength Dimensioning, and the Multiple Fault Tolerance problems. The method allows to obtain: a) all the primary routes by which each connection normally transmits its information, b) the additional routes, called secondary routes, used to keep each user connected in cases where one or more simultaneous failures occur, and c) the number of wavelengths available at each link of the network, calculated such that the blocking probability of each connection is lower than a pre-determined threshold (which is a network design parameter), despite the occurrence of simultaneous link failures. The solution obtained by the new algorithm is significantly more efficient than current methods, its implementation is notably simple and its on-line operation is very fast. In the paper, different examples illustrate the results provided by the proposed technique."", 'TITLE: Blocking evaluation and wavelength dimensioning of dynamic WDM networks without wavelength conversion | KEYWORDS: Blocking probability; Dynamic WDMoptical networks; Heterogeneous traffic; No wavelengthconversion; Wavelength dimensioning | ABSTRACT: In this paper, a new fast and accurate methodology to evaluate the blocking probability (burst loss probability) in dynamic WDM networks without wavelength conversion is presented. The proposed model considers different traffic loads at each network connection (heterogeneous traffic). To take into account the wavelength continuity constraint, the method sees the network as a sequence of networks where all the links have capacity 1. Every network in the sequence is evaluated separately using a heuristic-based analytical technique. Then, a procedure combines the results of these evaluations in a way that captures the dependencies that occur in real systems due to the competition for bandwidth between the different connections. The method efficiently achieves results very close to those obtained by simulation, but orders of magnitude faster, allowing the evaluation of the blocking probability of all users (connections) for mesh network topologies. We illustrate the use of this procedure in the dimensioning of a WDM network, that is, in calculating the number of wavelengths on every network link, by considering the traffic load of every user, the routing algorithm and the maximum connection blocking probability acceptable by every user (quality of service) are determined.']"

This precursor is obtained from cheap fly ash by an easy calcination process at 850 °C and a green extraction with water. The obtained mesoporous fly ash material had a surface area of 282 m2 g−1 and a pore size of 5.7 nm. It was functionalized with ethylene diamino moieties via the well-known SAMMS method, followed by a DRIFT analysis that clearly showed the successful functionalization. An excellent adsorbent was obtained for the adsorption of sulfate anions by the solid's modification with copper forming a copper-ethylenediamine complex. The adsorption of sulfates was studied in a batch system where the pH at highest adsorption 8 was and the adsorption time remarkably fast (5 min). The kinetic data were fitted according to a pseudo-second order model with a high coefficient of linear regression at different initial concentrations. The adsorption isotherm that best fitted the experimental data was the Freundlich model. The maximum sulfate adsorption capacity of this very cheap fly ash based adsorbent was 146.1 mg g−1, 3 times greater than the values reported in literature and commercial adsorbent materials.""]"

The δ-slow regime | KEYWORDS: hydrodynamics; methods: analytical; stars: early-type; stars: mass-loss; stars: winds, outflows | ABSTRACT: Accurate mass-loss rates and terminal velocities from massive stars winds are essential to obtain synthetic spectra from radiative transfer calculations and to determine the evolutionary path of massive stars. From a theoretical point of view, analytical expressions for the wind parameters and velocity profile would have many advantages over numerical calculations that solve the complex non-linear set of hydrodynamic equations. In a previous work, we obtained an analytical description for the fast wind regime. Now, we propose an approximate expression for the line-force in terms of new parameters and obtain a velocity profile closed-form solution (in terms of the Lambert W function) for the δ-slow regime. Using this analytical velocity profile, we were able to obtain the mass-loss rates based on the m-CAK theory. Moreover, we established a relation between this new set of line-force parameters with the known stellar and m-CAK line-force parameters. To this purpose, we calculated a grid of numerical hydrodynamical models and performed a multivariate multiple regression. The numerical and our descriptions lead to good agreement between their values.', 'TITLE: Evolution of rotating massive stars with new hydrodynamic wind models | KEYWORDS: Outflows; Stars: evolution; Stars: mass-loss; Stars: massive; Stars: rotation; Stars: winds | ABSTRACT: Context. Mass loss due to radiatively line-driven winds is central to our understanding of the evolution of massive stars in both single and multiple systems. This mass loss plays a key role in modulating the stellar evolution at different metallicities, particularly in the case of massive stars with M* = 25 Mo. Aims. We extend the evolution models introduced in Paper I, where the mass-loss recipe is based on the simultaneous calculation of the wind hydrodynamics and the line acceleration, by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation. Methods. As in Paper I, we introduce a grid of self-consistent line-force parameters (k,- a,- d) for a set of standard evolutionary tracks using GENEC. Based on this grid, we analysed the effects of stellar rotation, CNO abundances, and He/H ratio on the wind solutions to derive additional terms for the recipe with which we predict the self-consistent mass-loss rate, Msc. With this, we generated a new set of evolutionary tracks with rotation for MZAMS = 25, 40, 70, and 120 Mo, and for metallicities Z = 0.014 (Galactic) and 0.006 (Large Magellanic Cloud). Results. In addition to the expected correction factor due to rotation, the mass-loss rate decreases when the surface becomes more helium rich, especially in the later moments of the main-sequence phase. The self-consistent approach gives lower mass-loss rates than the standard values adopted in previous GENEC evolution models. This decrease strongly affects the tracks of the most massive models. Weaker winds allow the star to retain more mass, but also more angular momentum. As a consequence, weaker wind models rotate faster and show a less efficient mixing in their inner stellar structure at a given age. Conclusions. The self-consistent tracks predict an evolution of the rotational velocities through the main sequence that closely agrees with the range of v sin i values found by recent surveys of Galactic O-type stars. As subsequent implications, the weaker winds from self-consistent models also suggest a reduction of the contribution of the isotope 26Al to the interstellar medium due to stellar winds of massive stars during the MS phase. Moreover, the higher luminosities found for the self-consistent evolutionary models suggest that some populations of massive stars might be less massive than previously thought, as in the case of Ofpe stars at the Galactic centre. Therefore, this study opens a wide range of consequences for further research based on the evolution of massive stars.', 'TITLE: ISOSCELES: Grid of stellar atmosphere and hydrodynamic models of massive stars. The first results | KEYWORDS: hydrodynamics; outflows; stars: early-type; stars: mass loss; stars: winds; techniques: spectroscopic | ABSTRACT: In this work we seek to derive simultaneously the stellar and wind parameters of massive stars, mainly A and B type supergiant stars. Our stellar properties encompass the effective temperature, the surface gravity, the micro-turbulence velocity and, silicon abundance. For wind properties we consider the line–force parameters (α, k and δ) obtained from the standard line-driven wind theory. To model the data we use the radiative transport code Fastwind considering the hydrodynamic solutions derived with the stationary code Hydwind. Then, ISOSCELES, a grid of stellar atmosphere and hydrodynamic models of massive stars is created. Together with the observed spectra and a semi-automatic tool the physical properties from these stars are determined through spectral line fittings. This quantitative spectroscopic analysis provide an estimation about the line–force parameters. In addition, we confirm that the hydrodynamic solutions, called δ-slow solutions, describe quite reliable the radiation line-driven winds of B supergiant stars.']"

We evaluated the possibility to synthesize a new L-ASNase from Escherichia coli with human-like glycosylation and study the glycosylation effect on the biochemical properties of the enzyme. Six L-ASNase mutants were also created in which L-ASNase glycosylation sites were removed through site-directed mutagenesis. The WT L-ASNase was successfully expressed, secreted and glycosylated by an engineered P. pastoris strain and presented predominantly Man5GlcNAc2 glycans on its structure, which were then able to decrease L-ASNase immunogenicity in vitro. The purified glycosylated L-ASNase has shown a 30-fold decrease in specific enzymatic activity compared to the non-glycosylated proteoform, but a triple mutant L-ASNase (3M) was able to restore L-ASNase biological activity to significant levels. 3M accumulated in the yeast periplasmic space and there presented a 28-fold increase in enzymatic activity when compared to the fully glycosylated proteoform. Both WT and 3M L-ASNases presented increased stability in human serum compared to non-glycosylated L-ASNase. This study demonstrates the important effects of glycosylation on L-ASNase properties and opens up new possibilities to use glycosylated L-ASNases for the treatment of ALL.', 'TITLE: Heterophilic antibodies in sera from individuals without loxoscelism cross-react with phospholipase D from the venom of Loxosceles and Sicarius spiders | KEYWORDS: Heterophilic antibodies; Loxosceles laeta; Natural antibodies; Sicarius | ABSTRACT: Background: Loxoscelism is a severe human envenomation caused by Loxosceles spider venom.

HTC was conducted for one hour at 220◦C in a 5 L reactor, followed by gasification in a hybrid porous medium gasifier. The study investigated the effects of different filtration speeds on combustion temperature and hydrogen concentrations. The results showed that a filtration speed of 35 cm/s resulted in a maximum combustion temperature of 1035.7◦C. The temperature remained consistent across filter speeds, while higher velocities yielded higher hydrogen concentrations.

The rearing of E. megalocyathus paralarvae from hatching to the settlement of juveniles lasts 90 days and it represents the bottleneck in the culture of this species. The paralarval stages from 1 to 60 days after hatching (DAH) are fed on enriched Artemia while, when pre-settlement behavior appears, from 60 DAH onwards, the feeding protocol is a mixed diet of enriched Artemia and juvenile marine crabs. Marine crustaceans represent a suitable diet to improve E. megalocyathus paralarvae survival, complementing the enriched Artemia to feed the pre-settling paralarvae. To determine the effect of Artemia enrichment on the response of E. megalocyathus at the pre-settling paralarval stage, paralarvae were fed two mixed diets containing juvenile marine crabs (Petrolisthes spp.) and differing only in Artemia enrichment: enriched (complete diet, CD), or unenriched (limited diet, LD). After 30 days of feeding trial, samples consisting of whole paralarvae were collected for transcriptomic analysis using high-quality total RNA to generate six mRNA libraries (two treatments x three biological replicates). A total of 270 genes were differentially expressed between paralarvae fed LD and those fed CD. When classifying the cellular processes in which the genes of LD and CD paralarvae differed significantly, it was observed that the downregulated/upregulated gene ratio was 2/1 in genes related to membrane organization and neuron differentiation. The genes of paralarvae fed a LD for which upregulation was equal to or >20 times compared with those fed a CD were related with increased rearrangement of tissues, molecular transport, energy production, improvement of sensory organs, cellular processes, transcription, and protein catabolic processes. The downregulated genes in paralarvae fed a LD were involved with reduced DNA repair and mRNA replication and elongation, molecular transport, cellular protein modification, cellular component organization, inflammatory cytokines, and biosynthetic processes. It was concluded that removing enrichment from Artemia, even under co-feeding with marine crustaceans, results in notable changes in the transcription that, while not generating a significant detriment to growth in 30 days of experimentation, could affect subsequent growth phases.', 'TITLE: Evaluation of physiological stress and nutritional deficiency related to cannibalism in early paralarvae of Patagonian red octopus Enteroctopus megalocyathus | KEYWORDS: Cannibalism; Enteroctopus megalocyathus; High density; HSP70; Nutritional deficiency; Octopus farming; Paralarvae rearing; Physiological stress | ABSTRACT: Patagonian red octopus Enteroctopus megalocyathus is one of the two octopuses’ species of great commercial importance in Chile. At the present time, the life cycle of this species in captivity has been closed at experimental level; however, high mortalities at the early paralarvae stage are a limiting factor for attaining sustainable production. Cannibalism has been identified as one of the main mortality causes at the early paralarvae rearing. Stress has been proposed as an important cause of cannibalism in cephalopods. Likewise, nutritional deficiency has been suggested as a potential cause to onset cannibalism. However, neither of both factors has been directly assessed in cephalopod paralarvae. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate if physiological stress due to a food shortage and/or to a high rearing density of paralarvae trigger cannibalism in E. megalocyathus. An experiment was carried out with newly hatched paralarvae, under conditions that trigger cannibalism with densities of 10 and 15 paralarvae L −1 combined with two measures of prey availability: 0 and 2 prey paralarva −1 day −1 . Paralarvae alone in the aquarium fed ad libitum was used as a control to avoid cannibalism. Nutritional status was assessed as the total protein and energy content per paralarvae; and the 70 kD heat shock protein (HSP70) transcript level was used as a bioindicator of physiological stress, documented as a suitable stress biomarker for cephalopods. No differences were observed between the treatments and control in the absolute protein levels and energy content. There was a strong induction in HSP70 transcriptional level when high density and prey availability where combined, proving that there are only a few paralarvae rearing combinations that cause critical stress and trigger HSP70 transcription. In experimental conditions, nutritional status indicators showed that early paralarvae, with similar reserves of protein and energy, exhibited cannibalism. Results suggest that mortality as well as cannibalism is associated with competition for prey and with nutritional and energy imbalance due to food shortage that determines the expression of the related stress gene.', 'TITLE: Characterization of cannibalism in early paralarvae of Patagonian red octopus, Enteroctopus megalocyathus (Gould, 1852), grown in a controlled environment | KEYWORDS: cannibalism; early paralarvae; Enteroctopus megalocyathus; paralarvae density; prey availability | ABSTRACT: In the experimental mariculture of Patagonian red octopus, Enteroctopus megalocyathus, paralarvae rearing showed the highest mortalities. Part of this mortality has been attributed to cannibalism, so we studied the joint effect of paralarvae density and prey availability upon cannibalism in the first 2 weeks after hatching. Three culture densities (1, 5, and 10 paralarvae/L) and three prey availabilities (0, 5, and 10 prey day−1 paralarvae−1) were tested. Two experiments were carried out in early paralarvae: one experiment where the prey consisted of artemia 5 mm in size (Experiment 1) and other experiment where the artemia size was 1 mm (Experiment 2). Results showed, in both experiments, that survival and cannibalism during the first 2 weeks after hatching were independent of the paralarvae density and the prey availability. In experiment 1, with artemia 5 mm in size, the mortality attributed to cannibalism decreased when the prey availability was increased, nor was there any effect of the paralarvae density on cannibalism. In experiment 2, with artemia 1 mm in size, the mortality attributed to cannibalism was independent of both factors. So, the cannibalism in early paralarvae could be reduced by increasing the availability of prey if the prey is of an appropriate size.']"

However, the additional dc-dc converter increases the power converter losses. The concept of partial power converters (PPCs), which reduce the amount of power handled by the dc stage, can mitigate this effect. However, the type of topology, its power and voltage rating, efficiency, and an operating range can vary significantly depending on the function (boosting or reducing voltage) and type of PV application and scale (micro-, string-, or multi-sting inverter). This paper analyzes the possible configuration of connections of PPC depending on the application and scale of the PV system and introduces a new buck-type PPC. Three solutions for practical PV systems are further elaborated, including experimental validation. Results show that the PPC concept greatly improves the overall PV system efficiency with the added benefit that the dc-dc stage power ratings achieved are only a fraction of the PV system, reducing size and cost of the power converter without affecting the system performance.']"

Nonetheless, our knowledge on antibiotic-producing Streptomyces from Antarctic is very limited. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of organic extracts from Antarctic Streptomyces strains was evaluated by disk diffusion assays and minimum inhibitory concentration. The strain Streptomyces sp. So13.3 showed the greatest antibiotic activity (MIC = 15.6 μg/mL) against Gram-positive bacteria and growth reduction of Gram‒negative pathogens. The bioactive fraction in the crude extract was revealed by TLC‒bioautography at R f = 0.78 with molecular weight between 148 and 624 m/z detected by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The strain So13.3 was taxonomically affiliated as Streptomyces fildesensis. Whole genome sequencing and analysis suggested a 9.47 Mb genome size with 42 predicted biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and 56 putative clusters representing a 22% of total genome content. Interestingly, a large number of them (11 of 42 BGCs and 40 of 56 putative BGCs), did not show similarities with other known BGCs.

Streptomyces appears as one of the main sources of these enzymes, but complete genome sequences of keratinolytic bacteria are still limited. This article reports the complete genomes of three marine-derived streptomycetes that show different levels of feather keratin degradation, with high (strain G11C), low (strain CHD11), and no (strain Vc74B-19) keratinolytic activity. A multi-step bioinformatics approach is described to explore genes encoding putative keratinases in these genomes. Despite their differential keratinolytic activity, multiplatform annotation reveals similar quantities of ORFs encoding putative proteases in strains G11C, CHD11, and Vc74B-19. Comparative genomics classified these putative proteases into 140 orthologous groups and 17 unassigned orthogroup peptidases belonging to strain G11C. Similar network analysis reveals three network communities of putative peptidases related to known keratinases of the peptidase families S01, S08, and M04. When combined with the prediction of cellular localization and phylogenetic reconstruction, seven putative keratinases from the highly keratinolytic strain Streptomyces sp. G11C are identified. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-step bioinformatics analysis that complements comparative genomics with phylogeny and cellular localization prediction, for the prediction of genes encoding putative keratinases in streptomycetes.', 'TITLE: Enzyme Bioprospection of Marine-Derived Actinobacteria from the Chilean Coast and New Insight in the Mechanism of Keratin Degradation in Streptomyces sp. G11C | KEYWORDS: hydrolytic enzymes; keratinolytic proteases; marine actinobacteria; rare actinobacteria; secretome; Streptomyces | ABSTRACT: Marine actinobacteria are viewed as a promising source of enzymes with potential technological applications. They contribute to the turnover of complex biopolymers, such as pectin, lignocellulose, chitin, and keratin, being able to secrete a wide variety of extracellular enzymes. Among these, keratinases are a valuable alternative for recycling keratin-rich waste, which is generated in large quantities by the poultry industry. In this work, we explored the biocatalytic potential of 75 marine-derived actinobacterial strains, focusing mainly on the search for keratinases. A major part of the strains secreted industrially important enzymes, such as proteases, lipases, cellulases, amylases, and keratinases. Among these, we identified two streptomycete strains that presented great potential for recycling keratin wastes—Streptomyces sp. CHA1 and Streptomyces sp. G11C. Substrate concentration, incubation temperature, and, to a lesser extent, inoculum size were found to be important parameters that influenced the production of keratinolytic enzymes in both strains. In addition, proteomic analysis of culture broths from Streptomyces sp. G11C on turkey feathers showed a high abundance and diversity of peptidases, belonging mainly to the serine and metallo-superfamilies. Two proteases from families S08 and M06 were highly expressed. These results contributed to elucidate the mechanism of keratin degradation mediated by streptomycetes.']"

The government of Guatemala has introduced a plan to increase renewable generation capacity, while an estimated 76% of Guatemalans are energy poor. In this paper, we evaluate the trade-offs between alleviating energy poverty and achieving renewable energy goals in Guatemala. We present a framework that combines an electricity cost model with a household expenditure survey to assess the effects that a national renewable energy development goal could have on energy poverty through added electricity expenditures. We find that the development of new renewable electricity generation has potential to significantly increase tariffs for residential electricity consumers across the country, whereby 80% of municipalities could experience more than one-third increase in monthly energy expenditures. More importantly, we find that the distribution of impacts will not be equal everywhere: households in the western, rural part of Guatemala that are already energy stressed will likely experience the greatest cost burdens because natural resource availability is low while overall poverty is already high. In addition, we compare the costs of renewable versus fossil fuel development and find that the least-cost policy in Guatemala includes a mix of both renewable and fossil technologies.', 'TITLE: The impact of a carbon tax on the chilean electricity generation sector | KEYWORDS: Carbon tax; Climate change; Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE); Energy policy; Generation expansion planning; Macroeconomic models; Non-conventional renewable energy | ABSTRACT: This paper aims to analyse the economy-wide implications of a carbon tax applied on the Chilean electricity generation sector. In order to analyse the macroeconomic impacts, both an energy sectorial model and a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model have been used. During the year 2014 a carbon tax of 5 US$/tCO2e was approved in Chile. This tax and its increases (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 US$/tCO2e) are evaluated in this article. The results show that the effectiveness of this policy depends on some variables which are not controlled by policy makers, for example, non-conventional renewable energy investment cost projections, natural gas prices, and the feasibility of exploiting hydroelectric resources. For a carbon tax of 20 US$/tCO2e, the average annual emission reduction would be between 1.1 and 9.1 million tCO2e. However, the price of the electricity would increase between 8.3 and 9.6 US$/MWh.

However, these conflicts have traditionally been ignored by the literature, especially those labelled as minor conflicts, which are not recorded by official statistics. Through three focus groups, we sought to explore the perception that drivers have about the cyclists of Santiago (Chile). The results suggest that drivers consider that cyclists do not perceive their own vulnerability and consider that many cyclists do not respect or know the Traffic Law. In their interactions, bus drivers often generate and abide to stereotypes of cyclists. Bus drivers perceive that the quality of road infrastructure is making their job harder, which potentially creates more conflicts with cyclists. Finally, the main strategy employed by bus drivers to deal with these conflicts is to maintain as much distance as possible from cyclists.', 'TITLE: Bus drivers and their interactions with cyclists: An analysis of minor conflicts | KEYWORDS: Bus drivers; Cyclists; Latin America; Perception; Road behaviour | ABSTRACT: Driving a bus in a city is a challenging task as it demands paying attention to changing conditions (e.g., weather, congestion) while interacting with passengers and other road users who sometimes display unpredictable behaviours.

The survey asked drivers about their perception of other transport modes, their experience with traffic collisions and the conflicts they have had with cyclists. Later, logistic regression models were estimated, using “coexistence with cyclists” as the dependent variable. The findings show that younger and older drivers have a better perception of cyclists compared to middle-aged ones. Negative experiences with cyclists worsen the perception of co-existence with cyclists; meanwhile, previous cycling experience was unrelated to drivers’ perceptions.

At the end of experimental time samples of plasma, liver, gill, intestine, kidney, skeletal muscle, stomach and pyloric caeca were obtained. Growth, weight gain, hepatosomatic index and specific growth rate increased at 15 and 31 psu and were lower at 5 psu salinity. Gill Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) activity presented a “U-shaped” relationship respect to salinity, with its minimum rates at 15 psu, while this activity correlated negatively with salinity at both anterior and posterior intestinal portions. No significant changes in NKA activity were observed in kidney or mid intestine. Large changes in plasma, metabolite levels and enzymatic activities related to energy metabolism in liver, gill, intestine, kidney and muscle were generally found in the groups exposed to 5 and 31 psu compared to the 15 psu group. Only the pepsin activity (digestive enzymes) assessed enhanced with environmental salinity, while pyloric caeca trypsin/chymotrypsin ratio decreased. This study suggests that juvenile of E. maclovinus presents greater growth near its iso-osmotic point (15 psu) and hyperosmotic environment (31 psu). Acclimation to low salinity increased the osmoregulatory expenditure as seen by the gill and anterior intestine results, while at high salinity, branchial osmoregulatory activity was also enhanced. This requires the mobilization of lipid stores and amino acids, thereby holding the growth of fish back. The subsequent reallocation of energy sources was not sufficient to maintain the growth rate of fish exposed to 5 psu. Thus, E. maclovinus juveniles present better growth efficiencies in salinities above the iso-osmotic point and hyperosmotic environment of this species, showing their best performance at 15 psu as seen by the main osmoregulatory and energy metabolism enzymatic activities.', 'TITLE: Metabolic responses to salinity changes in the subantarctic notothenioid teleost Eleginops maclovinus | KEYWORDS: Carbohydrates; Eleginops maclovinus; Gills; Kidney; Lipids; Liver; Metabolism | ABSTRACT: Eleginops maclovinus is an endemic, subantarctic Notothenioidei species.

Metabolite contents and enzymatic activities related to carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolisms were evaluated in metabolic (liver) and osmoregulatory (gill and kidney) tissues. At extreme salinities (5 and 45 psu), the liver showed a high consumption of energy reserves, mainly as amino acids and carbohydrates. Carbohydrate metabolism in the gills did not change under different salinities, but increased lactate levels were found, suggesting that this tissue may use lactate as an energy substrate. Amino acid metabolism in the gills decreased at 5 psu but increased at 45 psu, and lipid metabolism increased at 5 and 15 psu during the first days of the trial, indicating a possible use of lipids as energy. Kidney carbohydrate catabolism and amino acid metabolism increased after 14 days at 45 psu, while lipid metabolism did not vary in relation to salinity changes.

The focus is to explore the information provided by each reactivity model and how they complement or reinforce each other. Our results showed that the Bell-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationship is fulfilled, which is consistent with the Hammond-Leffler postulate. The electronic chemical potential based analysis classifies the reactions as HOMO-, HOMO/LUMO-, and LUMO-controlled reactions as the activation energy increases. It seems likely that HOMO-controlled reaction shifts into LUMO-controlled one as the transition state (TS) position does from early into late. Therefore, the transition from HOMO-(and early TS) into LUMO-controlled (and late TS) is paid by shifting the overall energy change into an endothermic direction, thus supporting the fulfillment of the BEP principle. While thermodynamic models unveil that the distortion or structural rearrangements mainly drive the activation barriers rather than interaction or electronic rearrangements in accord with the distortion/interaction and reaction force analysis, respectively. It is also found that both models are consistent when energy associated with structural and electronic reordering from reaction force analysis is respectively confronted with destabilizing (distortion and Pauli repulsion) and stabilizing (electrostatic and orbital interactions) contributions from the distortion/interaction model, which, on the other hand, increases as low activation barrier and high exothermicity are converted into the high barrier and low exothermicity along with the BEP relation. Finally, the reaction force constant reveals that all 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions proceed by a synchronous single-step mechanism, unveiling that the degree of synchronicity is quite the same in all reactions, confirming the statement that BEP is fulfilled for similar reactions proceeding by a quite alike degree of synchronicity.', 'TITLE: Reaction force constant as a descriptor of the principle of non-perfect synchronization | KEYWORDS: 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions; Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle; Principle of non perfect synchronization; Reaction force constant | ABSTRACT: Context: In this study, a small set of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions that proceed at the same exothermicity is presented.

The main findings can be summarized as: (i) for symmetric quantum-well wires (QWW) the binding energy is an even function of the growth-direction impurity position and this even symmetry breaks in the case of asymmetric structures; (ii) the coupling between the two parallel wires increases with the hydrostatic pressure due to the negative slope of the confinement potential as a function of pressure; (iii) for impurities in the central barrier the binding energy is an increasing function of the hydrostatic pressure; (iv) depending on the direction of the applied electric field and the fixed impurity position, the binding energy can behave as an increasing or decreasing step function of the applied electric field, and finally (v) for appropriate values of the wires and barrier widths the results reproduce the exact limits of 2D and 3D hydrogenic atom as well as the limits of finite and infinite potential barrier quantum wells. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize and compare six agri-food wastes/byproducts (lupin hull, canola press-cake, lupin byproduct, camelina press-cake, linseed hull, and linseed press-cake) as potential sources of food-grade Pickering stabilizers. The results showed that all samples contained surface-active agents such as proteins (46.71–17.90 g/100 g) and dietary fiber (67.10–38.58 g/100 g). Canola press-cake, camelina press-cake, and linseed hull exhibited the highest concentrations of polyphenols: 2891, 2549, and 1672 mg GAE/100 g sample, respectively. Moreover, the agri-food byproduct particles presented a partial wettability with a water contact angle (WCA) between 77.5 and 42.2 degrees, and they were effective for stabilizing oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. The emulsions stabilized by Camelina press-cake, lupin hull, and lupin by-product (≥3.5%, w/w) were highly stable against creaming during 45 days of storage. Furthermore, polarized and confocal microscopy revealed that the particles were anchored to the interfaces of oil droplets, which is a demonstration of the formation of a Pickering emulsion stabilized by solid particles. These results suggest that agri-food wastes/byproducts are good emulsifiers that can be applied to produce stable Pickering emulsions.', 'TITLE: Food-Grade Oil-in-Water (O/W) Pickering Emulsions Stabilized by Agri-Food Byproduct Particles | KEYWORDS: agri-food byproducts; emulsifying capacity; Pickering emulsions; Pickering particles | ABSTRACT: In recent years, emulsions stabilized by solid particles (known as Pickering emulsions) have gained considerable attention due to their excellent stability and for being environmentally friendly compared to the emulsions stabilized by synthetic surfactants. In this context, edible Pickering stabilizers from agri-food byproducts have attracted much interest because of their noteworthy benefits, such as easy preparation, excellent biocompatibility, and unique interfacial properties. Consequently, different food-grade particles have been reported in recent publications with distinct raw materials and preparation methods. Moreover, emulsions stabilized by solid particles can be applied in a wide range of industrial fields, such as food, biomedicine, cosmetics, and fine chemical synthesis. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Pickering emulsions stabilized by a diverse range of edible solid particles, specifically agri-food byproducts, including legumes, oil seeds, and fruit byproducts. Moreover, this review summarizes some aspects related to the factors that influence the stabilization and physicochemical properties of Pickering emulsions. In addition, the current research trends in applications of edible Pickering emulsions are documented. Consequently, this review will detail the latest progress and new trends in the field of edible Pickering emulsions for readers.', 'TITLE: Enhancing the Retention and Oxidative Stability of Volatile Flavors: A Novel Approach Utilizing O/W Pickering Emulsions Based on Agri-Food Byproducts and Spray-Drying | KEYWORDS: agri-food byproducts; D-limonene; flavor retention; Pickering emulsions; spray-drying | ABSTRACT: Spray-drying is a commonly used method for producing powdered flavors, but the high temperatures involved often result in the loss of volatile molecules. To address this issue, our study focused on a novel approach: developing O/W Pickering emulsions with agri-food byproducts to encapsulate and protect D-limonene during spray-drying and storage. Emulsions formulated with lupin hull, lupin-byproduct (a water-insoluble protein–fiber byproduct derived from the production of lupin protein isolate), and camelina press-cake were subjected to spray-drying at 160 °C. The results revealed that these emulsions exhibited good stability against creaming. The characteristics of the dry emulsions (powders) were influenced by the concentration of byproducts. Quantitative analysis revealed that Pickering emulsions enhanced the retention of D-limonene during spray-drying, with the highest retention achieved using 3% lupin hull and 1% camelina press-cake. Notably, lupin-stabilized emulsions yielded powders with enhanced oxidative stability compared to those stabilized with camelina press-cake. Our findings highlight the potential of food-grade Pickering emulsions to improve the stability of volatile flavors during both processing and storage.']"

Early recognition of MIS-C is key to prognosis; therefore, establishing clinical and laboratory biomarkers that predict complications is urgently needed. Objective: We characterized the immune response and clinical features of patients with acute MIS-C and determined biomarkers of disease in a cohort of 42 Latin American patients. Methods: Immune characterization was performed using flow cytometry from peripheral mononuclear cells and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–specific humoral and cellular response was performed using flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunospot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and neutralizing antibody assays. Results: MIS-C is characterized by robust T-cell activation and cytokine storm. We uncovered that while C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 9, IL-10, CXCL8, CXCL10, IL-6, and IL-18 are significantly elevated in patients with shock, while CCL5 was increased in milder disease. Monocyte dysregulation was specifically associated with KD-like MIS-C. Interestingly, MIS-C patients show a natural killer cell degranulation defect that is persistent after 6 months of disease presentation, suggesting it could underlie disease susceptibility. Most MIS-C had gastrointestinal involvement, and higher levels of neopterin were identified in their stools, potentially representing a biomarker of intestinal inflammation in MIS-C. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–specific cellular response and neutralizing antibodies were identifiable in convalescent MIS-C patients, suggesting sustained immunity. Conclusion: Clinical characterization and comprehensive immunophenotyping of Chilean MIS-C cohort provide valuable insights in understanding immune dysregulation in MIS-C and identify relevant biomarkers of disease that could be used to predict severity and organ involvement.', 'TITLE: Transient gestational hypothyroxinemia accelerates and enhances ulcerative colitis-like disorder in the male offspring | KEYWORDS: autoimmunity; colon inflammation; gestational hypothyroxinemia; immune cells; radical oxygen species; ulcerative colitis | ABSTRACT: Introduction: Gestational hypothyroxinemia (HTX) is a condition that occurs frequently at the beginning of pregnancy, and it correlates with cognitive impairment, autism, and attentional deficit in the offspring. Evidence in animal models suggests that gestational HTX can increase the susceptibility of the offspring to develop strong inflammation in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a frequent inflammatory bowel disease with unknown causes. Therefore, the intensity of ulcerative colitis-like disorder (UCLD) and the cellular and molecular factors involved in proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses were analyzed in the offspring gestated in HTX (HTX-offspring) and compared with the offspring gestated in euthyroidism (Control-offspring). Methods: Gestational HTX was induced by the administration of 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole in drinking water to pregnant mice during E10–E14. The HTX-offspring were induced with UCLD by the acute administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). The score of UCLD symptomatology was registered every day, and colon histopathology, immune cells, and molecular factors involved in the inflammatory or anti-inflammatory response were analyzed on day 6 of DSS treatment. Results: The HTX-offspring displayed earlier UCLD pathological symptoms compared with the Control-offspring. After 6 days of DSS treatment, the HTX-offspring almost doubled the score of the Control-offspring. The histopathological analyses of the colon samples showed signs of inflammation at the distal and medial colon for both the HTX-offspring and Control-offspring. However, significantly more inflammatory features were detected in the proximal colon of the HTX-offspring induced with UCLD compared with the Control-offspring induced with UCLD. Significantly reduced mRNA contents encoding for protective molecules like glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and mucin-2 (MUC-2) were found in the colon of the HTX-offspring as compared with the Control-offspring. Higher percentages of Th17 lymphocytes were detected in the colon tissues of the HTX-offspring induced or not with UCLD as compared with the Control-offspring. Discussion: Gestational HTX accelerates the onset and increases the intensity of UCLD in the offspring. The low expression of MUC-2 and GCLC together with high levels of Th17 Lymphocytes in the colon tissue suggests that the HTX-offspring has molecular and cellular features that favor inflammation and tissue damage. These results are important evidence to be aware of the impact of gestational HTX as a risk factor for UCLD development in offspring.', 'TITLE: Coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with inborn errors of immunity: An international study | KEYWORDS: COVID-19; hypogammaglobulinemia; immune dysregulation; inborn errors of immunity; primary immunodeficiencies; SARS-CoV-2 | ABSTRACT: Background: There is uncertainty about the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in individuals with rare inborn errors of immunity (IEI), a population at risk of developing severe coronavirus disease 2019. This is relevant not only for these patients but also for the general population, because studies of IEIs can unveil key requirements for host defense. Objective: We sought to describe the presentation, manifestations, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IEI to inform physicians and enhance understanding of host defense against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: An invitation to participate in a retrospective study was distributed globally to scientific, medical, and patient societies involved in the care and advocacy for patients with IEI. Results: We gathered information on 94 patients with IEI with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their median age was 25 to 34 years. Fifty-three patients (56%) suffered from primary antibody deficiency, 9 (9.6%) had immune dysregulation syndrome, 6 (6.4%) a phagocyte defect, 7 (7.4%) an autoinflammatory disorder, 14 (15%) a combined immunodeficiency, 3 (3%) an innate immune defect, and 2 (2%) bone marrow failure. Ten were asymptomatic, 25 were treated as outpatients, 28 required admission without intensive care or ventilation, 13 required noninvasive ventilation or oxygen administration, 18 were admitted to intensive care units, 12 required invasive ventilation, and 3 required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine patients (7 adults and 2 children) died. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that (1) more than 30% of patients with IEI had mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and (2) risk factors predisposing to severe disease/mortality in the general population also seemed to affect patients with IEI, including more younger patients. Further studies will identify pathways that are associated with increased risk of severe disease and are nonredundant or redundant for protection against SARS-CoV-2.']"

Previous studies have shown that adrenergic activity through norepinephrine (NE) participates in the control of follicular development and steroidal secretion from the ovary, among other functions. To examine this phenomenon, the denervation of the gonad has been widely used to observe changes in the ovary's performance. Nevertheless, the effect of the absence of adrenergic nerves in the ovary has only been studied in short times periods. In the present work, we used guanethidine (a drug that produces an irreversible sympathectomy) during the infantile period of rats, and we observed its effects in the adult rat (6 months old). Our results indicate that ovarian NE content is recovered at 6 months old, alongside with an increase of the adrenal content of NE and a dysfunctional celiac ganglion. Together, these results suggest that the recovery of ovarian NE does not come from a neural origin. In addition, ovarian performance was impaired because the changes in follicular development and steroidal secretion are not recovered despite the recovery of ovarian NE content. In conclusion, these results suggest that the nerve-ovarian connections, which are established during infantile development, are necessary for the accurate response of the ovary to sympathetic stimulation."", 'TITLE: Increases in norepinephrine release and ovarian cyst formation during ageing in the rat | KEYWORDS:  | ABSTRACT: Background: Depletion of ovarian follicles is associated with the end of reproductive function in ageing females. Recently, it has been described that this process parallels increases in the concentration of norepinephrine (NE) in the rat ovary. In sexually mature rats, experimentally-induced increases in the sympathetic tone of the ovary is causally related to ovarian cyst formation and deranged follicular development. Thus, there is a possibility that increased ovarian NE concentrations represent changes in the activity of sympathetic nerves, which consequently participate in the process of ovarian cyst formation observed during ageing in the human and experimental animal models. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats between 6 and 14 months old were used to analyse the capacity of the ovary to release 3H-NE recently incorporated under transmural depolarisation in relation to changes in the ovarian follicular population. Morphometric analysis of ovarian follicles and real time PCR for Bcl2 and Bax mRNA were used to assess follicular atresia. Results: From 8 months old, the induced release of recently incorporated 3H-norepinephrine (3H-NE) from the ovary and ovarian NE concentrations increased, reaching their peak values at 12 months old and remained elevated up to 14 months old. Increases in sympathetic nerve activity paralleled changes in the follicular population, as well as disappearance of the corpus luteum. In contrast, luteinised follicles, precystic follicles, and cystic follicles increased. During this period, the relationship between Bax and Bcl2 mRNAs (the proapoptotic/ antiapoptotic signals) increased, suggesting atresia as the principal mechanism contributing to the decreased follicular population. When NE tone was increased, the mRNA ratio favoured Bcl2 to Bax and antiapoptotic signals dominated this period of development. Thus, these changing ratios could be responsible for the increase in luteinised follicles, as well as precystic and cystic follicles. Conclusion: These data suggest that the ageing process in the ovary of the Sprague-Dawley rat is accompanied by an increased sympathetic tone of the ovary. Consequently, this sympathetic change could be related to a neuroendocrine-driven formation of a polycystic condition similar to that observed in the sympathetic-activated adult ovary. © 2009 Acuña et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.', 'TITLE: Muscarinic receptors in the rat ovary are involved in follicular development but not in steroid secretion | KEYWORDS: acetylcholine; atresia; follicular development; Huperzine-A; muscarinic receptors | ABSTRACT: Acetylcholine (ACh) may be involved in the regulation of ovarian functions. A previous systemic study in rats showed that a 4-week, intrabursal local delivery of the ACh-esterase blocker Huperzine-A increased intraovarian ACh levels and changed ovarian follicular development, as evidenced by increased healthy antral follicle numbers and corpora lutea, as well as enhanced fertility. To further characterize the ovarian cholinergic system in the rat, we studied whether innervation may contribute to intraovarian ACh. We explored the cellular distribution of three muscarinic receptors (MRs; M1, M3, and M5), analyzed the involvement of MRs in ovarian steroidogenesis, and examined their roles in ovarian follicular development in normal conditions and in animals exposed to stressful conditions by employing the muscarinic antagonist, atropine. Denervation studies decreased ovarian norepinephrine, but ovarian ACh was not affected, evidencing a local, nonneuronal source of ACh. M1 was located on granulosa cells (GCs), especially in large antral follicles. M5 was associated with the ovarian vascular system and only traces of M3 were found. Ex vivo ovary organo-typic incubations showed that the MR agonist Carbachol did not modify steroid production or expression of steroid biosynthetic enzymes. Intrabursal, in vivo application of atropine (an MR antagonist) for 4 weeks, however, increased atresia of the secondary follicles. The results support the existence of an intraovarian cholinergic system in the rat ovary, located mainly in follicular GCs, which is not involved in steroid production but rather via MRs exerts trophic functions and regulates follicular atresia.']"
